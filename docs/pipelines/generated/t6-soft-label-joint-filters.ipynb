He wrote it around 1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all that.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.  Joe Buehler  ...  Schism and Disobedience  According to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the Church united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.  The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection of the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend \\\"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\\\"  It adds that \\\"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\\\"Not only does Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command, but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and his intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \\\"We pray for the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations last June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he is a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor heresy.\\\"  ...  Intrinsically Schismatic?  The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is not true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917 Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope, that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman Pontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the Church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in response.  It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The first part deals with \\\"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the Church\\\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the Church.  But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" which is entitled \\\"Usurpation of Ecclesial Functions and Offenses in their Exercise\\\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is Canon 1382, which reads: \\\"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication reserved to the Holy See.\\\"  The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder.  I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father Patrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs actuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel Church.  Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to      The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not     in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with     offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses     against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are     apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a     pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the     exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the     consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh     Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated     he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because     there was no intention of a breach with the Church.  ....  It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy, and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon Law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred excommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the Church and the salvation of souls.  Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce Association, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he knows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and the Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February 1989 Remnant merits careful study:\",\"  : I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of : the world  if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group : of the population.   I've been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties with Christianity. It is surprising to note that a large majority of people, at least in Finland, seem to be apatheists - even though 90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland, religious people are actually a minority.   Could it be possible that many people believe in god \\\"just in case\\\"? It seems people do not want to seek the truth; they fall prey to Pascal's Wager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believe reads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn't care - it believes, but doesn't know what or how.   People don't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle, they only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say that they are not \\\"born in the Spirit\\\", but this does not disturb them. Religion is not something to think about.   I'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless -  a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to. Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop, too many people take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow (and unconsciously hope god wouldn't notice ;-) )  : Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a : higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The : typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the : same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the : other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn : somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core, : than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it : expresses its own selfishness.  If logic and reason are valued, then I would claim that atheistic thinking is of higher value than the theistic exposition. Theists make unnecessary assumptions they believe in - I've yet to see good reasons to believe in gods, or to take a leap of faith at all. A revelation would do.  However, why do we value logic and reasoning? This questions bears some resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science: why mathematics works? Strong deep structuralists, like Atkins, have proposed that perhaps, after all, everything _is_ mathematics.   Is usefulness any criterion?  Petri \",\" Excellent point.

However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the center.  (These measurements are statistical, and you can always hide a sufficiently small number of a different type of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming that there is only one population of GRBs).  The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center of the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets way beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing GRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to be released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.  If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy) you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of the Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center (for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if they are Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in radius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, the Earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.   The aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don't see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.   There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature. Right now, the theorists have a sort of unofficial moratorium on new models until new observational evidence comes in. \",\" Yes, Colin... I have to agree with you here...

Just a strut going down to a lower control arm (single bushing: not an A-arm), with a tension/compression rod locating it in the forward/backward direction?   Anyway, simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using shorter springs, cutting the springs, lowering the spring perch or shortening the strut below the perch.  In each of these cases, the suspension geometry will suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the intended angle.  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom of the strut (roughly the height of the reduction) will restore the suspension geometry.  IMHO, the kit that includes the spacer is the only way to go...  --Ken\",\"Dear Xperts,  I'm developing an application that uses a Motif slider to select an image file out of a directory.

Does anone have any information  I'm not sure that this condition is \\\"recognised\\\" anywhere (in the sense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries between it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic features, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.  Post-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease by clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities are mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of ongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of declining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks. Musculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless contributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows muscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old denervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit action potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation (fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation with reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active denervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme staining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.  Post-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically evident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio, the patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one year to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio before who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among polio survivors than among people who never had polio.  The cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little evidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or destructive immunologic response to virus antigen.  There is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have anything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells, motor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than patients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration. Both groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason for these \\\"acute\\\" changes in a \\\"chronic\\\" disease (old polio) is unknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge numbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several years.  There are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio syndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny deterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe polio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain. They also tend to score higher on depression scales of neuropsychologic tests.  My take on this (I'm sure some will disagree):  after recovery from severe polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or degenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing pain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads to progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am perhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS patient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe that PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than non-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but without PPS complaints).\",\"I have a used Sony D-808K CarDiscman for sale.

We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the price was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide our lives into \\\"before\\\" and ''after.\\\" We talk like that: that was before the war. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole epoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live, it will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even  sharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now . . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those inhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our losses and everything that happened.  Nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it to pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would be such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and  those who didn't.  That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you  could already smell danger in the air. But we didn't think that the danger was near and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as my parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children.  My parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought that they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.  In our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the afternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all our family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin crawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel like it's all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our  apartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in  his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely  locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We're known as a  hospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people  who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends of many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.  My parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my  mother, \\\"Run to the kitchen for a knife.\\\" But Mother was detached, pale, as  though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never  expected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A  girlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said,  \\\"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out  of the bedroom. We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment.\\\"  We went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl  crawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and Karina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that  perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside  me. I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to embrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina  was thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. We didn't have time to  say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout.  There was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from excited voices. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door to the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time Karina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back, but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us  immediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at  least so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their  eyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst in, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. They  came into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other  room. He didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma  snatched the axe from behind and said, \\\"Tell them not to touch the children.  Tell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.\\\" She said this to Father in Armenian.  There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They  understood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian,  they don't need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: \\\"You and  your children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your  children that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls,  our mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,\\\" and  so on and so forth, \\\"and we came to do the same thing to you.\\\" This whole time some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They  were mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren't any older people  among them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town,  all the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I'm  a teacher.  So they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took  him in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there, because he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all  but a crack. We couldn't see what was happening to Father, what they were  doing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off  Mamma's sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: \\\"I'm old enough to  be your mother! What are you doing?!\\\" He struck her. Now he's being held,  Mamma identified him. I hope he's convicted. Then they went after Karina,  who's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying  to lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their  consciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they  mustn't do it. She said, \\\"Come on, let's straighten this out, without  emotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we  ever do to you?\\\" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come  into our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and  coming--said, \\\"What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We  came here to kill them.\\\"  They pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she  didn't cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, \\\"What did we do to you? What did we do to you?\\\" And even later, when she came to,  she said, \\\"Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?\\\"  That group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only  broke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they  were beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain  nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do  was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they did to her. That's why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off,  they beat her savagely . . . It's really amazing that she not only lived, but  didn't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they  could to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists,  kicking her, using anything they could find.  Mamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn't feel any pain,  just didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they  did. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the apartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the  corners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, \\\"Let's take her  outside.\\\"  Those beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they  weren't afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time  I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't  afraid of what would happen to them.  When they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered  with blood--that's when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several  times from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though  I were recording it all on film. I think I'm a kind person by nature, but I'm  vengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don't deserve it. I hold  a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time  I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I'd remember them,  and I'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me  \\\"forget,\\\" you have to forget, you have to go on living.  At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and  despite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had to do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering  to an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that he's being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me and took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over me. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that they planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up with their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a  really deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I  suddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly  I felt myself flying. I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I  just imagined it. When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the  ground. And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was  still lying on the floor. And since I didn't scream, didn't beg them at all, they became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with their feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe- cially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.  I came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it.  Some people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn't  need any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had  even forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth  living.  There was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman  pain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come  because I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself,  and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to put an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The  person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well,  because he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he  has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person,  one who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see,  even during the investigation he almost called me \\\"daughter,\\\" he apologized,  although, of course, he knew that I'd never forgive him. Something like that  I can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my  words, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person's shoes, but then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never  forget it.  I wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one  could protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of  beasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything. I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.  And Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a couple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to  kill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an  end to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into  the other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don't know which one it  was, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was  thrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her  and made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all  the deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor  from the Melkumians' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a  little. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku, how we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He's a good person. He said,  \\\"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes, I, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,\\\" he says, \\\"nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and  think I never shall again.\\\" The door to his apartment was open and he saw  everything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken  the father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He  saw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven people. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the  brothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that  they were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to  do something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I  After I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and  Lyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn't even  remember my sister's name. I wanted to cry \\\"Marina!\\\" out to her, but could not. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn't for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus I saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had told them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both there by chance, that they weren't Armenians. Lyuda's a Russian, you can tell  right away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that she was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I'm glad  that at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . .  although her spirit was murdered . . .  At some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that  mob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his  name, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, \\\"Igor, help!\\\" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were  taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and  Lyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the  neighbors.  And the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment,  something like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.   Then they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one,  they were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out  onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already  sure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new blows. Someone  said, \\\"She's already dead, let's throw her out.\\\" When they carried me out onto the balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I  heard someone say in Azerbaijani: \\\"Don't kill her, I know her, she's a  teacher.\\\" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can't remember whose voice it was. It wasn't Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an  accent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks Azerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and threw me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and  I having opened my  eyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had  been beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember him. I only  remember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately  I can't remember anything more.  What should I say about Igor? He didn't treat me badly. I had heard a lot  about him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too much. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that  women usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan, if he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated very sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in  Ufa, and was injured, but that's not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that  all out later.  Among the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary  of the Party organization. I don't know his last name, his first name is  Najaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn't so sure, she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she  didn't want to endanger him. She said, \\\"He was there,\\\" and a little while  later, \\\"Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else.  No, it seems like it was he.\\\" I am sure it was he because when he came to see  us the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something  entirely different. The investigators haven't summoned him yet. He came to see us in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought  groceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started  crying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don't know if he was putting  us on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned  him to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn't in Sumgait.  The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is  right, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don't know how the  investigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn't he have gone  to Baku and arranged an alibi? I'm not ruling out that possibility.  Ill now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she  bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her  wedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband's  lives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A  Russian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He's an orphan who was raised by his grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a  special school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I'll say this--I'm  a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that boy is not at all mentally handicapped. He's healthy, he can think just fine,  and analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he's cunning, too.  After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.  He beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, \\\"Lady, if you give us all the gold  and money in your apartment we'll let you live.\\\" And Mamma told them where  the gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and  everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other  over and taking the gold from one another. I'm surprised they didn't kill one  another right then.  Mamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was black and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she  ran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his mouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil- low. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead,  halfway into the other world. He couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see,  and was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth,  it was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.  The bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father  out of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room, a small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people  were standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants,  everywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee service--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, \\\"I was afraid  to turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the  threshold I couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and  dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'.\\\" Mamma remembered one of the  criminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her,  out of one eye. She says, \\\"I realized that my death would come from that  person. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.\\\" Later they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.  I was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina  was already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. I was left all alone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even though I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and Lyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out. I went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another.  But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones  I had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the  ones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and  that all of that would die with me.  At some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I  didn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that we were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, \\\"Neighbor, is that you?\\\" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived I would remember him. That's when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been  taken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to  take the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he  started getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room.  The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in  the air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the  presence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities  or not. He said, \\\"Enough, let's go to the third entryway.\\\" In the third  entryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once  again that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as  they went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they  found, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had  already taken the other.  Four people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. They had to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over those 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I  identified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an  Azerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian: \\\"Sister, don't be afraid, I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.\\\" That's just what he said, \\\"those Azerbaijanis,\\\" as though he himself were not  Azerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, \\\"I'll drive them out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails and nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41.\\\"  That's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the  person in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened  to, the \\\"general,\\\" said that they were going to the third entryway.  Kuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself.  Marina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I was racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer.  He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut.  But the door was lying on the floor in the hall.  I went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt  from flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find  anything. He told me, \\\"Well, fine, I won't leave you here. Would any of the  neighbors let you in? They'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're  alive.\\\" He told me all this in Armenian.  Then he returned to the others and said, \\\"What are you waiting for? Leave!\\\"  They said, \\\"Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her  yourself. No, we want to do it to.\\\" He urged them on, but gently, not  coarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just boys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went down to the third floor with them himself, and said, \\\"Leave. What's the mat- ter, aren't you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?\\\" And he came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that  he couldn't hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I  told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really good terms with them.  We knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman  opened the door and immediately said, \\\"I'm an Azerbaijani.\\\" He said, \\\"I know.  Let her sit at your place a while. Don't open the door to anyone, no one knows about this, I won't tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.\\\" She says, \\\"Fine, have her come in.\\\" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I  had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into  tears. Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a  half-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, \\\"Do you know where my family  is, what happened to them?\\\" She says, \\\"No, I don't know anything. I'm afraid  to go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see  who's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian.\\\" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my  neighbor says, \\\"You know, Lyuda, I don't want to lose my life because of you,  or my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.\\\" During the butchery in our apartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl earrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was  still there. When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I  touched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it to her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.  I went out and didn't know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I  don't know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I  end up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the  apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor.  I had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had  hidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near  some broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing.  Then they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I  think that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were broken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay  there without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town  could hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that's what saved me. They were  burning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started picking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father's sport  jacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the one end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out.  And again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive, and I started to  strangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on  my mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me afterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got  burned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone's hand was protecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't know  how. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if  I found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I  had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on  living without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I  thought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her.  I tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed. He served in  Afghanistan, he should protect her.  While I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I thought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would  she live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among  themselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no children's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter.  Another said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good  job fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was  all over. They started to argue. A third one says, \\\"How come you get it? I  have four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what I need.  All these years I've been living in God-awful places.\\\" Another one says,  \\\"Neither of you gets it. We'll set fire to it and leave.\\\" Then someone said  that Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their place. And they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, and left.  Oh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite  frequently, \\\"Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let  them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians.\\\" Then they  said, \\\"Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!\\\" They repeated it  very often.         - - - reference for #008 - - -  [1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,     Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by     Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D. Caratzas, NY, pages 118-145  \",\"I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly, (motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only \\\"real solution\\\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both  legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the \\\"internal nerves\\\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd  always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that \\\"force\\\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.  Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\",\"  Both Christians and non-Christians laugh at this quote because it exaggerates something we all feel, but know is not true.

Then come the Prophets (all the Prophets, plus Joshua, Judges, 1&2 Samuel, 1&2 Kings) and the Writings (Psalms, Proverbs, Lamentations, Ruth, Esther, Ezra, Nehemiah, Ecclesiates, Song of Songs, 1&2 Chronicles, Job).  And the veracity of Isaiah, which you quoted to your Moslem friend is quite well known.  A complete manuscript exists that dates back to past 200 BC, and is kept in a Museum in Israel.  It was found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, which greatly enhanced our knowledge of the veracity of the Old Testament, as they date back to around the time of Christ, whereas before, the oldest complete manuscript in Hebrew was from around 900 AD.  Your Moslem friend is sorely mistaken, but understandably so.  If Jesus was crucified, and atoned for our sins, he must have been God, for only the death of God could atone for the sins of all humanity.  And as Isaiah predicts, the messiah will be called \\\"the mighty God.\\\"  And if he was God, then he must have rose, for as St. Paul wrote, it was not possible that death could hold him.  And if Jesus rose from the dead, your Moslem friend would have little reason to be a Moslem.

I don't particulary like the Mitsubishi 3000GT's or the Dodge Stealths as they are too heavy and aren't very nimble handlers for a sports car. --  A motion picture major at the Brooks Institute of Photography, CA Santa Barbara and a foreign student from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\",\"SOMEONE PLEASE BUY THESE BOOKS!!!!!

I seem to remember it being called IMAGE or something akin to that.  Anyway, he claimed it had 48-bit color + a 12-bit alpha channel.  That's 60 bits of info--what could that possibly be for?  Specifically the 48-bit color?  That's 280 trillion colors, many more than the human eye can resolve.  Is this an anti-aliasing thing?

Analogies can only push an argument so far (on both sides).  Both Melinda's and yours assume the premises used to set up your respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise.  The important point to note is the different directions both sides come from. Christians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right (and duty) to tell the TRUTH to all.    Christians can get offended if others do not believe (what is self-evidently to them) the TRUTH. Non-christians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get offended at them because they (christians) claim to know the TRUTH.  (BTW this argument goes for anyone, I am not just bagging christians)  Neither side can be really reconciled unless one of the parties changes their mind.  As Melinda pointed out, there is no point in arguing along these lines because both approach from a different premise.  A more useful line of discussion is WHY people believe in particular faiths.

The keywords `Monthly Posting' will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of newsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos groups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don't understand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at least for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please subscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the documentation provided there.  Introduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:  rec.autos.tech  is intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design, construction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely inappropriate, especially For Sale ads.  rec.autos.sport  is intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving automobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply to competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints, spectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are largely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment. Discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid advocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)  rec.autos.driving  is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles. Also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert your pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.  rec.autos.vw  is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis, Seats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing list was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as a mailing list.  rec.audio.car  is not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however, the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and so is mentioned here.  rec.autos.antique  is intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years old, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)  alt.hotrod  is not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the rec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles.  alt.autos.rod-n-custom  also not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar American hobby of customizing older cars.  alt.autos.karting  for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.  rec.autos  is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.   Crossposting:  Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on the Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear in all of the newsgroups listed.  Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on Usenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular audience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector articles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.  Crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually inappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is truly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To: to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.  Crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of radar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.  Most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in rec.autos.  It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of articles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to misc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these three.  The life you save may be your own.  Distribution:  There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to (partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution field.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.  The distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing,  the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the following hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article headers, and on article content.  1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford Mavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in either place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange reason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)  2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which your car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences between a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise, all 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel injection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These differences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear. Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation.  3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting; in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas Europe is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos reaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.  4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when possible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can (canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state abbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted to send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put \\\"ny,nj\\\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated values are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area.  The Dangers of Overgeneralization:  To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article: Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is true for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a 1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly different from those in Idaho.  The Need for Adequate Specification:  When you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information; e.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year, model, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be quite useless.   Concerning Lemons:  At one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by announcing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all `brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from the `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information.   Concerning Flames:  As much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section of this posting):  If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a minute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and you'll get exactly what you deserve.  If you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe bald, unsupported assertions.  Be careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.   Asking the Question:  It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please send email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to end the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest I'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses to this request'.  Answering the Question:  If someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang. Either be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on defending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time -- it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly address the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see your words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and self-righteous.   Stale and/or Inflammatory Topics:  Certain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of them is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings about them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them ignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some of these topics include the following:  1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con  2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of     radar detectors.  3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.  4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why     rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue     about what constitutes a `sports car'.)  5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's     right to own and operate a radar detector  6)  `Buy American' discussions  7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates  8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible  9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?

If you are going to do a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they must have the proper equipment and people to do the job.   The BATF needs to be disbanded.  This out of control group  of Rambo wannabees is a danger to the Republic.  With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed more now then ever. If they blast away a few good fokes then that is the price we all have to pay for law and order in this country.   Well, I figure you're going to get flamed pretty badly by  everybody else for this incredibly stupid statement, so I'll  just let it pass for now.   Case Western reserve, huh?  Do the Feds know about that big   stockpile of automatic weapons and crack you have in  your  house?  Are you the same Daniel Oldham that lives on Orchard  Drive?  Just so they get the address right, that is...  Look at all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country of ours.   Well, it used to be a great country.  Now I'm not so sure.    I knew a few of those good people who died in wars;  I was  in Viet Nam.  I can assure you, none of us fought to protect  the right of the government to attack its own citizens with  military force without provocation.  (Hint: serving a search warrant  is NOT sufficient provocation to stage a military style assault  on a religious group.  At Least not here in the US.  Maybe in  Iraq, or Syria...)  With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with mega fire power. They could of gone in there blasting and killed a few women and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn to death 51 days later.\",\" Depending on how you plan to use your SUV, I might recommend also browsing Trailer Boats and one or more of those Pickup, Shotgun, and 4WD magazines.  The car rags mostly seem to consider recently graded pea gravel to be offroading and ten sacks of redwood chips to be a bedload.  Considering that most of these SUVs seem to be  used mostly as robust station wagons, that's probably not a bad approach, but if your applications are more demanding, pick your information sources accordingly.  Of the three vehicles on your short list (Explorer, 4Runner,  Pathfinder), I'd recommend the 4Runner as being closely based  on a rather robust pickup and the Explorer for being comfortably  carlike.

It seems from the following that the CPSR is atleats starting to question this bogosity:      ---------------------------------------------------------------- April 16, 1993 Washington, DC                 COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC            DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE          Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today called for the public disclosure of technical data underlying the government's newly-announced \\\"Public Encryption Management\\\" initiative.  The new cryptography scheme was announced today by the White House and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super- secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.          According to NIST, the technical specifications and the Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non-military computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of such standards.          CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in developing the so-called \\\"digital signature standard\\\" (DSS), a communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard. NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of records concerning its creation of the DSS.          David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of electronic communications, as reflected in today's official statement,  \\\"a step in the right direction.\\\"  But he questioned the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny.  \\\"At a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital that standards designed to protect personal privacy be established openly and with full public participation.  It is not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to play a leading role in the development process.\\\"          CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on society.

Basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins under his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit (which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).

For example, is this a public key system or a private key system? If the latter, then I don't see how the system could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and not the person).  Further, the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks. I would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks and a reasonable key-search machine, would allow you to read the traffic. I'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system, but it does make you think. Of course, this is easily fixable by  giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the  real 80-bit key.\",\" Of course posting some hard evidence or facts is much more difficult.  You have not bothered to substantiate this in any way.  Basil, do you know of any evidence that would support this?  I can just imagine a news report from ancient times, if Hasan had been writing it.  Newsflash: Cairo AP (Ancient Press).  Israel today denied Egypt acces to the Red Sea.  In a typical display of Israelite agressiveness, the leader of the Israelite slave revolt, former prince Moses, parted the Red Sea. The action is estimated to have caused irreparable damage to the environment. Egyptian authorities have said that thousands of fisherman have been denied their livelihood by the parted waters.  Pharaoh's brave charioteers were successful in their glorious attempt to cause the waters of the Red Sea to return to their normal state.  Unfortunately they suffered heavy casualties while doing so.  \",\" Do you believe that any quacks exist?  How about quack diagnoses?

The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise, since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time.  In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable. Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings, say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses the body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver. If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde, it is actually relatively non-toxic. \",\"Has someone a list of CD-ROM's with no SCSI-Interface and if known how much they are present in the market.

Smith, D.D.                               (1894-1977)            When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about      Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:                   Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son                of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief                priests and unto the scribes, and they shall                condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him                to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and                to crucify Him; and the third day He shall                rise again\\\" (Matthew 20:18-19).            Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,      who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving      reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He      knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious      leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that      one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual      death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly      how He would die--*by crucifixion.*            All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the      minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted      would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise      again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.            But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-      tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-      tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.            The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth      between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and      ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which      had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against      the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had      predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and      on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the      disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some      of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the      tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,      they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back      to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus' friends, Peter and      John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the      tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came      hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them      to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).            How did this tomb become empty?            One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--      professor of New Testament literature in a large theological      seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*      the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by      bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb      became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the      chimney at Christmas time.            But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down      any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa      Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the      tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.            Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-      bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by      mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.            Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,      tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar      in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)      that the women went to the wrong tomb.            The facts are these:            First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to      which by mistake they could have gone.            Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or      more people to forget the place where they have buried their      dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women      did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to      the wrong tomb?            Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?            There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the      evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.                    Now when they were going, behold, some                of the watch came into the city and showed                unto the chief priests all the things that                were done.  And when they were assembled                with the leaders and had taken counsel, they                gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,                Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole                Him away while we slept.  And if this come to                the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and                secure you.  So they took the money, and did                as they were taught:  and this saying is com-                monly reported among the Jews until this day                (Matthew 28:11-15).            This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the      fact that the tomb was empty.            You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never      questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to      see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.            Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that      the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples      came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*            How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?      Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.            Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject      the explanation, the very character and the later history of the      disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away      the body of Jesus.            First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in      Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to      contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His      resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there      had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,      then proved.            Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would      have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.      It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most      of these men did.            The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ      had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it      would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed      pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing      humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today      as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.            But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to      leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to      what had happened to Him.            Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.            He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning      (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-      18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He      walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that      night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper      room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).            A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at      the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren      on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the      apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-      8).            As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-      ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed      attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are      unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the      unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the      appearances.            Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our      leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are      antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest      thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.      Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;      Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of      Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president      of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.            But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has      it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:      it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.            Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He      claimed to have come down *from* God.            He said He was the way *to* God.            He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.            He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one      else had it.            He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to      us.            Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed      that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*            Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe      that His words are all true?            The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us      that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?            And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead      testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some      day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.            In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all      this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For      He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-      ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a      hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.\",\"   I have been for a fairly hard run in an MX5, what they lack in power they surely make up for in handling.

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test and a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were performed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter antenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis is in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed information relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.  3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network) advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone 70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees to 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.  5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance measurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC measurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and currently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  6.

The jealousy does not technically exist until the object is apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there even though it is not detectable.  Your description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven't attempted to define the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of each Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a similar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is easy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I misunderstood?   My p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and his writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do my bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth) is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this will probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the list of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element may come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his transactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.  I've had some more thoughts on my definitions:  I've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of the Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a graphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of frequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the spectrum over time.  Conscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature because Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often unwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given time which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with Freud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the urges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego, I suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is \\\"what provides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?\\\". I think I need some more time with this one.  That's about it for now!  David.  --- On religion:\",\"    NPR's Morning Edition aired a report this morning (4/19) on  Hispanic/Latin American players in MLB and how they have many of  the same problems faced by black/negro/African American players  when they first entered the league.  However, although baseball  has adjusted to the presence of black players, many Hispanic  players still labor under the stereotype of being \\\"fireballs,  hot blooded, flashy\\\".  The report also emphasised that despite  the rantings (my word) of Jessie Jackson about baseballs  discrimination against black players in its upper echelons,  baseball has actually done much better by black players than  Hispanic players.   Another interesting point was the language barrier problem.  The  reporter elaborated on an interview with Ruben Sierra which he  gave in Spanish to a Spanish speaking newspaper reporter with  the fact that there are maybe 2 major baseball writers that  speak Spanish, despite the fact that Spanish is one of (if not  the) easiest languages to learn, so easy that the author Cormac  McCarthy learned Spanish at age 50 in order to research his  book, _All The Pretty Horses_.  Yet, few MLB organizations  employ Spanish speaking personel, one of the exceptions being  the Oakland A's.   Another point:   Nearly 90% of Latin American players have some African blood.  Yet, most report that they'd never really felt black until  playing ball in the US.      Ironically enough, it is the early presence of Latin American  baseball players in the Major Leagues that support the idea that  baseball was integrated before the arrival of Jackie Robinson,  as many \\\"light black\\\" or \\\"brown\\\", Latin Americans were  incorporated into baseball.    /S\",\"    The argument goes as follows: Q-oid quotes appear in John, but not in the almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke. However, they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, and not an entirely different source.       We are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usual explanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not consider their respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Luke that of Matthew (and probably that of Mark).   As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text. The evidence for that is not overwhelming, admittedly.       When they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order on putting John after the rest of the three?       Sure, an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would be fine. So what's that supposed to say? Am I missing something?       That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.   The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel of John itself.

Please answer by direct email on <ghilardi@urz.unibas.ch>  Thanks for every hint\",\"The ONLY unity I've found which is true is when all parties involved are disciples.  I came out of a church in which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages (while none of them put anything into practice from those messages).  Since becoming a disciple, I've found that when I travel to another church in the same movement, they are just as accepting there as any other.  We had a retreat back in January when some of the congregation from Louisville, KY came up (this retreat was for college students) and it was as though I had known even the people from Louisville for years (and I had only become a disciple the previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky).  One of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is only one area in which disciples stand out from \\\"Christians\\\".  Also, another part of unity is a common depth of conviction.  I've also been a part of some \\\"Christian\\\" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved:  a lack of conviction about everything they believed.  That was why they could be unified, they didn't care about the truth but delighted in getting along together.  Creeds?  What need is there of creeds when the Bible stands firmly better?   According to the Scriptures, splits and differences of opinion are going to be there.  As per a previous note, I mentioned that there are those who teach falsely by many means.  There are also differences of opinion and belief.  However, Scripture states:      In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.  No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval (1 Corinthians 11:17-19).  How will God show his approval?  By fruitfulness (see Acts 2:47), but before that, there are these qualities:    devotion to the apostles teaching    fellowship    communion    filling with awe for God    all having everything in common.    glad and sincere hearts    praising God    enjoying the favor of the people All these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47.  God also shows that those who have these qualities are persecuted.  Look at Stephen, \\\"a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit\\\" (Acts 6:5) who was later stoned (Acts 7:54-60).     One can say that a church is the true church only if that church is perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.  I have yet to find that, but the closest one I've found is the Boston Church of Christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors pointed out and corrected.  It is also the only one I've seen which is totally sold out to God.  As for cooperation, that can always occur.  Unity, on the other hand may never occur.  As for those who think about only one church being the \\\"true one\\\", I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there are disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they will not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, I've heard numerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there that are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them any less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that they've ever run into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement. I know I haven't.  I must warn that this sounds cliquey to me.  A clique is a group which runs around together to some extent exclusively.  This causes problems in fellowship and causes divisions.  I would not say at all that this is something \\\"correct\\\" for a church/group to do for any reason.  In one of the churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique of people who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational heads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another office being \\\"opened up\\\" so that they would have to step right back in. Their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish he would've since they still have no clue about what it means to be a disciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be broken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such division within.  There's enough division without. \",\"I am looking for a WIN31 driver (or set) for my Diamond  Speedstar 1MB video card. Does anybody know of an archive site that has these?

I think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court. Currently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones, record calls without listening to them, and then post-facto obtain warrants and listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But this strategy wouldn't get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not in the near term.)  In other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence inadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to interpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I'd be surprised that archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything but analogous to a wiretap by the courts.  Note that that doesn't mean I think it won't be done if technically feasible.  Just as I'm sure many wiretaps are done now without warrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future, start surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause, decrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation gets a boost from data that, sadly, won't ever be presented to a jury.  While I'm posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this archiving scenario to extremes, read \\\"Lacey and his Friends\\\", a collection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the slippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don't worry folks, it's stored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can get to it.  And by the way, we'll be installing cameras on all major streets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and teller machines, don't we?  And then we'll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public places.  Then in some private places.  Then we'll make it a crime ever to be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy cubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and after.  But, see, there's still a right to privacy.  We haven't curtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it'd be to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a VR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.  And hey, nobody'll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.  After all, if you're not doing anything illegal...  Funny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became pretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn't elminate all crime in the story.

WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.   The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password   and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full   descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli   [BER91].    decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution.    There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,   Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will   decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox   files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you   think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a   call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files   that have a 10 char or less pw key.''  * How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?    A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the   plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.   If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the   following:     1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.   (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of   the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal.    If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something   over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different   key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes   of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which   indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.    2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This   removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since   English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of   text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing   plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact   one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)    If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a   standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis   texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in   the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.   See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].  * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]    Here's one popular method, using the des command:      cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail    Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called   PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through   1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.   There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this   writing.    There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting   mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own   newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ   as well.    PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm   without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)   in the USA.    RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which   is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside   the USA.    Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of   the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the   message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there   have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and   algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as   we know).  * Is the UNIX crypt command secure?    No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt   breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks   on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].  * How do I use compression with encryption?    A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by   some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).    Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact   distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's   impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse   characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up   more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy   has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some   redundancy in your compressed output.    Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they   have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that   actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of   UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''   that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.      This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a   bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means   removes the need for strong encryption.    Compression after encryption is silly.  * Is there an unbreakable cipher?    Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the   one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as   plaintext.    Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be   useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by   likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is   expected to remain valid.  * What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?    Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom   number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be   cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to   predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of   the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of   0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.    A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function   of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently   random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by   the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps   generated by a hardware random number source).    Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,   generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of   entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,   cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo    gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in   it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,   for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random   string.    When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is   important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that   because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \\\"random\\\".  For   example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be   unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a   clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.  * What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?    See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount   of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in   the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number   of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this   can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to   back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis.    Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have   multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security   from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.    Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic   measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives   probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext   for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible   plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys   are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally   deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine   the likelihood of events of interest.    Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than   D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not   enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of   possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,   which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to   8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but   the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work   required to find the key after approximately D characters have been   intercepted.    In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used   in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key   size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if   it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few   practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all   manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack   some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic   considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a   recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.   Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and   information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most   promising directions.    Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information   statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal   1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the   possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].  * What is key management and why is it important?    One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in   full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,   and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of   course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling   Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)   Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can   eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in   modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are   transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but   also enough key material to cover the traffic.    Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and   handling of keys.    A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology   is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use   employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key   Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that   certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control   personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and   to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the   reporting of lost CIKs.    This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management   problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,   many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''  * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?    Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from   relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a   linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random   number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds   and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a   high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically   this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for   cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more   complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---   but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable   structure at all.    See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].  * What is the correct frequency list for English letters?    There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than   the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:   namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of   English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,   but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.    The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do   you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a   fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It   has changed over time; it is different between different authors.   Any particular message will have different statistics from those of   the language as a whole.    The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have   exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all   reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.   In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other   buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood   estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a   text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with   reasonably robust answers.    So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will   be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.  * What is the Enigma?    ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of   information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by   the British during WWII.''    See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].  * How do I shuffle cards?    Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of   values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output   permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you   need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly   distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that   function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH   is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two   addresses given)    for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;    modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since   ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the   error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s   modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less   than y, go back and get another ranno() value.   * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?    Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with   possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted   separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps   even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.    As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard   PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the   keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be   encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in   part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one   of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.    If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must   be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in   the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.   The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the   illegal copy.   * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?

That the BBC banned Paul McCartney's \\\"Give Ireland Back to the Irish\\\" as well as John Lennon's \\\"Give Peace a Chance\\\" during the Gulf War.  Yes, England is very very funny.  And very pathetic.   So what.  Laughter is a way of dealing with things we find uncomfortable. I thought the \\\"Las Vegas Show Girl\\\" ads on Las Vegas street corners were pretty funny.  Yes indeed, there are many strange and wonderous things in this country. I wouldn't have it any other way.   I don't disagree with that, I don't think it's bad either.   So what.

When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they were a pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but looked unlikely to win it.  Now they are a pretty good team that is contending for the Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it.  A truly great GM would have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon of the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup.  A good GM (like Murray) can maintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level.  In the history of hockey there have been several better GM's than Murray- way too many to name.  Murray isn't even the best GM in the league today. He fails in comparison to Sinden, Sather, Savard, Caron, Fletcher and Quinn in my estimation.  I can't imagine how Bryan Murray can be the best GM anyone has ever seen in hockey- unless they have seen VERY few GM's.\",\"According to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking \\\"in X's name\\\" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today would call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus' culture authorized to conduct business \\\"in John's name\\\" had full authority over John's financial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to work only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes.  It was not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with \\\"in John's name\\\"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney and be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal and religious definitions of \\\"faith\\\".)  With this cultural background, praying \\\"in Jesus' name\\\" does not mandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous \\\"fiduciary\\\" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His Kingdom.  The message of \\\"praying in Jesus' name\\\" is thus closely aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God's delegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and responsibilities.  This idea of praying \\\"in Jesus' name\\\" is not only present but prominent in the Lord's Prayer, although the verbal forumula is absent.  The act of praying the words \\\"In Jesus' Name\\\" may be beneficial if they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the advancement of God's Kingdom.  For that reason, I'm not quite ready to say that the praying the formula is without meaning.  Prayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving, etc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by Christian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that's B.C.E. or C.E. for you P.C. :-).  I don't see anything in Christ's words to contradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His omniscience and grace.  Van Kelly vek@research.att.com \",\" No.  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost, and Ron Hextall is the reason Quebec won.  Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that goaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're Montreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it; he literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides, Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.  Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more).  Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than  five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME  ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear  the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to  play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.  Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this article, if possible.   I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who) in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in regardless.   Yep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second, IMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.  Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their zone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red  Army.    But I still hate the team.  On the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a powerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit.  Same goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is waving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.

They are: 1) humans are animal  *only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need  not be researched; 3) religion was \\\"made up\\\" by humans to address a  perceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that  is, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical  structure with biology at the apex).   Needless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the  underlying presuppositions.    I disagree that Christianity is \\\"an infectious cult\\\".  It has  certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in  spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.  That it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is  \\\"infectious\\\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides  a workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this  is the case).   I disagree that Christianity is \\\"a safety blanket\\\" which supplants  hope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one  Source of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a  Christian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to  you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose  and externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of  control over one's own life the problem or is it something else?   Finally, one does not appropriate \\\"eternal happiness\\\" by following  Christian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance  of Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people  from their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the  Christian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian  in the Person of God's Spirit.   Heaven is one of two final states that  Christian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally  not motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this  promised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived  benefits to them in the here-and-now.    Many Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a  priority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this  as a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate  priority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,  convert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).  Rather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting  the opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits  of a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful  that it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask  \\\"Why?\\\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-  plished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it  does not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian  is required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of  friendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot  evaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or  harm others if the sole purpose of being a \\\"friend\\\" is to gain a  conversion).   As a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-  ticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \\\"hurry-up\\\"  attitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no  conversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was  coerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open  to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).  The Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings  conviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part  (witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.    We are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die  just as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more  than this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is  so limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find  a more expansive view.   (For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing  arts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language  of other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?  How is it that humans can organize themselves in various social  structures whereas other animals have only one structure?)    Blatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.  Christianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not  a *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship  with a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-  knit relationship with this appelation.    There are \\\"Jesus freaks\\\" who let the emotional aspects of worship  and Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,  this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these  things flow.    Guilty by association?  That \\\"christianity\\\" which forces itself  upon another is not Christianity at all.    You appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened  2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?   I cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus' influence was a sole  result of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years  gone by this time.  It strains the bounds of credulity to assert  that nothing about Jesus' life was noteworthy _until_ the sack.    Christianity is having a relationship with Jesus Christ Himself.  What do you know of Him? \",\" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  As a muslim (spelled sometimes as Moslem) I must say that Muslims strong ly believe in Jesus.

[1]  Born 1964 Secretary-Typist Azsantekmontazh Trust Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization  Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan]   On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show, at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards  away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \\\"The Abyss.\\\"  Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at  the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation  whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it  was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if  someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There  were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that  large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well  mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an  Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that  they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do  to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded  a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move  over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone  recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina.  It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats.  Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis,  people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the  auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and  gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \\\"OK, we've  scared them enough, let's leave.\\\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to  me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of  \\\"anasha\\\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like  they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing  had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful  films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We  could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine,  and it was dark . . .  Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting,  something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially  listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to  make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation  wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police,  policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors  there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some  naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well,  since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super  serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we  live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the  driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and  he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well,  OK . . .  So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was  happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation  was at a standstill and everyone was shouting \\\"Ka-ra-bagh,\\\" they're not going  to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had  come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to  cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma  down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though  nothing had happened.  That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and  didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't guess.  On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda,  Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and  no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that  morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda  Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked, \\\"Don't they want Armenians? Well what  are they after, if they're already in that state?\\\" She says, no, nothing like  that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The  cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.  Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy  problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera, asked him, \\\"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\\\" Papa didn't know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home  and told Mamma. Mamma said, \\\"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on.\\\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian, she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I  tell Lyuda, \\\"Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see  you out.\\\" Mamma says, \\\"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can  see what the situation in town is.\\\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was  ready. Mamma says, \\\"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\\\" We sat down at the  table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything  out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating. We turned on the television, and the show \\\"In Fairy-Tale Land\\\" was coming on.  We cleared the table.  We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't  see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people  . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's  an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story  buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20  people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see  several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not  killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of  the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their  feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in  general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak . . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he got up and left or not.  I become terrified and go home and say, \\\"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \\\" Then the crowd  runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and  starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors  are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is  shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it  turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and  kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop  them.  They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the  windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard,  and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't  crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey  Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear  tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous  din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were  shouting Father's name, \\\"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\\\" or something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma  says, \\\"Into the bedroom, quickly!\\\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part  of our dowry; Mamma says, \\\"Hide there, they probably won't come in there,  they'll ask something, say something, and leave.\\\" She says, \\\"We'll tell them  that we live alone here.\\\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in  the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say  that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I  can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak  Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told  her anything or not.  Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them, \\\"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened.\\\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \\\"Get out of the apartment, leave.\\\" I  say, \\\"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the  apartment.\\\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, \\\"There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad!\\\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts,  commanding them: \\\"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\\\"  And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start  undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there,  in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how  much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The  atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among  themselves who would go first.  Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding.  He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It  seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says, \\\"Well, we're done here.\\\" They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs  . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the  window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the  windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking  about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong  person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be,  which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they  don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I  humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing  . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.  I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't  know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by  my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings,  something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death  come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What  happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.   I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me  clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember  that I said the same words over and over again: \\\"Mamma, what happened, Mamma,  what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\\\" I can't make  sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all  went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his  courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though  he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he  served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor  brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying,  \\\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\\\" How do I know who's who  and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when  they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda  said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going  to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's  hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our  sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding  on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in  there. So they survived.  My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back  up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed  there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put  it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and  knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \\\"I'm not going to let you  in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings  and we'll leave the building.\\\" Lyuda says, \\\"I'll stay at your place because of what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\\\" It was just for a  moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came  back to our place and lay under the bed . . .  I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone  number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he  came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were  simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct. There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly,  it was hard to breathe . . .  My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our  administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary  passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right  after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a  great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not  only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next,  without stopping. After us.  I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young  Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building.  Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in  Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \\\"Run quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\\\" At that moment  three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up,  there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything  out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to  scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you  here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of  the soldiers said, \\\"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the  Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\\\" So at that point the  Daghestan police were there.  When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously  injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they  were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda  and me and said, \\\"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't  know what to do with the rest.\\\"  So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My  boss said, \\\"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens.\\\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She  examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait  ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People  called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.  That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself,  \\\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\\\" She looks me over and  says, \\\"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things.\\\" And I think, great, I have to deal  with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this  condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't  have the energy to say, \\\"How could our people possibly be smart enough to  think of something that yours haven't already done?\\\" I stayed there. Then they brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her  own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next  morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything  more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer,  nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at  them.  I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \\\"Better to ask  your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can  better explain what happened.\\\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw  themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward.  Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me  clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress,  but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up  above my knees, and the woman orderly said, \\\"I can't believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\\\" I went back to my  ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and  brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I  couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one  had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . .  Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should  be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an  Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must  have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something  else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.  The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus,  and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening. I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many  troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw  a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought  that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait  after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't  come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine.  I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm  me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw  a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each  other and asking, \\\"What happened, what went on?\\\" Two days later they came to  see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed  interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they  could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues  who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions,  neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what  happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart  . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came,  not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part  of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I  lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be  from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular. When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of  insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful.  There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took  me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were  emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's  friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic.  They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I wasn't cut.  They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon  appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not  talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \\\"We  demand that Seidov come!\\\" The response was, \\\"It's Seidov who sent us.\\\" Seidov  is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said,  \\\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same  things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you  agitators.\\\" And so on. More of them said, \\\"Have Seidov himself come.\\\" This  went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us  out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because  they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The  smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who  had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a  club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay  to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day  someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill. Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie  theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it  was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants  took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in  Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to  mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting  right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only  the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women  were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come  any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered  together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie  theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to  the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and  couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently  they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my  eyes.  Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \\\"Aren't you an  Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\\\" They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in  nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their IDs.  So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't  spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered  the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only  the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself,  she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the  building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children.  This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were  already in the city.  They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire  families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't  see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult  now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify  the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard  that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people,  including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in Microdistrict 3.  They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who  had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were  going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply  savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did  what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that  hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from  the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the  ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and  she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and  beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that  whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and  carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.  I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of  people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a  song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has  that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song,  the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They  couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldn't remember anyone's face.  I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had  talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the  Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met  with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint  meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of  those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.  They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were  dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch  me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these  people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were all from Kafan.  The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was  there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't  recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since I told him, \\\"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\\\" He turned away  and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina  anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out  anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became  myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people  there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his  name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one  we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \\\"If he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his  alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not  responsible for my words.\\\" He said, \\\"What did they do to you, how awful,  myself, I hid an Armenian family.\\\" Then after some time goes by he comes back  again and says something entirely different: \\\"I wasn't at home, my family and  I went to Baku.\\\" I said, \\\"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally different before.\\\" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is  being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me  that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved.  What are they doing with Rzayev? Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the  head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an  insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the  same time  I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat- ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what exactly I can't say.                                                       When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it,  because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it  always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my  face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed,  they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41,  is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ  dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our  building was killed, it was that man.  A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come  over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was  all over, people started making announcements in town saying that  investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now  they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he  himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy  came to the plant and said, \\\"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the  bus station on Saturday at ten.\\\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to, went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do  you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent,  probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go,  because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had  killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of  that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that  the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from  I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word  I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an  Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know.  His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from  Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time.  His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani  KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many  photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at  curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this,  the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a  haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he  is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did,  I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment.  At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this,  all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look at him and thought, \\\"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like  you.\\\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything  without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when  she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had  all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters.  They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that  moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the  faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the  apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and  no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have  anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the  apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the  apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they  know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the  building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis  lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our  apartment.  I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt  when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from  our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \\\"Karina, we  saw all of it, how could it happen?\\\" They're asking me! Well I just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to  me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been  able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani  woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated  woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two  Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She  came down to the entryway and said, \\\"You'll come in this entryway over my dead body.\\\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some  folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't  even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They  couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani  stopped them.  They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place  they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the  apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that?  Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is  some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed  to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had  come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They  screamed and screamed: \\\"Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!\\\"  Only they didn't shout \\\"kill,\\\" they shouted \\\"gurun ermianlary.\\\" Gurun  literally means \\\"kill,\\\" or \\\"destroy.\\\"  That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their  kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part  of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the courage to . . .  A boy said to my mother \\\"Where's the gold?\\\" Mamma said he must have been 12  to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the  Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the  fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where  the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a  little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to  wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were  bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and  Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth,  bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had  shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and  tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having  trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and  started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted  to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by  accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake,  \\\"What's happened?\\\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \\\"At least go and  find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or  murdered them, at least bring the corpses.\\\" He went looking for us. At that  moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that  someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out  from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought  she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to  herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from  under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that  way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled  down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it happened in.  And Mamma said, \\\"Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting  something or other, and running toward the other building.\\\" It had more or  less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I  tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \\\"Listen; let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how  long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything.\\\" I don't get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe  not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \\\"Mamma, what do you need any of that  for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\\\" She says, \\\"No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the  night at someone else's.\\\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were  coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He  shouts, \\\"Come back, they're coming!\\\" They didn't have enough time to get a  lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my  knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his  wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to  leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs,  they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building,  maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished  building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more  or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.  Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there,  something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even  live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and  mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television.  They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \\\"My  God, what is going on around here? When will this end?\\\" We turned off the  lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who  knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but  they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that  he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his  apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up  at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door. They tell him, \\\"Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of us.\\\" He went upstairs, and they say, \\\"Aren't you taking anything from this  apartment?\\\" He says, \\\"I don't need anything.\\\" And the women who were standing  in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were  standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the  first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time  to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty  pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really  mad, and he says, \\\"Where's the rug? I just put it right here!\\\" They tell him,  \\\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\\\" He ran off in that direction.  Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms,  there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They  just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man,  she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told  me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them,  the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \\\"Where's the girl who was here?\\\" And he became furious. The woman tells him, \\\"She came to . . . \\\" She didn't know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \\\"She came to and went to the basement.\\\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the  whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took  flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been  standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there  to get me. Then one of them said, \\\"There's so much water down there, she  probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in  the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\\\" I didn't know that, and  when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't  just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .  After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really  didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and  started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all.  Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people  who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think  that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but  they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole  brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\\\" That's  all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not  one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were  standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women  that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for  one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway,  an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom:  if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed  to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \\\"If you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\\\" So she left. That trick didn't work on them.  Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget  that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them,  then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister.  And no one did anything. Anything.

I used to think pretty much the same thing, then I got 'educated.'  People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how quickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick (within a minute or so) death.  The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are 'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.  Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by accident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as the attacker.  Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their knife attacks in prison.  If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike in 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3 seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the pointed end.)  Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth. Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'  This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman in L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All four of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.  The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk (a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually do this.  Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason 'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep us alive.  I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now know, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would have to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not fear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it takes.\",\"In <Apr.23.02.55.31.1993.3123@geneva.rutgers.edu> Tim asks:     This is probably too simplistic for some, but John 3:16 saus,    \\\"For God so loved the world that He gave His only son, that    whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life\\\".     Genesis 15:6, \\\"And he (Abram) believed the LORD; and He reckoned    it to him as righteousness\\\".     I don't find anywhere that God restricts heaven to particular    ethnic groups or religious denominations or any other category    that we humans like to drop people into. But He does REQUIRE    that we believe and trust Him. In Hebrews it says that God spoke    of old by the prophets (the old testament), but in these last days    he has spoken to us by His son Jesus Christ. And we learn of    Him through the pages of the New Testament. The Bible tells us    what we need to believe. For those who have never heard, I leave    them in God's capable care, He will make himself known as he    desires. It behooves each one of us to act upon the knowledge    we have. If you reject the claims of Jesus, and still go to    heaven, then the joke's on me. If you reject him and go to hell,    that's no joke, but it will be final.

With the success in finding Neptune to explain the odd movments of Uranus, it was postulated that there might be another inner planet to explain Mercury's orbit.    It's unlikely anything bigger than an asteroid is closer to the sun than Mercury.  I'm sure we would have spotted it by now. Perhaps some professionals can confirm that. \",\" \",\"Ok folks...

It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began, whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.  Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of \\\"election fraud\\\" to hold their jobs.  Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too many cases, who they were).  Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater of Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident.  The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner Auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive husbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room.  One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy. He said, \\\"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is always so organized every year.\\\"  I got a little pissed, and replied, \\\"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.\\\"  At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and several Simon's Rock anti-gun \\\"close-the-loophole\\\" protestors. (Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)  The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.  Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up to \\\"support GOAL's position\\\" on \\\"all bills.\\\"  First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students had some curfew, I guess).    Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock folks called the current law a \\\"loophole\\\" and wanted it closed.  Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \\\"SKS assault rifle.\\\" The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri, and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \\\"as strong as\\\" that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.  Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  \\\"In some of these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!\\\" (Oooooo!)  \\\"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't be having this situation -- but they won't.\\\"  (Naughty, naughty!)  Next up was Boston city councilman Albert \\\"Dapper\\\" O'Neill.  He was there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were judge, he'd give arrestees their \\\"last rights\\\" (pun intended) on the spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.) He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(  Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction -- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying, \\\"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted.\\\"  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.  Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable every five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible. \\\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\\\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the law-abiding instead of the crook.  The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga. Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \\\"restraining order\\\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He  was a co-sponsor of one of the \\\"restraining order\\\" bills as well.)  One of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \\\"every year it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\\\" It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been more effective.  At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue. Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was disconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \\\"public\\\" testimony; the other got a seat this time.  Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change. He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great quote: \\\"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state computer system until 1999.\\\"  (This was also an argument he used against the renewable FID card.)  Testimony was heard from several \\\"battered women,\\\" one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he got it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how 50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women needed to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long rambling circumlocution in response.  Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts. Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.  Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law. One of the junior reps noted that \\\"this is America\\\" and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga reiterated this, saying that \\\"people who abuse smaller people can go to Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order.\\\"  (Point and match, Senator.)  Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his citizenship \\\"expired every 5 years,\\\" and that a driver's license was a privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.  A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public hangings.  The speaker then responded, \\\"I'll make you a deal.  You get me the rope, and I'll tie the noose.\\\"  Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \\\"he wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside\\\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \\\"loophole\\\" should be closed to prevent something like this from \\\"ever happening again\\\".  Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of spilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually shot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on, saying, \\\"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are safe -- support gun control.\\\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \\\"Only residents can get FID's,\\\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out-of-staters completely off?)  Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by out-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident student -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental record.  One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \\\"elitist\\\".  Another (Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union had \\\"FID-type\\\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home state was \\\"not enough.\\\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming, \\\"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!\\\"  All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and GOAL's position) were:  o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull     licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)  o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)  o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly    opposed)  o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws     (opposed)  o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)  o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)  o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)  o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)  o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)  Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.  Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.  Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it. Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said, \\\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\\\"  The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It ended at about 6:30. -- \",\"I can't imagine why someone would leave their computer on all of the time to start with.

The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and clothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like their Polynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared many things with the other Islanders.  In fact, \\\"hi'ipoi\\\", the Hawaiian word for \\\"cherish\\\" means \\\"sharing food\\\".  The Great Mahele, in which the Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and the poor, was a white man's idea.  In Africa, villagers will often share tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village and neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been to Africa has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so- called \\\"theft\\\" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which, until the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\"   (See also Map 1.

The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.  A merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri  town of Khojali (Pop. 6000) in Karabagh, Azerbaijan, is reported to  have taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military  operation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the  Armenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been  massacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten  and shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed  the Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian  insurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of the Karabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City  hospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant  were killed. Azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to  condemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its  sovereignty.

I believe those patents also apply in Canada, but I'm not a patent lawyer or anything.  There is no such thing as freely redistributable code for RSA which can be used in North America without legal entanglements.

Like any other strong crypto software, it's not exportable legally.  It can be modified with permission from RSADSI, which a number of people have received in the past.)  For reasons that aren't entirely clear to me, RSA says that only U.S. people should take RSAREF from its server, although there aren't ITAR issues regarding Canada.

Between 1914 and 1920, Armenians  committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all conceivable methods of  despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol over babies and burned  them, raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound  hand and foot, took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated  personal property and real estate. And today, they put Azeris in the most  unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history.                                  AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.  \\\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\\\" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. \\\"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive.\\\"  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  \\\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  \\\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother.  \\\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\\\" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \\\"We have never got any of the bodies back.\\\"  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  \\\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\\\" Mr Sadikov said. \\\"I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock.\\\"  Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

The facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians  in any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently.  The idea that \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi citizens died is ludicrous.  Not even \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi soldiers died, and they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians? Either the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did), or they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to destroying Iraq's military potential.  The military mission planners are not fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war. Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you, not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrant-dictator.   How about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2? I don't hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but with smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are misidentified; innocents die.  That's war the way it really is. But the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like it's one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is worse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, \\\"I know not what course others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!\\\"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wishes to stay free.      Mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here. You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I feel sure that was not your intent.  So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I'm sure that appeasement would have worked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we shouldn't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor  French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We  should have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you'd be speaking German instead of English right now.  Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don't understand diplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is that Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad, so now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice (not to mention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait  was a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would've been better!  And as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why* the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of \\\"not guilty\\\"? Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape. But the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I have not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen.    Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused, whether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one's guilt, and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism.         Regards,\",\"  A brain abscess is an infection deep in the brain substance.

Now I just try to get them off my tail.  In heavy traffic I slow down a bit, mostly so I have more buffer zone in front to balance the minimal buffer behind, but I also often find that the  jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes, switch into one of them, and pass me - which is fine, because then I can keep a better eye on the jerk from behind, while looking ahead, rather than from in front, while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors.  In traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass, I might pull over, as if to look for a street number or name, (still ignoring the jerk) just to get the jerk off my tail.    If this all sounds, well, wimpy or un-Denizenly or pessimistic, or perhaps  (for any psych types) passive-aggressive, consider that I prefer to get my adrenaline jollies from riding, rather than from yelling at jerks.    A ride can improve my whole day, while yelling at a jerk is likely (for me) to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger.  In the worst case, yelling at the jerk could ruin my life - since even a tiny jerk in a cage behind me is better armed (with the cage) than I am on a bike.   On the other hand, you might try subtly arranging to be the last vehicle to legally cross one or more intersections, leaving the jerk waiting for cross traffic (and thus off your tail), or crossing illegally (hopefully in front of the waiting police).

It's only been in the last year or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature.

VW is really hurting right now in the US market.  Check out the article in last week's Autoweek about the crisis at VW.  Golfs and Jettas will be coming from the plant in Mexico, but they don't have the quality at that facility.

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt, reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.  Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch.  That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game, Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about  winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch.  Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any  that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible.  Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games.  I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play, he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.  But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan.    -- The Beastmaster   \",\" [... stuff deleted ...]  I have to agree here.

For instance, 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering' might be thought of as a plausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the contention remains true, just as '5 + 7 = 12' remains correct even if there is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor can they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding content;  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true in virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to action (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may talk of 'self-evident truths', but can he deny the subjectivist's claim that self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself.  To hold a moral opinion is, he suggests, not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human activity.\\\"\",\"How can I obtain public information (documentation and sources) about Xservers implemented with graphics processors?  I am specially interested in Xservers developed for the TMS34020 Texas Instruments graphic processor.\",\" Not true! Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality at any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason for your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font vendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being hand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.  TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting of diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the Windows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can be done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not just converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.   Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.    Hope this clears up some of the confusion.

Additionally, it is hard to say what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say how long you have been on it.

Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start azathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.

Unfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into emacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to change the source code so that all of these special keys generated character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier state as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence \\\"ESC [ 1 B 7\\\"  would indicate that the \\\"HOME\\\" key was pressed, with the shift key down.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such as \\\"shift-Return\\\".  If anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with it a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code in the source file \\\"x11term.c\\\".  Maybe if someone at OSF is  interested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've got bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about  emacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods  somewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it.  Notes:    * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create    its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which     includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual.   * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2    [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].  The patches are    in a chunk of code between '#if sun ... #endif' but could     easily be adapted for anything else. \",\"Since the wiretap chip is being distributed internationally, allowing the U.S. government to spy on foreign governments, companies and people as as well as to wiretap domestic citizens, this is a world-wide issue.

Regards, Vesselin\",\"The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory, a 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an NHL record 9th OT loss this season.  Roster move:  Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill  Injuries:  Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.  Lines:  Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-Hynes  Dominic Roussel  Game Summary:  I didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts I didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by a few things I did pick up:  First Period:  Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51  Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp) Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda, Har (interference) 18:43  Second Period:  Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00  Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09  Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38 Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski, Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50  Third Period:  Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)  Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11  Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38 Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30  Overtime:  Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15. Penalties - None  Power Play:  Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4  Goalies:  Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)  Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)  On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took off.  The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.  The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie.  On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in. This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner, Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the play.  That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored, much less how.  From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy  Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark. But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????  What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...  #1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice. The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey next season.  #2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour, and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.  #3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season. Not a tough choice.  Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.  Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman in years to come.  Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some things you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome, he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year.  Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total. But consistency became a problem for him.

If you're interested, you can send him mail at:  att!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK  The FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning percentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in Patrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as many goals as they allowed, 319.  The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.

I have a problem with the cursor within Xterm on MONO (not grayscale monitors) The problem is that when I have an character application that displays input fields in reverse video the Xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the input field.  The solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather than a block, but how do you do this. I can't find any means although various sources seem to indicate it can be done.  When the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block. This would also be preferable but I can't seem to force this to be the default either.

How is this supposed to work?\",\" I agree with this assessment.  Furthermore, its promotion as providing greater protection than bare voice is quite true, as far as it goes.  However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal of letting LE wiretap \\\"terrorists and drug dealers\\\" is to restrict stronger techniques.    Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption, weak encryption, or (the vast majority) no encryption.  The latter two classes can be tapped.  With weak encryption in every phone, the no-encryption class is merged into the weak-encryption class.  Will the introduction of Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strong privacy to give up on it?  that is, to rely for privacy on a system expressly designed to deny it to people like them?  I doubt it.  The mere introduction of this scheme will give the government *nothing*.  The stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretapping capabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domestic cryptography, and only by this restriction.  \\\"Clipper\\\" appears to be no more than a sop, given to the public to mute any complaints.  We would find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff, but I fear the public at large will not care.  I hate to even mention gun control, but most people seem to think that an `assault weapon' (as the NYT uses the word) is some sort of automatic weapon, .50 caliber maybe.  Who wants to have such a thing legal?  Well, people know even less about cryptology; I suspect that strong cryptography could easily be labeled \\\"too much secrecy for law-abiding citizens to need\\\".   What they say is opinion, but what they do is what matters, and will continue unless overturned.  And the courts are reluctant to annul law or regulation, going to some length to decide cases on other grounds.  Furthermore, Congress can get away with quite a bit.  They could levy a burdensome tax; this would place enforcement in the hands of the BATF, who as we've seen you really don't want on your case.  They could invoke the Commerce Clause; this seems most likely.  This clause will get you anywhere these days.  The 18th was required because the Supreme Court ruled a prohibitory statute unconstitutional.  In 1970 Congress prohibited many drugs, with a textual nod to the Commerce Clause.  The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 still stands.  I think the government could get away with it. \",\" Damn right.

In case this puzzles people, I would like to expand on two of her comments.   One of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context, scope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces of evidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break the back of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to be filled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is a grave mistake to confuse these.  Past snippets from this thread:    Back to Lee Lady:   These posters are making the mistake that I have previously criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A \\\"carefully designed and controlled study\\\" is neither always possible nor always important.  (On the other hand, if someone is proposing a remedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, we have enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kind of claim to ask for a \\\"carefully designed and controlled study\\\" to alleviate our skepticism.)  Rules such as \\\"support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and controlled study\\\" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation. I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.  (To reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical problems are notoriously problematic.)  \",\" For some reason the name Grayhill springs to mind -- saw something like that in a Grayhill catalog, along with options for custom printed overlays and a neat little electroluuminescent backing that would make the whole shebang glow a nice shade of green ..  mighty handy if you're trying to key a door combination in the dark and don't want to TURN ON THE &%#$!!

I am more used to the dip stick for a cage where the stick is extracted fully, wiped clean and reinserted fully, then withdrawn and read.  The dip stick on my bike is part of the oil filler cap and has about 1/2 inch of threads on it.  Do I remove the cap, wipe the stick clean and reinsert it with/without screwing it down before reading?  The service manual calls for the application of Suzuki Bond No. 1207B on the head cover.

A new national survey says drugs are easier to get, more teens are     using them and fewer deem drug use as risky.       For the last two years, government officials have trumpeted results     from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is     being won.  But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by     eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students     nationwide.      Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If     drug use dropped during the '80s, eventually some students will     have fewer \\\"drug-using contemporaries\\\" who act as examples of     substance abuse's drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,     one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths \\\"must be given     the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,\\\"     Johnston says.      This type of resurgence \\\"is possible,\\\" says Eileen Shiff, author of     \\\"Experts Advise Parents\\\" (Delta, $14.95).  But that's not the issue,     she says.  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today     could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now.      Aggravating the problem:  baby boomer parents - who experimented with     drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to     their children.  \\\"I've even seen parents serving kegs of beer\\\" to     their underage kids and friends, Shiff says.  For a recent graduation,     Shiff and other parents organized an all-night, \\\"lock-in\\\" party where     no booze or drugs were allowed.  \\\"We need to fulfill that parental     role, otherwise the peer group takes over,\\\" she says.      Officials may \\\"talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven't     done anything that I've seen,\\\" says Suzanne Linkous, Scottsdale,     Ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and     other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line.  Linkous, a     member of USA Today's Teen Panel, says \\\"there's always going to be     experimentation\\\" with drugs.      A real war on drugs could be waged \\\"education-wise,\\\" she says.  But     \\\"some don't want to give kids the facts.  They think it will give     them ideas; it's the same with birth control.  I think you should     give the kids the information or have it accessible\\\" through classes,     pamphlets and speakers, she says.      Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in     kindergarten, says Dallas Owens, 17, teen panelist from Miami Shores,     Fla.  \\\"I remember in kindergarten, I used to see (drugs).  I think     kids in the 10th and 12th grades have already made up their minds     (about using drugs),\\\" he says.      Scare tactics in public service announcements aren't working; only     one commercial has gotten it right, he says.  The commercial opens     with two \\\"good-looking girls\\\" in the restroom talking about having     no prom date.  Then they take a hit off a joint.  \\\"That hits home     because it's not attractive,\\\" he says.  \\\"You can't be doing drugs if     you want somebody to like you.\\\"       Adolescents' choices      Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:                       Estimated, per 100 students                              1991     1992   Pct. chg.

This is often interpreted as the much weaker term religion.   The atheists are not mentioned in the Quran along with Jews, Mushriqin, Christians, etc. because the  latter are all din. To have a din you need a set of beliefs, assumptions, etc, to forma a social code. For example the Marxist have those, such as History, Conflict, etc. That they do not put idols (sometimes they did) to represent those assuptions  does not mean they are any different from the other Mushriq, or roughly polytheists.   There cannot be social Atheism, because when there is a community, that community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate  the society. When they inscribe assumptions, say Nation, or \\\"Progress is  the natural consequence of Human activity\\\" or \\\"parlamentarian democracy is doubtlessly the best way of government\\\", however  they individually insist they do not have gods, from the Quranic point of view they do. Therefore by definition, atheism does not exist.  \\\"We are a atheist society\\\" in fact means \\\"we reject the din other than ours\\\".   Atheism can only exist when people reject all the idols/gods/dogmas/ suppositions/.. of the society that they part, and in that case that is a personal deviation of belief, and Quran tells about such deviations and disbelief. But as I mentioned, from a Quranic point of looking at things, there is no Atheism in the macro level.

In Ontology, one can fairly conclude that when \\\"A exist\\\" is meaningless A does not exist. Under the Pragmatic definition of truth, \\\"A exists\\\" is meaningless makes A exist even logically false.   A problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a subjective god by definition, and there might be cases where a subjective god would even make sense. The trouble with most god definitions is that they include some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting all.

I've just finished reading S414, and have several questions about the Brady bills (S414 and HR1025).  1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill?      What is the status of these bills?  I've heard they're \\\"in committee\\\".      How close is that to being made law?  2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar.  Are there any important    differences I missed?  3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes:   A. S414 doesn't specify an \\\"appeals\\\" process to wrongful denial during      the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?)  (S414 has an appeals      process once the required instant background check system is established,      but not before).   B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approving      using existing records (so who would I sue in \\\"A\\\" above to have an      inaccurate record corrected?)   C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person      can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer (CLEO) of an      immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member.      But S414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a \\\"threat\\\", nor does      it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception      statement. True?  Have I misunderstood?  Any other 'holes?  4. With just S414, what's to stop a person with a \\\"clean\\\" record from    buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks?    At minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this?     'Seems at min. a \\\"gun counting\\\" scheme would be needed    (e.g., \\\"John Doe owns N guns\\\").  So, if S414 passes, I wouldn't be surprised    to see legislation for stricter, harder-to-forge I.D.'s plus national gun    registration, justified by a need to make the Brady bill work.

I've refrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with the OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to say something.  Many things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightest suggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the Gospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death of Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to break down these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  If Moslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't kill them.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions. There are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under attack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are living together peacefully.  The precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two different things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into Canaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have promised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be a holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those attacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be defeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in Joshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was possible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once that was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were expected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of agreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted Bosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior would have disqualified this from being a holy war.  The other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by Assyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel for her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a judgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay of the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because illness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God for good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn't justify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that in attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as *unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God's people, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were actually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action. Furthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are judgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, through his prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets to Bosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting, I am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But that doesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it from judgement.\",\"well folks, my mac plus finally gave up the ghost this weekend after starting life as a 512k way back in 1985.  sooo, i'm in the market for a new machine a bit sooner than i intended to be...  i'm looking into picking up a powerbook 160 or maybe 180 and have a bunch of questions that (hopefully) somebody can answer:  * does anybody know any dirt on when the next round of powerbook introductions are expected?  i'd heard the 185c was supposed to make an appearence \\\"this summer\\\" but haven't heard anymore on it - and since i don't have access to macleak, i was wondering if anybody out there had more info...  * has anybody heard rumors about price drops to the powerbook line like the ones the duo's just went through recently?  * what's the impression of the display on the 180?  i could probably swing a 180 if i got the 80Mb disk rather than the 120, but i don't really have a feel for how much \\\"better\\\" the display is (yea, it looks great in the store, but is that all \\\"wow\\\" or is it really that good?).  could i solicit some opinions of people who use the 160 and 180 day-to-day on if its worth taking the disk size and money hit to get the active display?

I am thinking   of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know   that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I   can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about   $400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,   the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that   the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather   avoid...  So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work   well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about   $90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how   do they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the   extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the   ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so   probably all of this is just wishful thinking...

I think we need to distinguish etymology from meaning.  Regardless of how the word 'Easter' *originated*, the fact is that it does not *now* mean anything to Christians other than 'the feast day of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ'.   The meaning of a word is _only_ what people understand it to mean.  And the same goes for other cultural practices.  The festival of Easter may possibly have some historical association with some pagan festival, but *today* there are, as far as I know, no Christians who *intend* to honor any kind of \\\"pagan goddess\\\" by celebrating Easter.  It is nonsense to say \\\"this word (or this practice) 'really' means so- and-so even though nobody realizes it.\\\"  Words and practices don't mean things, people do.

To increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed from 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively. This is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some aluminum foil down to work on.  1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case.  2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables,   spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out.  3. Remove the flopy drive.  4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting   the supply straight up and out.  5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom   side of the fan and lifting straight up and out.  6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and   right side of the board and sliding the board forward then   lifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the   board must be removed first)  7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules).   This is not easy even for a skilled solderer.  8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins   by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.  9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder    them in.  10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.  11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and    the other large chip just to the right of the processor and   figure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made a   simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole   in the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using   insulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat   sync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.   12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.

Have you ever asked a physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog? The answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind person cannot.   I acknowledge, as a Christian, that I am blind.  I see, but I see  illusions as well as reality.  (Watched TV lately?) I hear, but I hear lies as well as truth.  (Listen to your  radio or read a newspaper.)  Remember, all that tastes well is not healthy.  So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, and taste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not. That is God.   Of course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses, how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or a lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must force ourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves us enough to share it with us, even when it defies what we think we know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us  enough to help us through this world?   I also do trust my experiences to some extent.  When I do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience,  because it is what my Father commands me to do, and I see the results in the long term, I find that He has led me in the proper direction, even though it did not feel right at the time.  This is where our works as Christians are important:  As exercises of the body make the body strong, excercises of faith make the faith strong.     As for you, no one can \\\"convert\\\" you.  You must choose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever to follow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share with you the love we have received from God.  If you reject that, we have to accept your decision, although we always keep the offer open to you.  If you really want to find out why we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try praying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians about their experiences personally.  Then you may grow to understand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the logic of this world.

I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such \\\"storys\\\" about them. OK ? Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:    -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.          It has an hightech \\\"boiler\\\" but the rest is still verry verry           conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-          powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.          If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find          a chapter about the \\\"CARNOT-process\\\" which describes how to          get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason          for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an          temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one           side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water          again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the           energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to          let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \\\"cold\\\"          steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.          And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of          energy that carnot will give them.          The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !          The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,          because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in          AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent          radioactive pollution of the environment !              -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-          Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still          verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere          around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with          the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the          metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.          This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures          up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental.      -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever          possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the          years.

In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health insurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like socialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary insurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward. With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.  That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund is to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back in Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \\\"libertarian\\\" faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these).  I'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about leftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian newsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100% insurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't know it, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (American conservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who seriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about the Americans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germans who spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that shouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for insurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that the Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite being open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to spend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a different culture.   \\\"Managed Care\\\" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most western nations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France and Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says of HMO/NHS approaches, \\\"We left that behind with East Germany!\\\"). Sure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling doctors with budget strings.  In Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France and Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public hospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisions are different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked \\\"sickness funds\\\" over a century old while Canada divides by their provinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the doctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)  With such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 to the U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The French and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations in more compact geography to improve scales of economy.  gld\",\" Can't we move the political bickering to a more appropriate group? --  Brad Kepley                  Internet         kepley@photon.phys.unca.edu Work-days                    Voice            (704)252-8330\",\" National Rifle Association 1600 Rhode Island Ave. NW Washington, DC 20036-3268 1-800-368-5714 (membership) \",\"  Actually, Jerry Brown essentially did...and Clinton, in his demagogue persona, condemned Brown for it in the crucial NY primary last year.

(818) 354-5011  Contact:  Mary A. Hardin  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993 #1506       Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to measure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.       The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airport reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took measurements as part of a program established to correlate data with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).         The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle Discovery.       \\\"We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an ongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three important ways,\\\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on the balloon research campaign.         \\\"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\\\" he continued.  \\\"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists, and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own right.\\\"       The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring.  Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps scientists construct more accurate computer models which are instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.       The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL instruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere; a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the atmosphere absorbs sunlight.        Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three- hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130 kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground stations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m. Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded to separate from the balloon.       \\\"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared measurements,\\\" Margitan explained, \\\"and we also needed to fly in darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\\\"       It will be several weeks before scientists will have the completed results of their experiments.  They will then forward their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS scientists.           The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon Facility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a contract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was launched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.       The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds and is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.       The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements Program.                        \",\"Cathy Smith posting for L.

After reading the text some distinct questions arised to me, which I guess will also be asked by other people. Perhaps would it be interesting to find an answer to these questions ?    shorter or longer ?     First question: When will the LawEnforcmentField be transmitted, and how does the remote Clipper Chip handle it? Is it transmitted periodically in the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does the phone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever, or tries it to turn them into voice-output ? (Which would not be disturbing)    Second question: Why!?!? Why is such a strange procedure used, and not a real RNG ? This turns those S1,S2 in a kind of bottleneck for system- security.    So no (technical) provision will be taken to place a 'timeout' on these warrants? This would be a unique possibility to realize such a technical restriction, by letting the escrow-agencies perform the decoding of the session key. Just take modem-lines instead of secure fax. Is this such a bad idea ?    Wow! (How does the randomizer work?) Are the SHA (and Key exchange) secret, or publicly known ? Key-Exchange is DH, I guess ?  It seems that those who are opposed to this chip shall have a tough time, your government realy means to act. :-(  Friendly greetings,     Germano Caronni \",\"Thanks to all who responded.

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and  Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses  each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin  June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours  per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.   Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact  Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below.   ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO  UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.        ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## #######################################################################               JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon  University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific  communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and  January 1994.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the  United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is  facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.   PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to  develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:  1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time.  2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in  manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a  variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or  research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.   3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,  participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.   FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

That's a somewhat overbroad statement.  I'm sure there are HMOs in which the fees for lab tests are subtracted from the doctor's income.  In most, however, including the one I work for, there is no direct incentive to under-order.  Profits of the group are shared among all partners, but the group is so large that an individual's generated costs have a miniscule effect.  I don't believe that we under-order.  Then again, I'm not really sure what the right amount of ordering is or should be.

In fact, for the Bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a workable moral system created for everyday use.  The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of Israel were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.  It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo- Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was written down by man.  This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers have done).  Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I think the important aspect is the result.

I do believe that Whiten was a very good aquisition for the Cards.  He does not have too much offensive capabilities, but he is an awesome defensively. Since when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense?:) I forgot who St. Louis gave up for him, but it was not too much.   As far as Gilkey is concerned, he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan, who beat him out.  I expect to see a Gilkey/Jordan platoon in LF.   I agree with you on this one.  As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew that Lankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make a perfect throw?   I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don't forget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and went from last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/ Twins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant race when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I will never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading in the right direction.   One more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds, but with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the East), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than they lose.

I haven't seen anybody write that AIDS was a *punishment* for certain types of sin (this includes Mark Ashley who you were responding to here).  I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way that curses will come on you and others.  Although one definition of 'curse' is 'retribution', I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used the word.  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in his Bible.  God doesn't cause curses, he warns us of them.  Kevin Davis wrote (a while ago):  The Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death (which is much worse than AIDS) -- we have all hurt God with our sin.  Paul Conditt reveals his feelings:  The first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is \\\"obvious\\\"ly wrong to be angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angry which is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at us for putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was \\\"forgive them Father, they know not what they do.\\\"  Knowing how forgiving Jesus has been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of love for Him.  Please don't give in to anger, it will only cause foolish quarrels and more bad feelings.  It's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need to address it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone out there was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with AIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I would frame a response something like this:  \\\"It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which is simply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishment for people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of his children equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  We will all be judged after we die, but until then we all have the opportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him with all of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of our sin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new life for him.  Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is not to short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart or a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even through the worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all men that they may perhaps reach out and find him.\\\"  The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears of people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing is actually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in the earlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't been expressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount your perceptions, but please try to be open-minded.  You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people because they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters and I do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of the city and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with some brothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so that you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.  The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual contracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their salvation in that there may be repetence involved.  The important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God's commands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm or misfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way to prevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways, is to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife or husband.  I hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.  Love,\",\"AAAHHHH!!!!!  Please someone tell me what I have done!!!

Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites   is anon.penet.fi operated by julf@penet.fi for several months, who   has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment.    Including anonymized mail, Usenet posting, and return addresses    (no encryption).  Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.     Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk   remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):   pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX   scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to   aid remailer use).    ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu   -----------------------------     Anonymized mail.  Request information from above address.        elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu   -------------------------     Experimental anonymous remailer run Karl Barrus     <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU>, with encryption to the server.

Request information from above address.    phantom@mead.u.washington.edu    -----------------------------     Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site     address for information.    Notes   =====      - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often     running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues     are wholly unresolved.      - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP     software (see the question on cryptography).     - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)     vary between sites.    - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are     mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.  _____ <8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?       Users   -----    - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the     seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.   - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.   - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on     Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.   - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.     Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases     network traffic.   - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this     is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'     hierarchy is preferred.   - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.     references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for     readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any     inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even     future ones under the same handle.   - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your     identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by     sending anonymized mail to yourself.   - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them.      Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.   - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.   - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.     Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.   - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large     amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating     his hardware, all for your convenience.    Operators   ---------    - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an     introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and     consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and     monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and     security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or     lassaiz-faire?   - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate     potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user     is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user     posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your     users trust you to protect them.   - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations     where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.     warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke     the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)   - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.     Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly     and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with     users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under     ``(in)stability of anonymity''.   - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?     What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is     your commitment to it?   - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an     address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item.      Consult a lawyer about your liability.   - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared     to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you     do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system     adminstrator, consult those who do and are.   - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If     possible, query group readers.   - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message     format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure     the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.   - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from     physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.    Readers   -------      - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason     that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that     equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail     anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its     volume is heavy or increasing).   - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters     will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate     responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.   - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,     harassment, extortion, etc.   - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they     offend you personally.   - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the     idea of anonymity itself.   - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings     should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or     `conceivable' need exists.    References   ----------      See e.g. ftp.eff.org:/pub/academic/anonymity:    > This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual   > privacy and the use of handles.  It accepts the need of a system   > operator to know the name of a user; but suggests that the use of   > a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a   > letter to the editor. The article concludes with a set of   > guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous.  _____ <8.3> How do I `kill' anonymous postings?    James Thomas Green <jgreen@zeus.calpoly.edu>:    > Try putting this in your kill file:   >      >   /Anon/h:j   >   /Anonymous/h:j   >    > This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that   > contain `Anon' or `Anonymous' in them.  Not perfect and won't   > kill followups.       Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask   anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so   far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common   as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.    _____ <8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?    Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for   individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is   almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion   and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack   started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was   wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)   but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided   anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up   the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous   alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through   servers like there's no tomorrow.''      Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in   researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste   <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system   from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the   server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,   and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by   multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended   advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group   support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was   arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.''    K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an   anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus   against it.     K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to   `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and   used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of   intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his   server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to   abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the   facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was   created.''    In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most   controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on   scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized   mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine   the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide   accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.      J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet   newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological   opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).   Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,   abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than   ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of   anonymity is also controversial.    For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb   1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate   crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via   anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been   posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then   non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a   New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of   vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating   through many newsgroups.       The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded   that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''   suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was   not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of   the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived   association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries   for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous   user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his   detractors.    Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal   opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news   operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire   extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the   scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is   best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users   in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a   day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized   through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due   to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to   find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.    Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to   dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste   threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate   news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages   originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to   threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several   times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it   by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5   hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the   service's administration. In response to the serious threats he   disabled global group access temporarily for one week and   encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.      Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by   ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security   weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is   currently in the process of code development and testing. He is   planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon   to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new   system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple   email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,   etc.    A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.   1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography   in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of   confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public   access account, and he had to shut it down after only several   weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately   originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the   software to the public domain.    Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on   government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and   group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the   group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,   and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable   digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in   the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to   attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing   easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and   encryption.

My understandingis that former officer Cranston approached a teenager who was being questioned by another officer.   Officer Cranston struck Teenager A in the head with a heavy police flashlight, causing a significant, though not life-threatening.  THere is no evidence that Teenager A was doing anything threatening at the time.  Teenager A was released on bail/recognizance and filed a formal complaint against Officer Cranston.  The Police Chief suspended Cranston pending an  investigation into the use of excessive force.    The above is pretty clear... but what seems to have  happened is this.  The Chief requested Cranston's gun, but Cranston refused to turn it over until the Chief went the Cranston's home  to get it.  Sources said Cranston had always wanted to be a cop and was very afraid of loosing his job because of the complaint against him.  A few days afterward, Cranston allegedly walked into  Wilson's Garage, where Teenager A and friends were known to hang out and work on cars as a hobby.  Cranston fatally shot Teenager A as well as TEenagers B and C.  Teenager D was shot once in the shoulder/chest.  Teenager E was working under the car and was not noticed by Officer Cranston.  Teenager D went to a home and summoned police, who went to Wilson's Garage and found the  3 corpses and one unscathed survivor.\",\"Hi,  I don't know much about Bible. Could you tell me the relations of Christians with non-Christians in Bible? How should be The relations of christian nations with each other and the relations of Christian nations with other nations who are not Christians?  The other question is about the concept of religion in Bible. Does the religion of God include and necessitate any law to be extracted from Bible or is the religion only a belief and nothing to do with the government sides? If for example, any government or a nation is one of the wrongdoings according to Bible, how should they be treated?   Is there any statement in Bible saying that Bible is a guide for every aspects of life?    Thank you.\",\" |Hi, everybody:  |    I guess my subject has said it all.

There is only one way of determin- ing \\\"best\\\" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best that day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro- cess  used to determine the \\\"best\\\" is the score of the game and it re- lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.  To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.  If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the only measure of \\\"best\\\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base- ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham- pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub- jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.   Exactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with Clemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens. I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.   You don't have to be rude.   For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per- formance.  The stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new knowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less  incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.  -- \",\"Accounts of Anti-Armenian Human Right Violations in Azerbaijan #008 Part B                  Prelude to Current Events in Nagorno-Karabakh      (Part B of #008)        +------------------------------------------------------------------+       |                                                                  |       | \\\"Oh, yes, I just remembered.

They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan- ger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the  physical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had  an awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas ornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this  went on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and  was in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into tears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .  Then someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I  want to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am  silent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling me, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the one whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place,  telling him, \\\"I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring  her corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse.\\\" He went and returned empty handed, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his  apartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were  walking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls.  There was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.  They started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I  went down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the apartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be  cowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the  doors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth,  opened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle  Sabir's son started to shout, \\\"Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!\\\" He  knocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma.  Aunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their  apartment. I didn't see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying delirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother. All of my family had gathered there.     At the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the apartment.  Later I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, \\\"Lyuda,  Karina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. If she recognizes  you, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful.\\\" It was as though her whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one  side, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her  cheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole microdistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. I said, \\\"Fine.\\\" Mamma was  afraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started  to cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the bed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye  that was intact, looked at me, and said, \\\"Who is it?\\\" But I could barely talk,  my whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say, but rather muttered something tender, something incomprehensible, but tender, \\\"My Karochka, my Karina, my  little golden one . . . \\\" She understood me.  Then Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips.  She started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn't  understand it. Then I made out, \\\"It hurts, I hurt all over.\\\" Her hair was  glued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her  forehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don't know how  to help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She's saying something to me, but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil  and paper and says, \\\"Write it down.\\\" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I  can't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me  something, but she couldn't. I say, \\\"Karina, just lie there a little while, then maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then.\\\" And then she says, \\\"Maybe it'll be too late.\\\" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn't control myself.  Then I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She  says, \\\"Lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this  damned house. They want to kill us, I know. They'll find us here, too. We need to call Urshan.\\\" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I  understood her every word. I ask, \\\"What's his number?\\\" Urshan Feyruzovich,  that's the head of the administration where she works. \\\"We have to call him.\\\"  But I didn't know his home number. I say, \\\"Karina, what's his number?\\\" She  says, \\\"I can't remember.\\\" I say, \\\"Who knows his number? Who can I call?\\\" She  says, \\\"I don't know anything, leave me alone.\\\"  I went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was  crying, too. I say, \\\"Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can  we call him? Who knows his telephone number?\\\" I tell Marina, \\\"Think, think,  who can we call to find out?\\\" She started calling; several people didn't  answer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and  found out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he  was at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can't talk normally. She says,  \\\"Lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and  tell them that they just can't do that.\\\" She still didn't know what was really going on. I said, \\\"It's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's  happening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single  Armenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised  that we managed to save ourselves. \\\"She says, \\\"Well, OK, if it's that serious  . . . \\\" And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up  and that I'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. \\\"OK,  fine, fine,\\\" she says, \\\"if you're afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back  I'll send him over.\\\"  We called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly  under Aunt Tanya's, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian's apartment. She  wasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed  everything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on trying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and  finally we get through. She says, \\\"Yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your  place now.\\\" He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening, either,  because he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep  with his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what  shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has  grown up daughters, they're almost my age.  The three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and went down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No,  first they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As soon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said that we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might have fractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the first floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around eleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I  saw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies . . . everything just like a war.  They carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical people from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older  Armenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud  she would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle  Arkady, I think, because someone said \\\"Arkady, get an injection ready,\\\" he  started to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But  when he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his  sixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and  started to cry: \\\"What have they done to you?!\\\" He was speaking Armenian. \\\"What have they done to you?!\\\" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and  she started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. \\\"I'll give you a shot.\\\"  Mamma tells him, \\\"I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what  are they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people, and you're just sitting here!\\\" Some teacups were standing on the table in  there. \\\"You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my  daughters! Look what they've turned them into!\\\" They gave her something to  drink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the doctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa  and Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina  out. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I  don't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: \\\"What's  the matter with you?\\\" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter in the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's. I said, \\\"I'm fine.\\\" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told  the doctor, \\\"You leave, let a woman examine her.\\\" A woman came, an  Azerbaijani, I believe, and said, \\\"What's wrong with you?\\\" I was wearing my  sister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When  she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would  be easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed her. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge  wound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said  something to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be  dressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital.  They put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me.  I raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't  know if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, \\\"Lie still, you mustn't move.\\\" When I was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed  very familiar to me. I shouted, \\\"Stop!\\\" One of the policemen turned and says,  \\\"What do you want?\\\" I say, \\\"Bring him to me, I want to look at him.\\\" They  brought him over and I said, \\\"That person was just in our apartment and he  just raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.\\\" They said,  \\\"Fine,\\\" but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were  taking him.  Then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were  sitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car  up closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, \\\"Sister . . . \\\" I don't  remember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they did to us. I asked him, \\\"Where are you from?\\\" He said that he was from Ufa.  Apparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I  learned that they suffered most of all. He says, \\\"OK, you're Armenians, they  didn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian,\\\" he says, \\\"what are they trying  to kill me for?\\\" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the  balcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw  two Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed  against the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him with his own club. The way he cried \\\"Mamma\\\" made my skin crawl. I don't know  what they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before  he attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the third or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was  Azerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they were throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with  someone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the  yard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that I realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.  They took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too  and said, \\\"I've been beaten too, help me.\\\" But they just ignored her. My  father went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault  that he'd been beaten, and says, \\\"My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have  probably broken my ribs. Please look at them.\\\" The doctor says, \\\"That's not my job.\\\" Urshan said, \\\"Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor,  I'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them  to his apartment.  Marina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the  doctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I  wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very surprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the Hippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy-- coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she, having examined Karina, said, \\\"No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like  they did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women. \\\"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she would certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same  story. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no  drugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soon found out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And they started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at  zoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from  seeing it.  They put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have  any serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their  place, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira  her daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And Ira was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed. When they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she  involuntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again. Her daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful  when I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, \\\"Do what you want with me, just leave my daughter alone.\\\" Well, they did what they  wanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I  would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It  was simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do  every day: steal, kill, rape . . .  Many are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts  explained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those  children would be grown, and then, as they put it, \\\"we'll come take the  pleasure out of their lives, those children.\\\" This was about the girls that would be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow  because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just as there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be  of some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the  victims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, that they would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they themselves said that.  And this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many  people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know  why their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before,  maybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and  they weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at  nothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with  Marina: \\\"Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over  there [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman  shouldn't see such things.\\\" So they were really quite sober . . .  So we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all  happened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several  hours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what happened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk- ing to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when he thought no one is listening: \\\"Listen,\\\" he'll say, \\\"what could I do? What could I do alone, how could I protect them?\\\" I don't know where to find the words, it's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen.  That's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of  course he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail of what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke together in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never present at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And when the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present.  On February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital. First they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city,  the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier.  There were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family  there. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They  were sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife  and Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying.  Then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard. There's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area. They took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide. The women were shouting. They explained to them: \\\"We want to hide you better because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.\\\"  We went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We had children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to  have their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful.  They kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you  could see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the  police precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is  surrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were  standing on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought  great psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't  just walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48, or those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost  family members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened  when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a single person, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must have already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret  room down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at one another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those  people, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that the end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the  hospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my  parents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should  attack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an  Armenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and  she wouldn't be able to take it.  Then soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people  climbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers. They all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We  calmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some  little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children to the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never  have occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people  do eat.  Then, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They  were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from  the courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a  different woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing,  and calling out: \\\"Oh, Rafik!,\\\" but when she heard about this such a rage came  over her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her  sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were  soldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash  him! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not  one of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from  doing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands,  muttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile appeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round was over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing  terribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the  creeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did  this the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She  went five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women,  \\\"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they  raped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though  nothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?\\\" She appealed to everyone, but no  one got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I  could barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so  many hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already after ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the  elderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time.  There was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking.  The situation was deplorable.  At eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen,  Azerbaijanis. They said, \\\"Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash up and put the children to bed.\\\" Now the women didn't want to leave this place,  either. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with  dogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, \\\"Oh, it's our little  family,\\\" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for  the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone spoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded machine guns in their hands, said, \\\"Grandmother, you mustn't approach me, I'm on guard.\\\" Our people would say, \\\"Oh, that's all right.\\\" They hugged them, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly moving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.  They took us up to the second floor and said, \\\"You can undress and sleep in  here. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city.\\\" This was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other places. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the SK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I  asked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me. I didn't know what was happening there. They told me, \\\"Don't worry, the Maternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest assured. I say, \\\"Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in there is capable of anything.\\\"  When I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had already been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi- tal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once we were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met  acquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who  hadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with  them, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had  come their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like  they had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people,  hungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of  course the stories and the talk were flying: \\\"Oh, I heard that they killed  him!\\\" \\\"What do you mean they killed him!\\\" \\\"He stayed at work!\\\" \\\"Do you know  what's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.  And then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very  well and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small  room, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night  talking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary  of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see  Bagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed  from outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask  him things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by  soldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with  the people. Apparently he had more important things to do.  Several hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, \\\"Lyudochka, find another  two or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs,  lists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people  who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.\\\" I  had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, \\\"Lyuda, your  Mamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are  alive and well and that you're here.\\\" I gave the lists to someone and asked  them to continue what I was doing and went off.  The list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian's father, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels Grigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the  name of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said  that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front of the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later  it turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had somehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for  Krasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that  in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored  missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3  All the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were  contained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple  of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, \\\"What's  going on?\\\" He said, \\\"Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels they are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev [Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to him, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it was one or fifty.\\\" They told him that the list had disappeared and they should ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over again. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26 was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because that's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26  people on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only  a half of those that were on the first list. He said, \\\"Lyuda, please, try to remember at least one more.\\\" But I couldn't remember anyone else. But there were more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy don't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people  whose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims of the Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many  people left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns in Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the  Krasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that  there are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical  Krestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk  cows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went  to help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering the city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the  Azerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there's more. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list  drawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course don't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to  publicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court,  they simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of them is the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No.  8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know  her name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in  Microdistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the  same landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding  the door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and  when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her  braid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because  they didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one  . . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore.  They transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived for days in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there  and I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina;  it was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could  already walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the  social work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said,  \\\"If it weren't for the work I would go insane.\\\" He and I put ourselves in gear and took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers  and free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything,  although we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been  dispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it  was free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by to see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly visible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.  On March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir Fedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered  only Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital. Mother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.  Shirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I  told him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and record everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind.  We didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the conditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor  quality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there  weren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a  curfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or  video cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that  we can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially  to draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw that the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to  Sumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with  Bibishev, I told him myself, \\\"Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two  months, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in those two days, I'll help you conduct the investigation.\\\"  He and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I gave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to her, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her- self. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x- rays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eat and drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we were in Baku already, the investigator told me, \\\"How long can you go on like  this? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're not taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this investigation through. We need you.\\\" Then I started eating, because in fact I was exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart- ment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement cells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in every prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of Sumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary  confinement.  Thus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma  identified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn't identify  anyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren't among the  photographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one  who went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the  loose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know  his first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his  sisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that  even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will  continue looking for him.  The 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various  plants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect. Mostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only one of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and Chemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga- tor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front of me \\\"I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash simply for keeping him out of Armenia,\\\" that is, to keep him from landing in a prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if the investigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even though we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological pressure--they say, \\\"Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in an Armenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of you in short order.\\\" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.  The investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire pogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then that I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was  in our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and  all the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned  them, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials from the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James  Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were  boiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had  been in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's  enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't even know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did  take worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out  slippers.  Of those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait.  Basically, the group that went seeking \\\"revenge\\\"--let's use their word for  it--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with  one of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that  black I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking part in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of  Tamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently arrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I  don't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an  Azerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know  nothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an  axe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and  threw them into the tub with water.  I remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You  know, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both  their hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey- eyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I  identified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born in the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How  did I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I  kept thinking, is that Rita or \\\"puma,\\\" which it would be if you read the word  as Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic \\\"T\\\" was the one  that looks like a Latin \\\"M.\\\" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind his back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to put in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and  told me that I was making a mistake, and called me \\\"dear sister.\\\" He said,  \\\"You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an  Armenian,\\\" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator  asked me, \\\"Lyuda, are you sure it was he?\\\" I told him, \\\"I'll tell you one more identifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The  name Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.\\\" He went rigid and became  pale. They told him, \\\"Put your hands on the table.\\\" He put his hands on the table with the palms up. I said, \\\"Now turn your hands over,\\\" but he didn't  turn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they  forced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently. But he insolently stuck to his story, \\\"No, I did not do anything, it wasn't  me.\\\" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his hand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew into a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out  of granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it.  Catching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked and the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and  back. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how,  but I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or  strangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the  microphone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his last name, and he says, \\\"Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . . \\\" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped.  They took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down,  because we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, \\\"You're  some actress! What a performance!\\\" I said, \\\"Tolya, honestly . . . \\\" Beforehand they would always tell me, \\\"Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if  nothing had happened to you.\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have any more strength or  emotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength  . . . I don't have the strength to do anything.\\\" And he says, \\\"Lyuda, how were you able to do that?\\\" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching the tape, I said, \\\"Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped  that high in gym class.\\\"  So you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of  the 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who  beat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.  At the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his  guilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among them were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said,  \\\"Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three o'clock.\\\" He said, \\\"No, I'm not coming.\\\" They told him, \\\"If you don't come  we'll kill you.\\\" He said, \\\"Alright, I'll come.\\\" And he went.  They also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He had also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a  motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him  out of his apartment and told him the same thing: \\\"Tomorrow we're going to get the Armenians. Be there.\\\" He said, \\\"No.\\\" They pulled a knife on him. He said,  \\\"I'm not going all the same.\\\" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed  him several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was in the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that  we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.  I'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he beat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he was very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for him, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning of Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our  apartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our  apartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I  don't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blacked out very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina because he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the courtyard, he remained in the apartment.  At one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her I learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't  have a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his third and, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work with bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.  The others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can't call them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying out someone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, \\\"I don't  understand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.\\\" But we know that they were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In the name of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam-- that's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do. Because I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about their level of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they work, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they  crowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were  promised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments. So off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, \\\"they  promised us apartments.\\\"  Among them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the heart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a  children's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at  the children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they  have they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or  grandparents. And he said, \\\"I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . how I ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my  own, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.\\\" And the whole time I kept repeating, \\\"Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife  right before your own eyes.\\\" He sat there and just wailed.  But that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a  marvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just  have to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his grandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how  to cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he  knew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed  himself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained.  That one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr  Gambarian was murdered. He came in and said, \\\"Let's go, enough, you've spilled enough blood here.\\\"  Maybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was  that they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya and her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They  liked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When  Karina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors  old me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to  the entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were  already at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came back and started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have  sustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older  woman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of  Karina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off. The woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands  and led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth,  he sees everything, and He won't forgive this.  There was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first  floor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a custom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them. But they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is  tantamount to trampling a woman's honor.  Now that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we  have gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these  events that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come  about? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that  without a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not  have happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis, let other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their  nations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are  a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for what they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they  threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done, to snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on February 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone  who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left for their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got as far away as their legs would carry them.  February 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came  into my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had  been a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for  a meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few  teachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or  seven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there  were a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the  evening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and  the crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the  microphone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the  driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani child off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had seen it himself..The crowd started to rage: \\\"Death to the Armenians! They must be killed!\\\" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because  people were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The  woman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians  cut her daughters' breasts off, and called, \\\"Sons, avenge my daughters!\\\" That  was enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the  direction of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.  We stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a  very nationalist speech. He said, \\\"Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!\\\" This  he repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him  stormily, whistling and shouting \\\"Karabagh!\\\" He said, \\\"Karabagh has been our  territory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my  heart?\\\" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. \\\"It's our  territory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated.  From time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from time immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years  the Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.\\\" By filth he meant  Armenians.  I heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely. Many people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with  the other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate, that in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our teachers said, \\\"Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's  spouting,\\\" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we  listened to the woman's speech.  Right then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the  subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of studies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I had considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to  obtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me, \\\"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If  they find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I  tell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?\\\" When he  said it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a  second time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already after eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered,  \\\"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until  twelve. Stay here.\\\" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in  kindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: \\\"I left my  children at the kindergarten.\\\" The director excused her. When she let her go I turned around, said, \\\"Good-bye,\\\" and left with the young teacher, the  Azerbaijani. I didn't see them after that.  When we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran nearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too  much for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed  off. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher  wouldn't say that I was an Armenian.  To make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at  the movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and again my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched  television as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last  day. That's how it all was.  At the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together, Zhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store  on Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she  doesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father  held the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the  ground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went  out on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the  entryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders  there. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the  moment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been  injured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor,  and their children: any way they could.   Where it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin,  Armen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims  what was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one  another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even  with muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and  their old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got  them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked  electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then  they took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an  Azerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director and told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to  escape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of  course, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only thing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The  Armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored  personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and led everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored  personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that  very moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves.  I heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big,  strong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a  strong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.  One of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking  for the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected,  people hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps  dead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went  with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found  Azerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and  put down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or  infection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the  neighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject  came up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the  basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor carried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing  as one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor  took his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything  seemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing  of ours he had managed to \\\"save.\\\"  Raya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended  themselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were Azerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some  reason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just  victims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too.  In the TV show \\\"Pozitsiya\\\" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that  the Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not  important, the truth will come out regardless.  So that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our  bravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the  years and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've  become, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.  On that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said that it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments received by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans  will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the  Procuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga- tion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on  the street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fear speaking our native tongue.

I am having the following 2 problems.  (1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like                 /**/#This is a makefile         at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C         preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that         I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the         line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the         start of a directive.           However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol         as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines         that \\\"This\\\" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my         imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better         fix.  (2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular         use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp         gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.  If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate information about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a later version of imake that I have not reviewed.)

Some titles I have posted here don't list every issue I have of that title, I tried to save space.\",\" OK, here's at least one Christian's answer:  Jesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes sense.  Matt 5:17 \\\"Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\\\"  Jesus lived under the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises of the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey God's purposes.  Verse 18 says \\\"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law, until all is accomplished.\\\"  The key to this verse IMHO is the last  phrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, \\\"accomplished\\\" what the  Law was supposed to accomplish.    Verse 19:  \\\"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\\\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish  people about living lives under the law, this makes sense.  In general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he  must have received about \\\"doing away with the Law.\\\"  That was not  Jesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it  should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his  people all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your  heel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be \\\"doing  away with the Law\\\" because he did not honor the traditions of men as  equal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious  leaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only  God's Law.  In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law  and defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon  on the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people  understand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which  had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.  In Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the  Law in this way:  [23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being  shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore  the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be  justified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no  longer under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith  in Christ Jesus.  I believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had  served it's purpose, i.e. \\\"our tutor to lead us to Christ,\\\" and now, \\\"we are no longer under a tutor.\\\"  The law has been \\\"fulfilled\\\"  as Christ said he would do.  God, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same personality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the \\\"last will and testament\\\" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles.  It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are re-expressed in Christianity.   On the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and  Christians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes  sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to  represent the \\\"mysteries\\\" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism  representing Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8), The Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and Sunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff, Acts 20:7)  OK, That's one Christian's explanation.  I don't claim to have all these issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome other Christians to offer other alternatives.  Please excuse the long posting.

Some other owners on the ford-probe@world.std.com mailing list have commented  about this problem, but I haven't seen it happen on my 3 month old  '93 Probe GT.  I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since  the initial batch of cars.  Also, someone said that Ford has issued a  service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem, so you  may be able to get your dealer to fix it.   Haven't seen any of these problems, nor have I seen these mentioned on the mailing list, so these might just be having bad luck with these.   Definitely!   No problems like these either.  I haven't been able to find any obvious  places where they screwed up.   Hmmm!  I got two keys with my car.  Something tells me you got stiffed by your dealer on this.  (Actually, if you count the \\\"credit card\\\" key that  came in the owner's binder, I got 3 keys, but since the credit card key doesn't have any teeth cut in it yet, I guess I won't count it. :-))   The latter is probably because of the air bag.  It's pretty much takes up all the space where you'd expect to find the horn.  Speaking of the horn, I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind. The previous Probes had Japanese horns.   Yeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.   I agree strongly with all of the above, especially about the engine.  The interior is very, very nice too.  Very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically sound.  ...  Yes, this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone.  I personally like it, but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car, I'd strongly suggest looking into the MX-6.   The problem with the back seat is that there's no leg room.  Plenty of  head room, though.  Shorter people fit back there without any complaints, so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to  give them a place to put their feet.   The power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car. :-) I really enjoy the moonroof, by the way, but then I've always been a sucker for open air driving.  No leakage problems or anything like that...yet!   I haven't heard about this one.  I know that some of the very early Probes ('89 and maybe '90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which Ford will replace at no charge), but I haven't heard about anything like this concerning the '93 Probes.  I haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot that was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my car.  I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering that I was expecting the worst from them!  From what I've heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with  the Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but  I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.  That's almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this, though.  Hope this helps,  -chuck-\",\"I am looking for recommendations/experiences of bringing Macintosh CPUs onto Token-Ring Nets. Can someone point me in the right direction for information. \",\"   Bill says ...   I presume the one you refer to is \\\"Space Sailing\\\" by Jerome L. Wright.  He  worked on solar sails while at JPL and as CEO of General Astronautics.  I'll furnish ordering info upon request.  The Friedman book is called \\\"Starsailing: Solar Sails and Interstellar Travel.\\\" It was available from the Planetary Society a few years ago, I don't know if it still is.\",\" OpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great, portable interface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications. It is not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL means that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable.   If your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI sales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a shot.   As one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in 1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates sped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5 years. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ('85-'89), the PI ('88-'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D's - '86-'90), the Power Series parallel systems ('88-'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics architectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every 18 months to 2 years.  These are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become almost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new platform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths, faster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we don't, we become uncompetitive.  From the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today.  You can't wait to buy, but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep for one in writing. If it's feasible, they should be able to do that. Some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as the Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge R4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.   If that's happening, it's becausing of misunderstandings or mis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our customer base.   Most SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule slipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments.   Five years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processor technologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at least 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is really 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.  There are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don't give up, we know it.

So, if you reply to this, please send private email to the address esther@demand.ed.ray.com -- I have set the Reply-To line to have that address but I don't know if it will work.

You'll probably need to do something specific, which will vary depending upon your news software.  --clh]  At any rate, I need some support.  (Much thanks to Jayne K who is already supporting me with kind words and prayers!)  I've been working at this company for eight years in various engineering jobs.  I'm female.  Yesterday I counted and realized that on seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at this company.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one; someone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.  I'm really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it could have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.  There was no note.  I do not know if it was:   - someone's idea of an innocent joke, that went awry  - someone's sick idea of flirting  - an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)  I dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask me some kind of question, I don't know the answer so I take a military specification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out falls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a Bible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to Corinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love Association?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.  I can lock up my desk, but I can't lock up every book I have in the office.  I can't trust that someone won't shove something into my briefcase or my coat pocket when I'm not looking so that I go home to find such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone wants to do to my body.  To make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to treat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for leaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go to the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one could be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my number was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a neutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite the fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being left in my desk drawer.  I need some prayers --- I can't stop crying. I am so deeply wounded that it's ridiculous.  I feel like I'm some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feel like I'm a sub-human piece of garbage that's not worthy of a simple phone call saying \\\"We're leaving for Mary's lunch a little early so that Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting...\\\"  Please pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously turned into something positive.  Please pray that whoever is torturing me so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. Please pray for my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a whole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new job in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such harrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This company, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment isn't tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one female engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or threatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven times in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company do me no good when I'm terrified or healing from the latest assault.)  And please pray that I don't turn into an automaton because of this. That's my bad habit: \\\"ignore it and it will go away\\\", \\\"you're not worth anyone's time so don't go talking to anyone about this\\\", \\\"you're right, you are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this way\\\", \\\"you are just an object\\\", \\\"you prostitute your mind to this company so why can't others expect you to prostitute your body there as well?\\\", \\\"what makes you think women aren't just possessions, and nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?\\\" This is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major depressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don't come into my head and stay there, triggering depression.  Please pray that this latest trauma doesn't come between me and God. In a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to God, and it's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can separate one mentally from God.  (I know God doesn't drop me from his loving hand, but it's awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the hand, look down, think I'm falling and forget that God's still holding on to me.)  Although this probably isn't entirely appropriate for this newsgroup, I really can use the kind of loving support you all provide.  For this reason I hope good Mr. Moderator allows me this latest indulgence.  After all, he's allowed me the thermometer note, and a few other off-the-wall topics.  Thanks in advance to everyone for your support and prayers.  Peace to you, Esther \",\"     --  Gosh..I think I just installed a virus..It was called MS DOS6... Don't copy that floppy..BURN IT...I just love Windows...CRASH... \",\"   Very interesting, but I also believe that you have presented a misleading argument.  Christianity is not the cause of the massacres and horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the fault of people who misunderstand Jesus Christ's message, and modify it to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter their ambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in the New Testament.  With every truthful and good message that carries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitable fact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distorted way, with inevitable consequences.  The Bible's message is that we are to love all people, and that all people are redeemable.  It preaches a message of repentance, and of giving.  Unfortunately, all people have deceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this message around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways. This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine.  One of the problems is that you look at the world through the eyes of Western history.  I think that you will find many, many cases of massacres that were instigated by people who never claimed they were Christian.  I am not saying this to justify the massacres that were, but I am merely pointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already.  Consider the world without Christianity.  I doubt that we would have the same freedoms in the countries in which we live, if it wasn't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ. Perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion (I won't name any here, though one comes to mind) which would not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such subjects.  Point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for power, greed and hatred.  Please don't point the blame at a message which preaches fundamental giving and denial, in love for others.  Yours in Christ,  Andrew McVeigh   p.s. I believe that a line of questioning like you presented is, strangely enough, compatible with becoming a Christian. Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviour of the world, and especially Christians.  I praise God for Jesus Christ, and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs and still come back to God and be forgiven, time and time again.  -- ***** \",\"Hi.

But there was one more thing to check:The original posting of Mutlu.I found  the original article of Mutlu.It is as follows:         ======================================================================     ======  QUATO IS THE SAME, REFERENCE IS DIFFERENT !  DAVIDIAN LIED AGAIN, AND THIS TIME HE CHANGED THE ORIGINAL POSTING OF MUTLU JUST TO ACCUSE HIM TO BE A LIAR.  Davidian, thank you for writing the page number correctly...  You are the biggest liar I have ever seen.This example showed me that tomorrow you can lie again, and you may try to make me a liar this time.So I decided not to read your articles and not to write answers to you.I also advise all the netters to do the same.We can not prevent your lies, but at least we may save time by not dealing with your lies.  And for the following line:  I also return all the insults you wrote about Mutlu to you. I hope you will be drowned in your lies.

As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source   given by Serdar Argic ..      You couldn't reject it...      Here we go again..  In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give   the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!  (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of  pages, please ask by sct)      I really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924) What I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in the given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your groundless accussations, etc.    [...]      I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)  and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published  in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you  are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..    Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)    First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You  called Serdar Argic a liar!..  I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...  (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)    And now, you are lying again and talking about \\\"modified,re-published book\\\" (without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..  (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was   first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty    well suited theories', as usual)    And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who  wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number  and page numbers again for the library use, which are:                    949.6 R 198       and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215                           Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying \\\"it is  not possible...\\\" ..If not, what is your point?    Differences in the number of pages?  Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..  No need to use the same book size and the same letter   charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!    The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year  first published..   And you tried to hide the whole point..  the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about  how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given   by Serdar Argic exist!!   It was the issue, wasn't-it?      you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway?     You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a \\\"crap\\\"..

Also, feel  free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists, the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian criminal organizations.

January, 1948: Arab Liberation Army attacks Kfar Szold                1000 men attack Kfar Etzion, 14 miles south of Jerusalem,                     after cutting off the supply lines to it. Attacks on Yehiam (Western Galilee) and kibbutz Tirat Tzvi. By Mid-March, The Jewish settlements in the Negev had been cut off from       land links with the rest of the Jewish population.          The Etzion group of villiages, near Hebron, had been cut off,             while 42 members of a convoy trying to supply Yehiam were             slaughtered, cutting off the villiage. Jerusalem was under seige, being cut off from its supply route from      Tel Aviv (the bombed out supply trucks have been left on the side      of that road to this day in memoriam).  By this time, 1200 Jews       had been killed.  Of course, this isn't war, since it's only the Arabs attacking. Just like last week when the Fatah launched Katyusha rockets against Northern israel.

I've been thinking about this, and if this chip/scheme is to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange, either using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme like Diffie-Hellman.  If there's an out-of-band transmission of a shared session key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping?  If the phone company or some other online central authority generates a session key and sends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble of having some complicated key-depositories?  Just ask the phone company for a copy of the session key for each call.      Now, it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of every public key used by anyone anywhere, right?  So, probably, there will be some way of getting these keys verified.  This might be a digitally- signed (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit, stored by this unit.  It might also be an online directory with access to everyone's public keys.  (This would introduce another weakness to the security of the scheme, of course.)  Presumably, if you don't use your designated key, you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips.      It might be useful to have a modified chip, which would allow you to use either the original public/private key pair, or some other key pair and verification scheme.  Unfortunately, this would not allow you to call most people and establish secure communications....\",\"I would like to program Tseng ET4000 to nonstandard 1024x768 mode by switching to standard 1024x768 mode using BIOS and than changing some timing details (0x3D4 registers 0x00-0x1F) but I don't know how to select 36 MHz pixel clock I need.

However, are there any users out there  with experience with the database package called \\\"Approach\\\".  It has gotten a number of very good reviews from the various mags. and it seems like it would require less hardware overhead than Paradox.  I have ruled out Access because some aspects of it are extremely non-intuitive, e.g. requiring a field to always have a value.  I like what I've seen of Paradox, but it seems like the resource requirements are greater than what I have (386/25 MHz, 6 MB ram).  So, please provide me with your thoughts are \\\"Approach\\\", good and bad.  Thanks. \",\" Wasn't there a \\\"plain\\\" flavor too?

This is the same anti-gun police chief that wanted full-auto Uzis for his patrol cars...).  Perhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago's finest, a close-to- 100% reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99% reliable automatic. I note that in Germany, where certainly the 9mm semi-auto handgun is king, some of the more elite police types want revolvers.  I don't think the issue is cost, because Chicago police certainly make on the order of at least $40K/year.   Your presumption of \\\"disadvantage\\\" I think is not borne out by the experiences of New York City's cops; there the cops usually come out on top with their standard .38 Spl revolvers.

Anybody knows compression-algorithms & -factors for voice ?  I've posted some info on CELP coding on sci.crypt.  Looks like you can squeeze speech into 4000bps if you have a fast enough computer like a sparcstation (or a Newton with the Acorn Risc Machine in it :-) )  This drops the bandwidth to so low a figure that it's feasible to run speech over tcp/ip running on top of slip down a v32bis modem.  Not only will this let us run point to point encrypted speech, it'll let us run speech internationally over the internet if no-one stops us by getting *very* heavy about regulations.  The thought of this, if the administration realised, would probably scare them shitless.  Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol for internet speech *damn fast*, allowing anyone who feels brave to inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our workstations.  Shouldn't be too difficult.  The CELP stuff is standardised, we use tcp/ip streams, and a protocol allowing silences to be used to catch up on any net lag, and also to avoid sending any data during silences (ie it's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each end because any net delays would add up to big voice-lags)  As for me, I'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as I get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone. It'll save me a fortune in calling my friend in texas every night :) (whether encrypted or not)  You know, surely *someone* is working on this.  Who?  It's so obvious, why doesn't it exist already?

One guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well, I saw one think that someone said about \\\"Show me a team that used Split- fires....\\\"  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.  Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and increased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires increased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing on horsepower numbers.  Now how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that depends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine? In the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque, but 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low. So for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.  But what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins, but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for the hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However, twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this translate?  Increased torque should \\\"theoretically\\\" help twins make more power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods or anything made, just stick 'em in.  Now I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with somebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than 4's.          As far as racing teams....  Ducati team \\\"Fast by Ferraci\\\" used splitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James running for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then.

Take your foot out of your mouth, I wondered about that already when I was a Catholic Christian. The fact that the contradiction is unresolvable is one of the reasons why I am an atheist.   Believe me, I believed similar sentences for a long time. But that shows the power of religion and not anything about its claims.       It follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used. Letting evil happen or allowing evil to take place, in this place even causing evil, is another evil.       The omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even before the omnipotent has created them. There is no choice left. All is known, the course of events is fixed.   Not even for the omniscient itself, to extend an argument by James Tims.       And when I am not omnipotent, how can I have free will? You have said something about choices and the scenario gives them. Therefore we have what you define as free will.   Imagine the following. I can do good to other beings, but I cannot harm them. Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good deeds, but don't make them long for them, so they can not feel the absence of good as evil.   But whose case am I arguing? It is conceivable, so the omnipotent can do it. Or it would not be omnipotent. If you want logically consistent as well, you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.

If playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then it is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times in 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is, some things will be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season.  But that is only for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with injuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really rather be playing golf, don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say this for sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I don't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically human attitudes.    With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing  money by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff \\\"take\\\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely to consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are going to come back with \\\"winning spirit\\\" and all of that crap but these players are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the  game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make a decent living.   Of course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is  being paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.  The second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions of the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top  after the long struggle of the season.

Speaking from experience here: I had to completely reinvent one of my designs some six or seven years ago when the disk file was zapped, the backups were all bad, and the devices were unreadable because of the security fuses.

Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team April 19; Q&A Following  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 19 -- Following is a transcript of remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine \\\"Black Bears\\\" NCAA Division I hockey champions:                             The Rose Garden   9:58 A.M. EDT       THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the Rose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win a national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.       I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory.       Coming from a state that is also relatively small in size, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears. In our state people are still talking about the time we won the Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was back in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine will as proud of this team as they are today.       You know, in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.) But after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came here.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does have one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish we had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)       In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In the United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority Leader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior Senator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger than me.       On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done a great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship game, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I know a little bit about.       Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a team, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from behind.       I think it's important, as I ask young people from around America who have achieved outstanding things in working together, to come here to the White House to be recognized and appreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives.       We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have them here today.  (Applause.)       (The President is presented with team jersey.) (Applause.)       THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful. (Applause.)       (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)       THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)                               * * * * * *       Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco this morning, sir?       THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney General made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions to her and to the FBI.       Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed?       THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions. That was their judgment, the FBI.       Q  Is this a raid?       THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to -- talk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be done, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical decisions.       Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this morning?       Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?       THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my quarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).       SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.       THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator Mitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.       Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?       THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to have for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to talk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and talk some more.       Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise.       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28 emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan and Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people back to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you   can do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position they're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year deficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time and then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their position.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to work.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful. We'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good about it.       THE PRESS:  Thank you                                   END       10:10 A.M. EDT   -30- \",\" One more time...

In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000 and that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops, British Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There are also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here it's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid without a pair of skates.  And before you say \\\"what does he know? He's from California.\\\" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia, a town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio play by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were the last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was on skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational hockey for about 35 years.    Lack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for the Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended, cost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club dues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues cover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless the city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.  By the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the \\\"inner city\\\" areas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an industrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther King, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown (I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west of 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town. Dublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive to run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice time expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them give you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and include the resurfacing time in the fee.  \",\"  Well, I've provided examples to show that the trend was general, and you (or others) have provided some counterexamples, mostly ones surrounding mating practices, etc.  I don't think that these few cases are enough to disprove the general trend of natural morality.  And, again, the mating practices need to be reexamined...   No, but mating practices are a special case.  I'll have to think about it some more.   Indeed.  But, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems are not the natural one.  So, the terms can not be equated.  The natural system is a subset of the objective ones.   I don't claim that homosexuality is immoral.  It isn't harmful, although it isn't helpful either (to the mating process).  And, when you say that homosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom, don't you mean \\\"bisexuality?\\\"   This is standard jargon.  Read any textbook.  The \\\"we\\\" forms are used throughout.   That's right.  The goals themselves aren't inherent.   You could, but such would contradict observations.   But a postulate is something that is generally (or always) found to be true.  I don't think your postulate would be valid.   Yes, and I think the goals of survival and happiness *do* work.  You think they don't?  Or are they not good goals?\",\"Way back in the early years (~50's) it took 8 wins to garner the Stanley Cup.  Soooooo, a couple of local fish mongers (local to the Joe Louis Arena, that is) started the tradition of throwing an octopi onto the ice with every win.  After each victory, one leg would be severed before the octopus found its way to the ice.  (They are dead by the way.)  It was a brilliant marketing strategy to shore up the demand for one of their least popular products.  Hope this helps.\",\"   I suspect you mean laparoscopic instead of orthoscopic.      By far the (still) best method to diagnose a hernia is old fashioned physical examination. If you have an obvious hernia sac coming down  into your scrotum, or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by increasing intra-abdominal pressure.... Sometimes is not that obvious. The hernia is small and you can only  detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal.  Whether you have a recurrent hernia, or this is related to the previous operation, I can't tell you. The person that examined you is in  the best position to make that determination.  Are there non-invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia? Every now and then  folks write about CT scans and ultrasounds for this. But these are far too expensive, and unlikely to be better than a trained examining finger.   ====================================\",\" There would be no problems as long as the OS didn't set up a DMA transfer to an area above the 16 mb area (the DMA controller probably can't be programmed that way anyways, so there probably isin't a problem with this)\",\"The best group to keep you informed is the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America.

I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting space, but I thought you might want some relief from the \\\"So-and-so is a thief\\\" posts.  Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be nice to hear some good news once in a while.  After seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a request for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50 in his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That sounded more than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day.  Imagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a message from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed the money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and assured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He sent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a transfer of license.  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him to fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times to get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for my signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the deal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world's best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good ones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat you may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my software from him.  Bravo, Mr. Miller!\",\" Actually, info@qdeck.com is our customer service department. If you have technical questions, you can write to support@qdeck.com.   I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the network itself. To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we have roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell file servers, and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on our Ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each segment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.  But the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486 33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have 10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns because you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.  Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth). It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also...)\",\"  I agree that a fully-loaded SL2 would come close in price to a LOWER-END Ford Taurus.  A FULLY-LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2.  A fully loaded SL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be somewhere around the $22,000-$23,000 range.  A base Taurus (GL I believe) might start around $15,000.  Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push $30,000 if you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstream Taurus sedan.  Your statement was not entirely faulty, just a little inaccurate.   Well, that's ok.  At least you're not bitching about dealer profits like some of the other netters are.  You seem to have rationally picked out the car that is best for you.  The Loyale is an aging design that is about to be replaced by the Impreza wagon, so you probably got a good deal on one of the last ones. \",\"         As perhaps some insight into how this sort of thing works, the local college newspaper had a big crusade to have the U.T. police release crime stats.  (The school claimed that to do so would violate federal education records privacy laws).  They swore up and down they weren't interested in student discipline records, only for stats so people could make an evaluation of how safe the campus was.         It was barely a week after crime stats were released before the Daily Beacon had an editorial calling for student disciplinary stats to be released, because they complained certain segments of the campus population were treated administratively rather than turned over to the police and therefore the criminal states weren't accurate.

OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression.    Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved one (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person having  recurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally, the individual attempts to ignore or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.   The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rather than being from an external source.  Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing, or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a source of the anxiety.  In OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the individual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair their daily routine and social relationships.  Treatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimes certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating obsessions and compulsions.  The standard diagnostic code for OCD, if you want to look it up in the DSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 .        kind regards,\",\"   I second that suggestion.  Although I don't own the HP Portable Deskjet, I *do* own the HP Deskjet 500.  It gives the nicest outputs, with only a minor loss of quality.   For all intensive purposes (papers, letters, resumes), I treat my Deskjet like a laser printer (You *do* have to look a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters).  Only one grudge, the ink that HP gives you does smudge rather quickly in the presence of moisture (Even though the ink is waterproof).  However, you would have to spend about $500 more for laser quality.  The cannon bubblejets are nice, however they don't seem to have as much support (eg: drivers for popular programs) as the HP ink-jets. Also HP Deskjet (regular,plus,500,500c) accepts xerox paper (I believe that the cut-sheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet).  If you don't mind refilling your printer with cheap ink (say fountain-pen ink), then the HP deskjets are *very* cheap to maintain (I paid $3.50 for my last bottle of ink and I expect it to last 9 months).    -Kimball (who doesn't work for HP, but just loves his printer     very much!)\",\"FOR SALE  Apple Macintosh SE/30 8MB RAM, 80MB HD System 7.1 Installed RasterOps 264/30 24-bit video card for SE/30 Apple 13\\\" Monitor Targus carrying case  I'm after offers in the region of 1250 pounds.

Pearson (one of my four favorite Leafs) played like a bonehead -- I saw him personally screw up at least 2 good scoring opportunities, and then he got that *bonehead* 5-minute major high-sticking penalty.   Cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand-full of games ago and he played a good game.  If the other players on his line can smarten up, that line should do okay.  Clark's got to get tough -- he's got to intimidate and go for the net.  Send Clark up the left  wing over the blue line a couple times... his patented wrist shot will put some numbers on the board... and Pearson... heck, maybe he should be benched.   I hate to repeat Grapes, but where the heck was Foligno?  Zezel can't do all the checking himself -- and get MacLlwain on the move... we  need some speed out there!  Keep Potvin in net, he did okay  considering... although (like I said a couple weeks ago) Potvin  messed up in a couple games in the AHL playoffs last year -- he can  easily do it again.   My prediction last week was Toronto in 7 -- that the games DET wins  will be blow-outs and the game TOR wins will be close -- I still stand by that.   Don't fret, Leafs fans, in order to win in 7, the other team has to win 3! :-)   Burns is going to make some magic -- he'll mix up some lines.  Match the Wings line-per-line.  He'll have his team checking hard, and he'll never let them get out-numbered in their own end.  The Leafs will win Wednesday night... and will take 1 or their home games (probably the first one).\",\"   How do you know it's based on ignorance, couldn't that be wrong?

While running the MS Quick C compiler in a DOS window under Windows 3.1  this evening, I got a \\\"program has violated system integrity... close all  applications, exit windows and restart your computer\\\" error.  I started to do this when I immediately got a \\\"Serious disk error\\\" message from Windows.  \\\"hit return to retry\\\".  I did that about 5 times and then rebooted to find that quite a few files have been corrupted somehow. (I am including the chkdsk output below.)  Questions:  1)  Is there an easy way to restore everything to working order? What might be some better approaches?  2)  What might have caused this?  Does the SMARTDRV cache make me more vulnerable?  (I'm suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they cache data writing.)  The straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the /f option to  fix the disk and then it looks like I would probably have to reinstall Windows and a few other things.  Thanks for your comments and suggestions.

It comes out of a background of 20 years as a senior corporate staff executive in two Fortune 50 companies.  I'd be happy to use a crypto system supplied by the NSA for business, if they told me it was more secure than DES, and in particular resistant to attempts by Japanese, French, and other competitive companies and governments to break.  I'd be happy to do so even with escrowed keys, provided I was happy about the bona fides of the escrow agencies (the Federal Reserve would certainly satisfy me, as would something set up by one of the big 8 accounting firms).  I'd trust the NSA or the President if they stated there were no trap doors--I'd be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined the thing under seal of secrecy and reported back that it was secure.  I'd trust something from the NSA long before I'd trust something from some Swiss or anybody Japanese.  This may seem surprising to some here, but I suggest most corporations would feel the same way. Most/many/some (pick one) corporations have an attitude that the NSA is part of our government and \\\"we support our government\\\", as one very famous CEO put it to me one day.  Just some perspective from another point of view. \",\"  Are you sure that he needs a two way converter? If he wants only RS232->TTL I would suggest the MC1489, its very cheap (0.80 DM in Germany).

Just the Skipjack  cryptographic algorithm? Or does it also implement a \\\"chip to chip\\\"  communications protocol? If it does implement a communications  protocol, can it be used as just a \\\"crypt chip\\\" also.    2) Where can the chip specifications and spec sheets be obtained?    3) Who may purchase them and under what conditions?    4) Are there restrictions as to how the chip may be used in a system?    5) The security of the algorithm and the encrypted communications does  not appear to require that the \\\"Family key\\\" be a secret. Why is  it a secret? What happens when the \\\"family key\\\" becomes well known?  If it's a secret to make traffic analysis more difficult, does  the \\\"Law enforcement message\\\" contain any random information?

Brand     rbrand@usasoc.soc.mil\",\" In fact, you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a project.  The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.  Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which dominates the cost of the project.\",\"  I am one of those people who always willl have unlimited stores of unfounded respect for people who have been on newsgroups/mailing lists longer than I have, so you certainly have my sympathy Tom.

Uncle Fester \",\"The DEA and other organizations would have the American people believe that we are winning the \\\"war on drugs\\\".  I'm going to dispel the propaganda that the DEA is putting out by showing you the drug war's *real* status. To help prove my assertions I've also posted two articles from USA Today that clearly demonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on the rise.  If WOD is working, as we're led to believe, then drug abuse should have gone down substantially by now.  The reality is, is that it has not gone down very much.  If anything, substance abuse is on the rise.  I'm also going to supply a possible solution to this problem.  The following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music and pot entitled \\\"Hello Again, Mary Jane\\\" which appears in the current issue of Time magazine (April 19, 1993, p. 59).      Law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing     smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed.  \\\"Perhaps     because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby     is out in full force,\\\" says Robert Bonner, head of the Drug     Enforcement Administration.  \\\"The fact is, they're losing the     battle.\\\"  In 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said     they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and Bonner     says it is still falling.  Bonner also offers a reminder that     studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of     nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.  The chart that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993 issue of USA Today (\\\"Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eigth-graders\\\" by Mike Snider, p. 6D).      Adolescents' choices      Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:                       Estimated, per 100 students                              1991     1992   Pct. chg.

I think you can see that one of the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that the \\\"war on drugs\\\" is being won is to selectively quote statistics--- only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone down.  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is an excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to deceive the public.  Usage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the same time usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution). Also, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone down but drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*.  Therefore, if one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all* the statistics, then it's obvious that the so-called \\\"war on drugs\\\" is being lost.  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs go, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants, then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed in its true perspective.  For those of you who don't consider alcohol to be a drug then try drinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me that it's not a drug.  Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal* drugs.  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless attempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch to another drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular.  The solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to legalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be within reasonable limits (you won't drop dead after using it a few times) and then couple this with a massive drug education program. The reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution is because people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the government's efforts to the contrary---the money spent on drug interdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drug education).  Additionally, legalization would reduce crime because the profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often goes along with other kinds of crime.  Not to mention the fact that addicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their money and posessions in order to support their expensive habit; legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall substantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts.  IMHO, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been done to smokers:  make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to employ heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating them.  As you already know, people in the U.S. smoke a lot less than they used to.  This reduction in the number of smokers has been brought about by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people can light up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco in order to reduce consumption, and so on.  I propose that similar methods be used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried out.  They are as follows:      * Drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which       states the possible health hazzards involved with using this       product and recommendations on how the drug should be used.       Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used       ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in.      * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of       revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs       through illegal channels.  Part of the revenue collected from       drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law       enforcement.      * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of       18).  Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the       taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent.       Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning       information should also be a felony.      * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the       purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible.  This       agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad       drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now.  I'm sure that many of the things I've discussed in this article have been hashed out before in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, I thought it was a good idea to give my two cents (actually a buck and a half...) all at once so you could get a good idea of where I currently stand on WOD.  Go ahead and tear into my post; I'm sure there is something in it that you may wish to take a different view on or flame. :) :) :)  BTW, I posted the articles from USA Today to not only help prove my assertions but also to provide information on LSD usage among youths--- something which I noticed some posters to this group were interested in.

SCSI means \\\"The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2\\\" NOT 'SCSI-1' as some people want to use it.

Space Science Dept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail proposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting. Here goes :      The Microlight Solar Sail    -------------------------  1. Introduction The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.  However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.  2.Design Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control methods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.  The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.  3.Missions The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example: a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit rate. b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base, BTW] c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged tube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an ideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300 deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating container.

I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN$14000 right now. The car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it. A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43K mi). The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards.  (He said he will replace the components before selling the car to me.)  Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, I don't know what this could mean... Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items? Or is this an indication that the car was abused? Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon? The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but, I don't know how to verify this...  I've seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though.  Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept, it's currently out of warranty (a similarly priced '90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km worth of warranty left) and I don't want to worry about paying for any repair bills...

I'd like to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation consoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.  We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes, and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control circuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.  I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the cue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one problem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be a sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute, so to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid cuetape!)  Ideally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function. (A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film) This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second. What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit of some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!

Today I was turning a 90 degree corner just like on any other day, but there was a slight difference-  a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very tangible \\\"thunk\\\".  I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage.  My bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such that they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on the lower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a \\\"bank-follower\\\", or a little stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a 100%-banked turn.  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7 mm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for the mystery.  The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I'm fairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread in the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.    Okay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ?  How can you rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) without damaging the thread in the hole ?  Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo that Kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenly changes phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid ?

Finally, the 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up,  became warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I took a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride. They had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours before I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom -- surrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.  Today was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes, 50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat Touring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot. Some sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one MSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on the back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that Cycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like a big moto party.  After about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime, and another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/ pray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the parking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from  the Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else into the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the  ST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of the road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a bicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.  Well I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could  think was \\\"big\\\".  Then I put one foot up.  \\\"Heavy\\\" came to mind very quickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to  tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.  By 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even on bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that  did not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is on a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north of the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95 splits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access highway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton,  Manchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester. On its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about 30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many thoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.  Cindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along in top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane  changes were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this  thing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the fairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was non-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless. Smooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of, but it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless buzz.  The jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the brakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius, decreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.   The section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok in this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack oft featured in \\\"Spencer for Hire\\\" -- a place where you could really  find \\\"Spencer\\\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting through traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.  About half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal for \\\"hold on tight\\\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second gear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a  short shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light traffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new. Well, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort lane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went  until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed there.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering,  I looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.  Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \\\"get off in a mile\\\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted to re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were several manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the  slow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could  see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed to thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad out front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put the thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side stand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.   My demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable, hardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than  list, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.\",\"Dbase IV, ver 1.5, 3.5 disks.  Manuals still shrinkwrapped, and all  registration materials present.

Virtually, Philippe\",\"  Actually the reasons you don't see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are 1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller than nuclear plants.  300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many fossil plants were built.  The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted (\\\"why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go.\\\").   3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.    Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the  heat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is normally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because  moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine  low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best.    A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the condenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the  condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too  hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs.    The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower  they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120  degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer, operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order  to provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area.  At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical \\\"95-95\\\" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East. It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure.   True.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard  stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves. The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water.  By \\\"impure\\\", I mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved oxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will  find outside the laboratory.  John\",\"Has anybody made a converter from irit's .irt or .dat format to  .pov format ?

Khomeini put a  price on the head of someone in another country, this makes him a jerk as well as an international outlaw. Khomeini advocates the view that there was a series of twelve Islamic leaders (the Twelve Imams) who are free of error or sin. This makes him a heretic. In the Qur'an  Muhammad is chastised for error directly by God; the Qur'an says that Muhammad is the greatest example of proper Islamic behavior; thus no muslim is free from error.     Perhaps it seems so to you, but this is hardly the case. There is widespread agreement about matters of Islam. There certainly are many viewpoints on issues which are not particularly Islamic in and of themselves, but this is so for any large group of people under the same name.    The Qur'an is not particularly imprecise in wording, though it is true that several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of many words. However, as an entire text the Qur'an makes its meanings precise enough for intelligent people free from power lust to come to agreement about them.   \",\" Another word (offense) makes them my pick for last too.

PC World, December 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money. I can email you copies of these articles if you can't find them at your library.  I've been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have several friends who use Quicken, though I've not used it myself.  My overall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager while Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your finances.  Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:   The ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:  checking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile  your account statements with the records the program keeps.   The ability to make a budget and track your spending against that  budget.   A Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill  paying service to pay your bills via your modem.    The ability to print checks on your printer.   The ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.   The ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts  up to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically  via modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I'm not sure about it.   The ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation  programs.   Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that Quicken does not:   A tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to  predict your tax liability for the coming year.  It's usefull to fine  tune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn't get his due too early.   An insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep  records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.  It can also compute your life expectancy.   A financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest,   effects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to  maturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and  loan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you   decide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford  a particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good  investment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether  a particular investment's cash flow is adequate for your situation.  This module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping  your kids with their tuition.     A net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets  and liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this   information.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules  are automatically included here.   A \\\"desk\\\" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file  you can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital  information about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a  rudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment  list, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to  track such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list  can be made to display automatically when you start the program.  There are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I'm almost sure that Quicken doesn't do everything I've listed.  If I'm wrong, I'm sure hordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.  One thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a  Windows version.  MECA software is rumored to be working on a Windows version of Managing Your Money for release late this year.\",\" First by his fruits.  The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peace based on Godism.  The messiah's teachings will build on the foundation of the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God, the fall of man, the purpose of creation, and God's providence of restoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the World's religions.  Many Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they may miss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000 years ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewish people of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said that John the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)  Later in prison John even questioned who Jesus was: \\\"is he the one who is to come or do we look for another\\\". (see book of Matthew)   David Koresh didn't even come close.  The problem is that people like this make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real Messiah when he does show up.   Very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for Christians: How to recognize the Second Coming?  The Messiah should not claim to be God.  What sets a Messiah apart is that he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect but achieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were born sinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take God thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God originally intended.  God's restoration providence is still not complete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, God's representative on the earth, but not God himself.  There is only one God.  ...    Who else in this world is claiming to be the Messiah.  Maybe he's already here.\",\"I missed the original post, but aren't the Expos rushing alomost their entire team this year?

Without delving into a deep discussion of : >>creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code : >>perfect and without flaw.  : >  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~  Do you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and has degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement, shouldn't we?  Perhaps the biggest \\\"imperfection\\\" of the code is that it is full of non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains.  Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that intron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes.   On the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted later, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused, if introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated, since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are conserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and these are not found in or near intron sequences.   I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting \\\"theological arguments\\\" like this.  Try Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish & Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.  : Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does : God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a : theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely : scientific perspective, just different.  Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas  theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.   : I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect, : but that doesn't mean it's perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.  For the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support your assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective, unless you support it by some evidence.  In fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we've thought - for instance, sex might have evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by computer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.)    : Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma : rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.  In fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action.   : Actually, neither of us \\\"knows\\\" what the atmosphere was like at the : time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most : biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after : all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth : was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I : seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for : the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?  I'd replace \\\"created\\\" with \\\"formed\\\", since there is no need to  invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one. Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8 billion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but organic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years. This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve.

Although the forces of : >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the : >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.    Again, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for this supposed \\\"degeneration\\\"?

I hope you don't forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests  everything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against this conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in  anything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the  right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so, and not to present one's own conclusions prior to this.   Theology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions.  : >>Human DNA, being more \\\"complex\\\", tends to accumulate errors adversely : >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the  : >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in  : >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence : >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial : >>diseases/disorders.  You are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators from degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to  survive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it  to the present.   And for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection, and thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for either claim.   : But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in : answering John's question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases, : and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require : babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God's fault? (the original : question) -- I say no, it is not.  Of course, nothing \\\"evil\\\" is god's fault.  But your explanation does not work, it fails miserably.   : You may be right.  But the fact is that you don't know that : Satan is not responsible, and neither do I. :  : Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it : be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills : that affect mankind?  I don't think so.  He could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is, it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution.  : Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference. : Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the : point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I : never said that people are \\\"meant\\\" (presumably by God) \\\"to be : punished by getting diseases\\\".  Why I did say is that free moral : choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject : God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not : expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic : universe.  I am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone. I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer is not as clear-cut as it seems to be.  What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?    : Oh, I admit it's not perfect (yet).  But I'm working on it.  :)  A good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.  : What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the : question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are : fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain : *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don't explain : the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.  Why is there a \\\"why behind\\\"? And your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend these books.  Is there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence for this? If the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al) suggest, why do people still insist on this?   : Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am : not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details : of biology and genetics, although I'm sure I'd find it a : fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do : not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the : beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its : environment.  I'm sorry, but they do.

Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on NHL teams have escalated to the following stats:  Canadians: 400 Americans: 100 Europeans: 100     Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top 25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.     Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like \\\"Bure\\\" \\\"Konstantinov\\\" and \\\"Borshevshky\\\". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec, and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other teams is getting worse as well.       I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about \\\"Pavel Bure, the Russian Rocket\\\" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a Canucks fan to begin with ;-).       Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and some Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even better hockey players. It's all hype. This \\\"European mystique\\\" is sickening, but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.      With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly only getting worse.

Box 605  Amherst, NY 14226-0605       COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTH-IMPACTING ASTEROIDS      Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula, based on     studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests.         (1/3.4)     D = S  S  c  K  W     : crater diameter in km   g  p  f  n          (1/6)     S = (g /g )      : gravity correction factor for bodies other than      g   e  t        Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g is the surface          e        t          gravity of the target body. This scaling is          cited for lunar craters and may hold true for          other bodies.    (1/3.4)     S = (p / p )     : correction factor for target density p  ,      p   a   t           t          p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U           a          crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average          rock on the continental shields.      C       : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km          in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth).             (1/3.4)     K       : .074 km / (kT TNT equivalent)      n         empirically determined from the Jangle U          nuclear test crater.         3     2         19     W = pi * d * delta * V  / (12 * 4.185 * 10  )        : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent          given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile          density delta in CGS units. delta of around 3          g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid.      An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing     asteroids.      Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor     Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in     diameter.      More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, 1985):      Asteroid     Number of objects  Impact probability  Impact energy     diameter (km)         (impacts/year)    (* 5*10^20 ergs)       10       10       10^-8  10^9       1    1 000       10^-6  10^6       0.1        100 000       10^-4  10^3      assuming simple scaling laws. Note that 5*10^20 ergs = 13 000 tons TNT     equivalent, or the energy released by the Hiroshima A-bomb.      References:      Gehrels, T. 1985 Asteroids and comets. _Physics Today_ 38, 32-41.

The latter was written with     simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind     (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).      More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John     Snyder's USGS publication \\\"Map Projections--A Working Manual\\\", USGS     Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32     projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both     spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a     neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.      You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,     \\\"An Album of Map Projections\\\", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This     contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are     in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.      You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:     Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National     Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and     tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.      A much faster way (about 1 week) is through Timely Discount Topos,     (303)-469-5022, 9769 W. 119th Drive, Suite 9, Broomfield, CO 80021. Call     them and tell them what you want. They'll quote a price, you send a     check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up     for you. Add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping.

We have several Network General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on several hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy,  2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility, 4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely operated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual  manipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found  it 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for many protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle TCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily modified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems by adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.  Tcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and SunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump. It compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will need Motif 1.1 or better.  The following files are available for anonymous ftp from  ftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking  tcpview-1.0.tar.Z tcpview and tcpdump source code tcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z Sun4 binaries tcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z DEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries  What tcpview adds to tcpdump: - easier interface - enhanced protocol decoding - hex display of frame - capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt - can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name - ethernet address host table - can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames - can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional  processing.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1  New features:  Now reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r', the  file type will be automatically detected.  Can now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file.  The hex format has been changed.  New time options have been added.  Options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets.  Bugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag)  New flags: -R read Sniffer file.  Not usually needed, except for reading from stdin -ttt prints delta times -tttt prints times relative to the first frame -W write a Sniffer save file (use with -w) -x print frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.

I've been using the standard Windows VGA driver with other similarly configured computers.  I am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's screen.  The problem is that once Windows has been envoked, the colors start changing themselves.  At first I thought it was hardware, but if you open a full screen DOS program from within the Windows session, you don't have any problems until you get back to Windows - however, when you initially return to Windows, the original colors get refreshed properly.  Also, it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire, the design on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc.  The color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purple-ish black.  If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - the screen gets refreshed again.  If I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novell network, everything is fine.  I originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine I had just finished configuring, then from the net to this machine.  When I ran into problems, I deleted everything on this machine and the net, and tried bouncing it again.  When that didn't work, I tried reloading Windows to no avail.  Any thoughts on things to check out?  I am totally baffled!  Thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction!\",\"I recently backed out of purchasing an almost-unused Sony TCD-D3 DAT Walkman, having found someone else who has a unit I personally prefer (and am paying more for).  However, it's still a heck of a machine for the price -- it is quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It's probably the most popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)          Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), and here's what he told me:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Here is what is included:         - TCD-D3 DATman.         - (2) RCA to Stereo 1/8\\\" plug cables.  One for analog input, one for           analog output.         - Optical digital I/O cable (one lead for input, one for output).         - A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase.  The           unit is still under factory warrantee.         - AC adaptor/battery charger.         - Rechargable battery.  I paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don't mind if I keep the 60 minute tape it came with (I have some samples on it!).  [By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he's including an  extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about  $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5  years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------          I'm not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice. Send him mail and ask him what he wants.          Again, I've used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainly understand why it is as popular as it is.  I've been using one for a little while, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also point out that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and had truly been _used_ during that time.  (This is the same exact DAT machine that was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy for their recent live album.)  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels in S.F who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reported problem.  My problem is that everyone I know already has one. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------          'nuff said.          The reason I'm not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a unit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don't have any optical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has some other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn't.  (I am also paying more for the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are available if you absolutely must have one.          Of course, it has SCMS.  All consumer decks do.

The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin   e. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.  Your perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.  Similarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.\",\" Not entirely.

It (this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.  WHAT'S NEW ---------- I am now running a World Wide Web archive of RIPEM information.  It does not contain much of anything that isn't available elsewhere, but it has convenient pointers to the most current version of this FAQ and some other stuff.  The URL is \\\"http://cs.indiana.edu/ripem/dir.html\\\".  This month's version has a fair amount of new pointers to information on patents and stuff like that.  I've also reordered a few things to have a more sensible ordering.  I hope I don't have to edit this again soon. :-)  DISCLAIMER ---------- Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything other than one layperson's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk to a real lawyer, preferably one with experience in patent law, export regulations, or whatever area of law is in question.  LIST OF QUESTIONS ----------------- 1)  What is RIPEM? 2)  How can I get RIPEM? 3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine? 4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer? 5)  What is RSA? 6)  What is DES? 7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5? 8)  What is PEM? 9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys? 10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM? 11)  What about RSADSI/PKP? 12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar? 13)  What is PGP? 14)  What about RPEM? 15)  What is MIME? 16)  What is TIS/PEM? 17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ---------------------  1)  What is RIPEM?   RIPEM is a (not yet complete, but useful) implementation of Privacy  Enhanced Mail (PEM).  RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the  four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection  (optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and  non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: \\\"What is PEM?\\\")   RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.  Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,  which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.   The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the  Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7.  2)  How can I get RIPEM?   RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is  considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution  to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or  Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained  (nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were  shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something  weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may  change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the  README file that this law not be violated:   #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution  #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,  #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.   Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is  included with the distribution.  You should read it before using  RIPEM.   RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent  residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README  file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a  product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping  distribute it.   RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \\\"home site\\\" on  ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the  U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out  how to obtain access, FTP there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file  GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are  available here in addition to the full source tree.  3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?   Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of  Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to  Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice  Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports  are expected, and help of users is invited.  4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?   Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend  on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users  guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM  with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.  Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU  Emacs.   If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one  in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,  and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.  5)  What is RSA?   RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means  that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to  decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,  you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your  decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public  key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to  decrypt it.  Note that the \\\"message\\\" sent with RSA is normally just  the DES key to the real plaintext. (See \\\"What is DES?\\\")   Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For  originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of  origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message  (See \\\"What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\\\") is encrypted with the  sender's private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving  authority, can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm  that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered.   RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who  invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography  in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information  also may be in sci.crypt.  6)  What is DES?   DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or  secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to  encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.   RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts  your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the  recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,  allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.   DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a  key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it  should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large  corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM  standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the  near future, because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be  stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with  interoperability.  7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?   MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.  It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,  of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not  possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a  different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,  instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,  only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.   MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example,  RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so  parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate  channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy.   MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often  used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a  passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.   MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in  RFC 1321.   There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong  a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash  function will be used if this is accepted as true.  8)  What is PEM?   PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of  encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a  working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these  documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.   RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM  specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not  handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.  9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?   For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know  your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message  received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important  that this information be accurate; if a \\\"bad guy\\\" convinces her that  his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.   RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,  the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are  described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.  None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for  key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM  is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist.  10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?   This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310,  the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section  6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be  met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421  addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key  cryptography.   This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that  everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of  patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key  cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive  (available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter  and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are  compressed with a patented algorithm.)  11)  What about RSADSI/PKP?   RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company  specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a  firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S.  patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents:        Cryptographic Apparatus and Method       (\\\"Diffie-Hellman\\\")............................... No. 4,200,770        Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus       and Method (\\\"Hellman-Merkle\\\").................... No. 4,218,582        Cryptographic Communications System and       Method (\\\"RSA\\\")................................... No. 4,405,829        Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus       and Method (\\\"Hellman-Pohlig\\\").................... No. 4,424,414   PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key  cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for  example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.)  PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of  companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in their  products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their  patents.   RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than  its use of the RSAREF library, and for no reason other than its  author's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography.  However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got  interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site, and some  people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing  code.  RIPEM even won the \\\"Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992\\\"  award.  12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?   RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography  Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the  key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as  those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys  are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were  generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.  13)  What is PGP?   PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.  PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.  PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.   A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM:   - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without    a direct network connection.   - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability    of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be    compatible with anything other than itself.   - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which    comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own    implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its    patents to \\\"make, use or sell\\\" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without    either a license or written permission.  (See: \\\"DISCLAIMER\\\")    (See: \\\"What about RSADSI/PKP?\\\")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of    PGP, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal    action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but    it hasn't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening    in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User's Guide:     #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency,     #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public    #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is    #contraband.   - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside    the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However, PGP    already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places.   Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is  recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.  Unfortunately, it's not distributed separately from the program,  which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to  liability concerns.  14)  What about RPEM?   RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,  but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in  an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was  written by Mark Riordan, who later wrote RIPEM.   Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many  (including Rabin), PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough  to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally  accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons.   RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.  15)  What is MIME?   MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is  described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup  comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM should interact with  MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution  of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM  messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft  Internet documents exist on the matter.  16)  What is TIS/PEM?   Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy  Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard, it was  rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (MH)  rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test.  I don't know  much more than that.  17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\",\":  : >> Please enlighten me.

Sorry about that.  #8 LARRY DEPALMA  Season: 3rd Acquired: '91-92, free agent from Minnesota Grade:  I (C-/D+)  No netter/fan watching the Sharks, including me, knows where DePalma was at the end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights, but he wasn't in San Jose, he wasn't in Kansas City, and his name hasn't appeared on the waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning, DePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good defense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of the way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to Kansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks officials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.  #10 JOHAN GARPENLOV  Season: 3rd Acquired: '91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round   pick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver Grade:  A/A-  After an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the team, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob Gaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in the MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power- play goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite his small size (5' 11\\\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around when necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work on his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will be a major key to the offense next year.  #15 DAVID BRUCE  Season: 5th Acquired: '91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft Grade:  I (?)  After a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and was third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the lineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame, because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his future with the Sharks next season appears clouded.  #18 MARK PEDERSON  Season: 3rd Acquired: '92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud Grade:  I (B)  It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson, after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but after riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the Sharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with 41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by injuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when healthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size (and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a physical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability on defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much, exactly, Pederson can do.  #20 JOHN CARTER  Season: 4th Acquired: '91-92, free agent from Boston Grade:  I (B+/B)  Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard work worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he did look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55 games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about 20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always hussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end, but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress offensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He is very unlikely to be back next season.  #28 JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (B+/B)  I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the 14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating opportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL duty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those 14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training camp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the Sharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season.  #41 MARK BEAUFAIT  Season: 1st Acquired: 2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft Grade:  I (?)  After a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the Sharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the Sharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only NHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9\\\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times, although it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played mostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and Kansas City.  #42 JAROSLAV OTEVREL Season: 1st Acquired: 8th round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade:  I (?)  Like Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally very much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either, although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those 7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his defense is acceptable, he should be ready.  #44 MICHEL PICARD  Season: 1st Acquired: '92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau Grade:  I (B-/C+)  The 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to be close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the Sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for his only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City. He was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although he has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the expansion draft.  #45 DODY WOOD  Season: 1st Acquired: 3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade:  I (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)  I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably no surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although 13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was not particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games, projecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at least another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if nothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11\\\", 181 lbs.) does not give much possibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.\",\" Please do...and let us know specifics.

The scenario you outline is reasonably  consistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does not support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by latest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for about 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at most) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before there were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease... mostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just fossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what brought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then how could it exist before humans?  [deletions]   Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about biology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There is no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off' in perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a collective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the degeneration of the genetic code'.    Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But it still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as much damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even when people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed', (forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and died off for lack of nearby hosts.  I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few hundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to be getting less nasty w/age...    Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right? And, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It seems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift humans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less lethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems, imperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us by God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made our immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases?    Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the phrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect' system would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system that will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a perfect system. At least, IMHO.  Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the original genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart? If so, why could God not have used better materials?  Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself, of did It just choose not to?  [deletions]   My main point, as I said, was that there really isn't any evidence for the explanation you give. (At least, that I'm aware of.)

And does anyone who knows more Particle physics then me,  know if the IPNS could Prove this technology? \",\"THE WHITE HOUSE                      Office of the Press Secretary ______________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                             April 13, 1993                                    REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT,                SECRETARY OF EDUCATION RICHARD RILEY AND                    SECRETARY OF LABOR ROBERT REICH  IN                  GOALS 2000 SATELLITE TOWN HALL MEETING                             Chamber of Commerce Building                            Washington, D.C.       8:30 P.M. EDT                     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you  in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking  part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.              You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas  Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to  mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he  has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all  followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education  here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according  to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational  system.              His philosophy of government, his belief in the  importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest  here this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us  President Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in  the Chamber of Commerce studios.                Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for  taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite  network and we welcome you here this evening.              Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.   And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening  also.              I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure  many of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that  you'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In  Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.              I believe the President has a few words that he might  want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that  at this time.  It's great to have you.              THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.              I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob  Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the  Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making,  along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine  tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people  from school to the work place.              I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts,  recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this  economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to  work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to  make things happen.              This satellite town meeting is a good example of that  kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home  state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart  Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing  several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I  appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all  the rest of you.              I have tried as hard as I could to move toward  constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about  this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson  believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in  education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion,  freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and  third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.                If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this  beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful  cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change  with changing times.              For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit  and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we  can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight -- about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless  we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in  government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase  our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the  long run.              We also have to have people who can carry their load.   And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven  or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system  and continues into the work force where education must go on for a  lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can  learn.              And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing  we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership  between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the  private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're  trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that  would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many  thousands that have a strong education component so our young people  can be learning and working at the same time.              Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good  place we can begin, I think, the discussion.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.              Each month we get together and talk about ways that all  citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And  tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours  can prepare students for this world of work.              This week, the Education Department and the Labor  Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called  Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.   The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's  proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched  jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged  areas of the country.                Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it  somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls  for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your  words is that so important?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.   First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may  have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want  them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to  continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of  research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may  forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year  over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for  schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already  taught before.              Secondly, we want to help these young people progress,  not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to  abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is  learning because we think that the best and most productive workers  will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience  could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to  succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are  disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go  into the next year, is really even greater.                Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs  throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this  educational component of training.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr.  Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer  or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with  education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people,  for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning  geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or  working on something, and they can see the exact and direct  application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a  lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between  education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.   It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of  young people even beyond the summer.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.                Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship  program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell  us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it  developing.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why  it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade  will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will  require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people  get in a high school diploma.                If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries  of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school  education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young  people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not  go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because  they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their  employers.              So we think America has a big economic interest in  trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school  but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes  two years of further training either in a community college, a  vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in  this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some  funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states  and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in  a way that would be customized essentially by the business community,  based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could  revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and  the earnings of American workers.              SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think  you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the  people watching this program -- that the business community and  educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many  of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In  fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The  people watching this program probably are the ones who are most  directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley  and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes  already out there.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight  about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning   career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal  with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of  these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and  you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much  longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business  community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're  doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The  Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these  kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've  aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.              The business community is going to be actively engaged  in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and  helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions  develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.              Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is  one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these  players in a community come together and work together and cooperate  together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and  the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody  is talking, but they're not really working together in a common  strategy.              And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick,  would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic  excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a  tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to  make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be  eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year  college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're  talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation  skills for on-the-job learning.              And again, those are the critical components.  It's  already being done.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one  point based on my personal experience at home -- the business  community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are  the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught,  but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort  of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are  going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the  second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and  influence them.  So I think that's very important.              And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at  the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some  funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make  sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the  quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to  determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.              SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of  course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery  program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about  long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr.  President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the  communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be  coming forth before too long.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I  were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public  schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that  a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.                I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals  that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President  Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to  do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in  Congress that will actually define the things that the national  government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the  children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those  goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school  ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school  graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are  confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are  second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe,  disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took  them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of  life-long learning in this country.              And each one of those goals there's a national role, a  state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector  role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to  introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is;  and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job  is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality  that we need to meet.              It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite  like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.   Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their  money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and  partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really  it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms  of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to  support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform  efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.              Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to  the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of  course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and  I wonder if you would comment on that.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of  our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they  don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system  of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had  national skill standards to which they could aspire and which  employers would understand as a national credential, many of these  young people would actually find that they were much more eligible  for jobs.              Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other  countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to  college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain  technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If  you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to  develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working  with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private  industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the  kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other  institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go  ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce  Todd of Austin, Texas.              Q   Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and  Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We  have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who  have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me  simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with  much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are  very supportive.                We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our  summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to  have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much  as 3,500 with the federal assistance.                Much of the question that we had designed you have  answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But  the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day  would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round  is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal  level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year- round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the  local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's  something that we believe is very important to success in this  effort.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to  answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling,  and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.   I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.                First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can  structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer  program and that will move a lot of these young people back into  schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in  the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to  try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs  to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're  working on that.              Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the  Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to  build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job  training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give  heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you  asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we  hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being  trained on a year-round basis.              And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said  a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen  as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people  actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when  they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we  hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and  we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget  cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue  raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be  able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.              Bob, do you want to say anything?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out  of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing,  and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high  school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in  addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of  jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.   It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the  economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything  else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I  think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I  think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or  greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going  to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything  right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000  will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into  next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it  will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working  together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And  then the state, with all the various school districts, a very  important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I  think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that  moving.              The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.                Doctor?              Q   Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to  be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school  and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since  its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two  alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages  we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an  extremely effective learning strategy.              And over the years, we've come to believe that there are  several principles that are very important in bridging the school and  work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with  practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure  to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect  upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and  lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the  development of high performance competencies.                My question, then is:  How can the general education  faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with  transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies  can you suggest to achieve this integration?              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think --  and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting  work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next  guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists    in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to  them and we can discuss it later.              You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?              THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one  thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as  clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the  people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more  explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics  is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish  what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is  vocational learning and what is academic learning.              I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think  we should have a strong component for people who are in the  vocational program.              SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to  rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and  work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're  important for all students.  It's not just a special group of  students that needs them.              Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United  States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream  experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and  12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience  and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on  to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they  can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and  career directions.              But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often  goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work- related work within the classroom, within our schools.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's  going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I  think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank  you and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and  your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \",\"UPI Clarinet has just relayed a \\\"scoop\\\" from the Toronto Sun (or was that Star?

At least, Marvin's friend has not been able to : locate one and neither have I.  What is the fundamental reason for : this?  I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages (I'm sure I've seen them advertised occassionally), but I think that the main problem is that they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother.  (Of course, it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because no one buys them because they are so expensive...)  NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing (I have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments???) so there is no problem building an expansion box.  The difference between NuBus and PDS is that NuBus is a clever interface with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work together on the same computer. PDS (processor direct slot) is just that: here are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything with this and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation. You may be able to get double PDS slot adaptors but you try plugging 2 video cards in, and just watch them conflict! Of course, the extra  electronics in a NuBus slot makes it appreciably more expensive, so guess why Apple doesn't put it in it's cheaper machines?

It seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment, will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it is a part of it.     Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them within their borders?    [...]  You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade? Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes she had, however, is  the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians are attacking Azeri  towns.  Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  going to cause incessant skirmishes.  Think of 10 or 20 years down the  line -- both of the newly independent countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe the other out.  These people will be neighbors, would it not be better to keep the bad blood between them minimal?  If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of their blood and future.  It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate  as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading inflammatory half-truths.  cheers,\",\" Using XPutImage, your source is maintained by the client and the destination is maintained by the server, thus you incur the overhead of transporting through whatever client-server communications mechanism you are using.

I will argue that your latter statement, \\\"I believe that no gods exist\\\" does rest upon faith - that is, if you are making a POSITIVE statement  that \\\"no gods exist\\\" (strong atheism) rather than merely saying I don't   know and therefore don't believe in them and don't NOT believe in then (weak atheism). Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying   I BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even  after reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.  But first let me say the following. We might have a language problem here - in regards to \\\"faith\\\" and \\\"existence\\\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist. To exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE being - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not exist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it's rather pointless to debate the so called \\\"existence\\\" of God - and that is not what I'm doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of being. When you say that \\\"god does not exist\\\", I also accept this statement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However, in what follows I will use the phrase \\\"the existence of God\\\" in it's 'usual sense' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it. I would like a clarification upon what you mean by \\\"the existence of God\\\".   We also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what  faith  1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY b  (1): fidelity to one's promises    (2): sincerity of intentions 2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God    (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    (2): complete trust 3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ of religious beliefs syn see BELIEF    One can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say that you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion \\\"based upon observation\\\", I will have to ask \\\"what observtions are you refering to?\\\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations can only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even be predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes  partents \\\"believe in God\\\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion about the \\\"existence\\\" or \\\"non-existence\\\" of God requires a leap - and you have made this leap when you actively say \\\"I believe that God   does/does not exist\\\". Personally, I think that both statements are misguided. Arguing over the \\\"existence\\\" of God is precisely the wrong way to find Him (and yes, I use \\\"Him\\\" because a personal God is the only  viable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \\\"She\\\" go ahead. Of course  God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to  anthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I'll be  glad to.)     And please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently  disagree - it's in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person  thinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think  I have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my  ways and I correct the situation.

Mitra is Sanskrit for Friend, as such He started out as an avatar of Lord Visnu  mentioned first in the Vedas. Later he seems to have risen to chief prominence  worshipped by the Persians. Associated with the Sun but NOT the Sun, he is  the lord of contract honor and obedience, therefore naturally worshipped by  soldiers. He was ordered by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and He reluct-  antly agreed because of His obligation...the blood of that bull spilled and  grew all earth life...then Mitra and the Sun sat down to eat.  Worship of Lord Mitra ended in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians.  Hundreds of years later He was rediscovered and thrown into the Official Roman  Pantheon (tm) for some semi-tricky reason, I forget why. But all references of  Him ended abruptly when He was stricken from same, so apparently His worship  was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy, like membership  in the Communist Party was in the Soviet Bloc. The sociology of religion in  ancient times is fascinating!  Oh, His B-day was 25 Dec. Ahem.  I am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after His was booted from the  Roman Imperial God Roster or what. It contained mostly soldiers, with 7 levels  of initiation. They worshipped underground in caverns in pews. The bull horns  in those temples were for scaring away or impaling evil spirits, I'm not sure  that they had Mithraic significance or not.  I don't know that the ritual meal was of a cannibalistic nature as is the  Christian masses. But eating deities goes way back to Old Kingdom Egypt.  Someone mentioned bullfighting. Did Mithraists sacrifice bulls? I forget. More  likely, for a religious source, might be the shower of bull's blood enjoyed  by the worshippers of Cybele on the Day of Blood? Cybele worship extended all  throughout even up to France bigtime.\",\"Actually, many of us have noted this.

Just can't tell you how excited I was when the Islanders beat the Rangers in overtime on last Friday!!!\",\"'lo all,    I am writting a program that checks a computer for its configuration. It's going to be run everytime a computer boots up to our campus network.  (Actually, it already is running, it's just not getting all the info I want it to yet...)  Anyway, I want to check for a mouse.  I already check for a mouse driver (using the code in Microsoft's Mouse book).  But there is no guarantee that the driver is loaded when my program runs, or that they ever load the driver.    Since I am interested in what hardware is attached to the machine, how do I detect is a mouse is attached?  I know it can be done because the mouse driver can do it.    Thanks in advance,  Andy  \",\"#The better question  should be. #Why not transfer  O&M of all birds to a separate agency with continous funding #to support these kind of ongoing science missions.  Since we don't have the money to keep them going now, how will changing them to a seperate agency help anything? \",\" Gee, what do I do?  My LDL is only 50-60. (and my HDL is only 23-25) I must be risking something, but Is it the same risk as those with  very high LDL?   What about exercise and a low-fat diet?  What are the long-term  effects of this drug? \",\"    I don't think that this is accurate. I believe, and could be wrong, that there IS a specific right allegedly to have been violated, like the 14th or due process or whatever.   Double jeopardy does not apply, but not for the reasons you quote. Double jeopardy states that a person may not be tried twice on the same charge. However, the police are not on trial for the crime of excessive force or assault. They are NOW on trial for the DIFFERENT crime of violating Mr. King's civil rights.   AS for the city and county or state trying you more than once,  it most likely will not happen. This is because cities and states have separate laws governing behaviour. For example, in some states, it is an offence to carry marijuana, but not a city offence. Also, I think murder is against federal, but not some state laws. \",\" 1. There is a similar idea here in ex-USSR about how many militioners it needs    to place a new electric lamp. The answer is nine: one stays on a table and    holds the lamp, four hold the table and turn it and yet four run around the    table in opposite direction not to make the first feel bad (when being    turned). Pitily, it lacks this kind of dark humour as Nick's msg does. 2. To my mind the signature should be smth like:                    /       _                     __        /  .                 /_______/_/_______________    /________ /____/          /___ /      _                  /                                            Albert \",\"  The PC World reviewers found out that the Herc people had hard-coded Winbench text into the driver.

It comes with instruction for installation and requires no soldering.  Worked like a charm.

I limit myself to *one* 'standard serving' of alcohol if I'm going to ride. And mostly, unless the alcohol is something special (fine ale, good wine, or someone else's vsop), I usually just don't drink *any*.  But then alcohol just isn't really important to me, mainly for financial reasons...  At least one of the magazines claims to follow the aviation guideline of \\\"no alcohol whatsoever\\\" within 24hrs of riding a 'company' bike.
