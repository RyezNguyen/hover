Do people forget that the IDE was specifically designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen IDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all times it was a 16 bit standard, running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When you run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running it at 33 Mhz, it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever, none of them run at CPU speed.  The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to a caching controller. I suspect it would be much, much better to get a software disk cache instead, since you get write-caching as well.   I've seen some Fuji IDE drives going as high as 1G.\",\" The documentary interviewed Koresh and current and ex-members.   The documentary disucussed Koresh's \\\"Christ\\\" status inside the cult,  cult brain-washing techniques, and unusual sex practices (the leader  gets any he wants, and tells others when they can or can't).  I will let  others decide if using religious authority to have sex with a minor is  technically child abuse or not.   All true.   Well, if a fire was deliberately set by members of the cult, then the  history and background of the cult is very relevant.  The history  and backgournd of the Jones cult was very important in understanding  what happened at Jonestown.  Not taking into account the history and background of Koresh's cult may  also help explain why the FBI and BATF so badly predicted the reponses  they would get from inside the compund nearly every step of the way in  this badly handled affair.   It is likely that there will be at least two investigations (JD and congress)  at this point.   Interesting and conflicting details are starting to come out.  I have  reverted back to wait mode to find out whether the fire was intentional  or accidental and how it started and why it spread so fast.   \",\"Can anyone recomend a good book or article on inter-client communications BESIDES I.C.C.M.?

Their engineering tolerances are slack enough that they tend to radiate on different frequencies. Even where they overlap, you can discriminate because they have different line synch frequencies - you can lock in on one and average the others out.  The signals are weird in any case, with varying polarisations and all sorts of interactions with the building.

[...]  Elias should the families of the children who were stabbed in their high school by a Palestinian \\\"freedom fighter\\\" be the ones who offer their help to the Gazans. Perhaps it should be the families of the 18 Israelis who were murdered last month by Palestinian \\\"freedom fighters\\\".  The Jews in the Warsaw ghetto were fighting to keep themselves and their families from being sent to Nazi gas chambers. Groups like Hamas and the Islamic Jihad fight with the expressed purpose of driving all Jews into the sea. Perhaps, we should persuade Jewish people to help these wnderful \\\"freedom fighters\\\" attain this ultimate goal.  Maybe the \\\"freedom fighters\\\" will choose to spare the co-operative Jews.

But unfortunely the Yards (a definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots. Ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost gone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for most of the year like '89).   On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.  Fernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching staff looks pretty good.

In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health insurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like socialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary insurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward. With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.  That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund is to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back in Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \\\"libertarian\\\" faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these).  I'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about leftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian newsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100% insurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't know it, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (American conservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who seriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about the Americans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germans who spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that shouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for insurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that the Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite being open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to spend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a different culture.   \\\"Managed Care\\\" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most western nations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France and Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says of HMO/NHS approaches, \\\"We left that behind with East Germany!\\\"). Sure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling doctors with budget strings.  In Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France and Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public hospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisions are different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked \\\"sickness funds\\\" over a century old while Canada divides by their provinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the doctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)  With such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 to the U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The French and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations in more compact geography to improve scales of economy.  gld\",\"Stolen from Pasadena between 4:30 and 6:30 pm on 4/15.

The fact that there appears to be an abuse in the early Church of people eating too much (a very real concern with some Passover meals) and not treating the meal with respect, shows the simplifying of the ritual to just bread and wine to be a way of dealing with the inherent problems of people's human nature, and trying to keep the essentials of the remembrance aspects.\",\" I have also heard it called an expression of mercy, because Heaven would be far more agonizing for those who had rejected God. \",\" No, the neiseria meningococcus is one of the most common forms of meningitis.  It's the one that sometimes sweeps schools or boot camp.  It is contagious and kills by attacking the covering of the brain, causing the blood vessels to thrombose and the brain to swell up.  It is very treatable if caught in time.  There isn't much time, however.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible to dying from bacterial meningitis.  Any infant with a fever who becomes stiff or lethargic needs to be rushed to a hospital where a spinal tap will show if they have meningitis.  Seizures can also occur.   It can live in the throat of carriers.  Don't worry, you won't get  it from them, especially if they took the medication.  --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\"The Sophomore           (Romans 1:22)  The sophomore says, ``What is truth?'' and turns to bask in the admiration of his peers.  How modern how daring how liberating How modern how daring how liberating they chant  The sophomore, being American Doesn't know That his ``question''     modern        skeptical            cynical  Was asked before, by a     modern        skeptical            cynical    urbane cosmopolitan  Politician (appointed not elected) Who happened to live two thousand years ago.  Like many politicians he cared      Less about ideals          than results      Less about ends          than means      Less about anything          than keeping his job               (and his head).  We might call him A bit brutal Though `firm' would be kinder (And no doubt Stalin, who let nobody go, laughed at his laxness) He didn't like his job; perhaps he no longer hoped for better (Nor feared worse, except regarding his head).  And when these wily Jews With their heads-I-win, tails-you-lose      conundrums Brought forth their madman, His first impulse was to play the Roman: ``I find nothing wrong with him,   See to it yourselves.''  But when they mentioned `King' and `Caesar' His heart froze.  If he killed their madman     He'd start a riot          and lose his job              (and his head)  If he saved the King of the Jews     He'd piss off Caesar          and lose his job              (and his head)  And when his wife told him to have    Nothing to do with the righteous lout She didn't tell him anything    He hadn't already figured out.  So he punted.  ``Not my jurisdiction!  Take him to see Herod!'' (who just happened to be in town....)  Herod appreciated the courtesy But wasn't worried         And sent the sharp-tongued fool      (Who suddenly didn't have much to say,     funny how people lose it under pressure....)   back In the attire proper   to his Royal State.  His ass is covered---if Herod has no problem, Caesar certainly won't.  The fool can be king of whatever world he wants as long as it's not Caesar's.  ``I'm letting him go,'' he said with a shout. (Looks like he'll last this one out....)  The crowd's reaction puzzled him.   They really wanted him dead. They didn't want the King of the Jews,   They wanted Barabbas instead (And, as Josephus records, they got him)  Oh well, he thought, They all look the same to me. And we'll get Barabbas next time.  And if I can get them to say    ``We have no king but Caesar!''    By killing a madman, Hell, I'll kill ten a day.

[]  Define \\\"armed better\\\". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to 3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).  A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.  - A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull   the trigger again. - A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,   but will fire merely by pulling the trigger. - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again   to rotate to the next round. - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the   hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an   easy motion, even one handed. - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines   on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.  - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell   first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often   lost as you realize \\\"hey, it's jammed!\\\" before starting to do anything   about clearing it. - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round   and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the    chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider   this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed   of employment as a revolver. - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of   operation of many of them requires more training.  Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having accidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks require rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a VCR.  Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter and pay attention. I do not seek here to say \\\"semi-autos are junk\\\" merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot.  Gun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a  wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything. Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit. I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit what I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously wrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than 5.  What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple .38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police  prefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....  ObPlea: Don't flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things. But they          introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking         as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal. \",\"Can't guarantee that it'll work for everyone, but I finally fixed my mouse jumpiness problems: I installed a bus mouse.

So much so that my old mouse must have been jumpy all the time (I just thought it was jumpy sometimes), and I had gotten so used to it I didn't notice. My wife, who uses the computer about once a month, noticed the improvement literally within a second!  I can't say anything about other bus mice, but with the Mouse Systems one you'll have to give up either COM2 or LPT2 to an IRQ. Also, if you don't know, Mouse Systems mice have three buttons. The driver includes a utility that lets you assign keystrokes to the middle button.  Hope this helps someone else.

These are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by people around me.  1.      Is it true that the Israeli authorities don't recognize Israeli nationality ? And that ID cards, which Israeli citizens must carry at all times, identify people as Jews or Arabs, not as Israelis ?  2.      Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders and that Israeli governments from 1948 until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of the State of Israel should be ?  3.      Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons ? If so, could you provide any evidence ?  4.      Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets ?  5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied territories are subject to different laws than non-Jews?  6.      Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 1947/48 to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return, while their Christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return ?  7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948, as is done today in Bosnia-Herzegovina ?  8.      Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as members in kibbutzim?  9.      Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage marriages between Jews and non-Jews ?  10.     Is it true that Hotel Hilton in Tel Aviv is built on the site of a muslim cemetery ?  Thanks,\",\"   I agree entirely.  Speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what it's worth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of Christianity.  Although I'm sure it's possible to argue theologically that we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basis of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): the three forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn't discriminate on the basis of sex, race or sexual orientation.  I found the moderator's FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommend everyone to read them.  There seem to be three different levels of acceptance:  1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever) 2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation (though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people who indulge 3) As 2, but \\\"love the sinner\\\" 4) Accept homosexuality altogether.  My experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2 are limited to a few fundamentalist sects).  I suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling that a 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, on discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex, would not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel the pressure not to exhibit their feelings.  I'm not saying that the community (in particular the parents) would not love the child, but I suspect the child would not feel loved.\",\"mjs>Well, there are just as many courses here and elsewhere that do *not* mjs>teach the technique, yet seem to be rather successful...

You just gotta love the standard military tire, too, or at least the one they used to use.

GB> I hope you meant \\\"inarguably\\\".  Given the choice, I would rather argue <g>.  No arguments about migranous aura; in fact, current best evidence is that aura is intrinsicially neuronal (a la spreading depression of Leao) rather than vascular (something causing vasoconstriction and secondary neuronal ischemia).  Migraine without aura, however, is a fuzzier issue.  There do not seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The Copenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF studies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura, but like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.  From one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in the absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From another (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of the specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache, therefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.  Whether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling headaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic colleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients they can get.

It is     disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich    or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed     solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.  I agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc... is not terrorism.

It is NOT a \\\"terrorist camp\\\" as you and the Israelis like     to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer    in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....  I would not argue that all or even most of the villages are \\\"terrorist camps\\\".  There are however some which come very close to serving that purpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way prior to the invasion.      SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of    the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not     know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often    suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are    supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and    ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps    for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured    by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages    of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they    are back they announce that they bombed a \\\"terrorist  hideout\\\" where    an 8 year old girl just happened to be.  Some of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you describe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area, backed by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah and Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation, while mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate bombing, which would have produced major casualties.     Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that    we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance    on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING     ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real     leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.  Well, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if the Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police it and prevent further attacks.     This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to    realize that the concept of a \\\"buffer zone\\\" aimed at protecting    its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more    Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel    would have resulted in.    Actually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no longer civilian and now primarily military though.     There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese    goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such     circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is    capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did    in all other parts of Lebanon.  No, the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another Lebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary.     I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing    CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.  No, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation. \",\"It is appropriate to add what Himmler said other \\\"inferior races\\\"  and \\\"human animals\\\" in his speech at Posen and elsewhere:   From the speech of Reichsfuehrer-SS Himmler, before SS Major-Generals, Posen, October 4 1943 [\\\"Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression\\\", Vol. IV, p. 559] ------------------------------------------------------------------- One basic principal must be the absolute rule for the SS man: we must be honest, decent, loyal, and comradely to members of our own blood and to nobody else. What happens to a Russian, to a Czech, does not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping their children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest to me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as the anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished. We shall never be rough and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans, who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these human animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worry about them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someone comes to me and says, \\\"I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women and children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them\\\", then I would have to say, \\\"you are a murderer of your own blood because if the anti-tank ditch is not dug, German soldiers will die, and they are the sons of German mothers. They are our own blood\\\".    Extract from Himmler's address to party comrades, September 7 1940 [\\\"Trials of Wa Criminals\\\", Vol. IV, p. 1140] ------------------------------------------------------------------ If any Pole has any sexual dealing with a German woman, and by this I mean sexual intercourse, then the man will be hanged right in front of his camp. Then the others will not do it. Besides, provisions will be made that a sufficient number of Polish women and girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this kind is out of the question.  The women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and where the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline cases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp. This we must do, unless these one million Poles and those hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict untold damage on the German blood. Philosophizing is of no avail in this case. It would be better if we did not have them at all - we all know that - but we need them.  \",\"  sorta.

Please email me all offers with a price...\",\"Off and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs and related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can  predict a player's RBIs using information about his overall performance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP) that he bats with.  In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated predicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This  completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2  could do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.  I've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that I've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and b) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits. That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't  have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get   (RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.  The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is significant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the fit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to  the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark, Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to  add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.  It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the low HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it could just be Ozzie.  The results:                             RBI-HR          Years        Actual   Predicted Carter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6 Clark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6 Matt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8 Smith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6  I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.

But there would be no _net_ _positive_ effect. You also have to  consider the negative side: Law abiding citizens, armed with  fireamrs (pistols for the most part), prevent between 80,000 (National Crime Survey) and 1,000,000 (Dr. Kleck) crimes each year. (Those are the extremes. Most studies find the number to be 500,000 to 600,000.) About 1% of those crimes are homicides, so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately 5,000 lives each year. There are roughly 12,000 criminal homicides and fatal accidents involving guns each year. For there to  be any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measures would disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns. That would be very hard to do: According the the federal BATF, only 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Since gun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legal sales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed, law-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on armed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.)  That doesn't sound like a net benefit to me.     Since most were with licensed weapons, I assume you are not supporting \\\"reasonable\\\" laws (i.e. waiting periods, background checks, licenses, etc...). Since only a complete ban would  alter the statistic you refer to, I assume that's what you are supporting.  By the way, 1135 people dies in 1986 from falling down stairs. 250 accidental handgun deaths isn't significant next to  other household accidents.   1080 children under the age of 10 died by drowning, 69 from  drinking poisonous household chemicals (like Drano), 139 from falls. If the real goal is to reduce the tragic, accidental deaths of children, wouldn't a ban on drain cleaners be a  better palce to start? (Or, perhaps, restricting ownership to professionals like plumbers?)   While you might call it \\\"emphasis\\\", refering to completely two statistics in the same sentence _implies_ a comparison.

The Braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description, although right now I'd expect Smoltz or Glavine to take the mantle.   What the Braves lack, however, is an offensive stopper, somebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump. There's just no one there.  The Braves got rid of their best pure hitter, Lonnie Smith, and only Terry Pendleton on the current roster has ever shown more than a cursory ability to hit.    Oh, and another thing that worries me.  Ron Gant seems to have slowed down a step.  That's scary.  A slow Ron Gant doesn't have much going for him.\",\" I have a long sighted eye and a short sighted eye. My right eye tends to cut out when I look at distant things, my left eye when I am close up.

I'd say you're cutting it close. Perhaps if your parents are reasonable, and you indicated your wish to learn to ride safely, you could get them to pick up the cost of the MSF course and some of the safety gear. Early holiday presents or whatever. Those are one-time (well, long-term anyway) investments, and you could spend your money on the actual bike, insurance, registration, and maintenance.\",\"  I recall reading in the recently revised edition of the \\\"Yeast Connection\\\" that there is indeed work by researchers to do this.

Does anyone  know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog  signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.  I'd lay a few bucks that its just data-in-data-out in parallel.  I suspect to make it a phone you'd need a codec and speech compression.  There would be a loss of bandwidth on the speech signal, which I suspect would scupper any of the suggestions I've seen here about putting a different encryption front end on it.  There's no hint of any modulation scheme in the docs.  I'm sure it's purely a digital chip.  The back end will come later, but I'm *positive* it won't be left to the manufacturers - they all have to be the same modulation scheme to make it easy for the NSA to tap them.  The only other possibility is that this is intended only for ISDN phones.

So, she's married to Joseph.  She gets knocked up.  What do you think ol' Joe will do if he finds she's been getting around?

Anyway, she never tells anyone the truth, and even tells poor little Jesus that he's hot shit, the Son of God.  Everyone else tells him this too, since they've bought Mary's story.

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD     On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National  Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D. Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.     OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier. The Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.

It's now 6am... I'm pissed off.  Period.  Alright, I can  drive the steppers through the 3479P's; no problem (that's with the  6-wire steppers, 2 to +, and the other 4 are the phase lines).  Problem  1:  I've got some 4 wire steppers.  I put the darkest line to + and the  other 3 to the 3479P... worked, kinda.  Tried it with a printer stepper  (moves the head back and forth, 4 wires), didn't work too well.  It  would  shift back and forth (use something like a 4017 instead?)

Kings\",\" [deletia- and so on]  I seem to have been rather unclear.  What I was asking is this:  Please show me that the most effective substance-absure recovery programs involve meetinsg peoples' spiritual needs, rather than merely attempting to fill peoples' spiritual needs as percieved by the people, A.A, S.R.C. regulars, or snoopy. This will probably involve defining \\\"spritual needs\\\" (is it not that clear) and showing that such things exist and how they can be filled.  Annother tack you might take is to say that \\\"fulfilling spiritual needs\\\" means \\\"acknowledging a \\\"higher power\\\" of some sort, then show that systems that do require this, work better than otherwise identical systems that do not. A correlation here would help you, but as you point out this might just be demonstrating swapping one crutch for annother. (however, I do feel that religion is usually a better crutch than alchohol, as it is not usually poisonous! :) )  I hope with that clarification, my question will be answerable. I actually did know about the 12 step program, its the question of what it does, rather than what it tries to do, that makes a difference to me. ---    - Dan Johnson And God said \\\"Jeeze, this is dull\\\"... and it *WAS* dull.

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.    Contents:  * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key? * What references can I start with to learn cryptology? * How does one go about cryptanalysis? * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance? * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem? * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice? * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are   relatively easy to break?   * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?    The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted   acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A   by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone   who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.    A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so   that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is   the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art   of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when   you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both   cryptography and cryptanalysis.    The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is   called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert   plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert   ciphertext into plaintext.    A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The   algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,   Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different   values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.    The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are   called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,   eavesdroppers, or third parties.  * What references can I start with to learn cryptology?    For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given   in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,   concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,   these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has   developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and   mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is   encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up   to the mid-60's.    Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or   Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want   to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common   mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.    The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of   many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently   several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The   book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range   of security including encryption algorithms, database security,   access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments   apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].    The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite   technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in   the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of   DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses   of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on   modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management   and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and   networks.    The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on   the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.  * How does one go about cryptanalysis?    Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of   analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern   finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available   textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series   [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for   the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given   systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the   cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still   classified.    Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,   or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare   of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the   most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.  * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?    In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can   find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.    Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding   ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the   plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or   decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.   Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this   brute-force search is impractical.        Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered   practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years   now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with   this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the   mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic   decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel   machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.   Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].    One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a   brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.  * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?    The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key   rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.    A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The   unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of   ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and   if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount   of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is   probably strong.    A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears   random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).        A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A   system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.    If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily   strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.   However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is   strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then   he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring   integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.  * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?    Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical   cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your   ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might   assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is   correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the   rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same   plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus   he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he   doesn't have a chance.    Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,   for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even   chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into   the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See   [KAH67].    * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are   relatively easy to break?\",\"   [Stuff deleted]    I'm glad to see that someone is working on this.  However, it would be nice if he got his units right.\",\"To:All  Hi,  Does anybody have the source code to the externel processes that comes with 3D  Studio, and mabe som kind of DOC for writing the

     Well, my question still hasn't been answered: if Spanky was bad enough to release this year, why did he get so much playing time last year?  Yes, I know he was part of a platoon, and that's why he got more playing time than Slaught, but that doesn't answer the question.  If Slaught was so obviously better this year, wasn't this also obvious last year, and shouldn't he have been taking away some of Spanky's playing time against righties?\",\"I just installed a Motorola XC68882RC50 FPU in an Amiga A2630 board (25 MHz 68030 + 68882 with capability to clock the FPU separately).  Previously a MC68882RC25 was installed and everything was working perfectly.  Now the systems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for the presence/type of FPU.  When I reinstall an MC68882RC25 the system works fine, but with the XC68882 even at 25 MHz it does not work.  The designer of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe (470 Ohm) might help, but that didn't change anything.  Does anybody have some suggestions what I could do?  Does this look like a CPU-FPU communications problem or is the particular chip dead (it is a pull, not new)? Moreover, the place I bought it from is sending me an XC68882RC33.  I thought that the 68882RC33 were labeled MC not XC (for not finalized mask design).  Are there any MC68882RC33?\",\" The Yammie Deltabox and the Hawk frame are conceptually similar but Yammie has a TM on the name. The Hawk is a purer 'twin spar'  frame design: investment castings at steering head and swing arm tied together with aluminum extruded beams.

Even though my skin gets oily it really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry.   Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day vitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it   is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease  on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating meat).  Keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it softens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with oilyness.   Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't be an infection afterwards.  Tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry makes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples).  \",\"    I've got an 89 GT.  It has the smoked taillight assembly.  I think this is where the water is getting in.  When I first got it (had it for a month), one of the rear taillights fogged up with moisture.  I took it in to the dealer and they replaced the entire assembly.  It happened to the other one about 3 months later.  This time I happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there.  The dealer was more reluctant this time to replace it.  But I convinced them to fix it.  (They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the same problem.)  I haven't noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5 years, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again.  I'm going to try to take it back to get them to fix it again.  I'm real tempted to drill some vent and drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it.  This is getting very annoying. (Almost every other `89 GT I've seen has had this problem.)

P. A1.  NEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE   * INQUIRY: Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage    by a man who infiltrated political groups  By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.  SAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world, Roy Bullock was a small-time art dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District.  In reality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40 years.  His code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal, and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) in her Washington, D.C., office.  For a time, Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White Aryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes.  From police sources he obtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people.  And he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government to trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills.  These are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a former Los Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with police and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide intelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League.  Officials of the Anti-Defamation League, while denying any improper activity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation.  They have refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz.  Transcripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents released by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory.  At times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air with laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like \\\"Ironsides\\\" and \\\"Flipper.\\\"  On one occasion, Gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a pro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa, Israel.  Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any ties to Israel, Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him.  Shortly afterward, another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed him.  The court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard, a former CIA agent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League.  Gerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the FBI, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker.  Its contents included passports, driver's licenses and identification cards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for four American embassies in Central America; and a collection of blank birth certificates, Army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies.  Also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, a black hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos of blindfolded and chained men.  Investigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the ADL confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of one target group, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee.  Each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony, San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant.  The Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civil rights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. The ADL's fact-finding division, headed by Irwinn Suall in New York, enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists.   However, evidence seized from Bullock's computer shows he kept files on at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Earth Island Institute, the United Farm Workers, Jews for Jesus, Mother Jones magazine, the Center for Investigative Reporting, the Bo Gritz for President Committee, the Asian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP.  The computer files also included information on several members of Congress, including Pelosi, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey from the Bay Area.  In their statements, Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation League has collected information on political activists in the Los Angeles area for more than 30 years.  They said they worked closely with three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who specialized in intelligence work, a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism expert and a San Diego County Sheriff's Department intelligence officer.  A spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation, and the San Diego Sheriff's Department declined comment.  Bullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama.  Although he is not Jewish, he began working undercover as a volunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party.  Bullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by the ADL as an intelligence operative, he told authorities.  In the mid-1970s, he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the West Coast.  To keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneled through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has never missed a payment in more than 32 years, Bullock said.  \\\"I was an investigator for the ADL.  I investigated any and all anti-democratic movements,\\\" Bullock said.  \\\". . . Officially, I'm only a contract worker with Bruce Hochman.  That way, the league would not be officially connected with me.\\\"  Bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists to Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own name but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink.  \\\"I'm one of a kind,\\\" he told police.  In recent years, however, his ADL affiliation has increasingly become known, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him.  In the mid-1980s, he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police.  In part because of this investigation, he became close friends with Gerard, who at the time was working in the San Francisco police intelligence division.  Bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups.  An FBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group:  \\\"Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, and would share the reports with Gerard.  Bullock also gave the trash to Gerard for Gerard to examine.  Gerard would later return the trash to Bullock.\\\"  From a wide range of sources, Bullock compiled files on 9,876 individuals and more than 950 political groups.  Gerard, whose files contained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people.  In 1987, Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the South African government.  Bullock tells of meetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100 bills.  Bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources. Once he rewrote an innocuous item published by San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African Bishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli -- and submitted it as his own work.  Bullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence.  Bullock said he split about $16,000 from the South African government evenly with Gerard, telling him at one point, \\\"I may be gay but I'm a straight arrow.\\\"  In his interviews with the police and FBI, Bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law.  For example, Bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records and criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer.  And he said Gerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence files on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy.  Bullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation of Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League's San Francisco office.  Bullock seemed proud of his \\\"Operation Eavesdrop,\\\" in which he used a paid informant, code-named Scumbag, to help tap into a White Aryan Resistance phone message network, listening to the messages left by members of the right-wing group.  \\\"For a short time, it was wonderful,\\\" he told police.  In Los Angeles, ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a \\\"fact-finder\\\" to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups.  Among other things, he told San Francisco authorities, the Los Angeles ADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had \\\"anti-Israel leanings\\\" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such sentiment.  Gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he attempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a rival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies.  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival and threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hate group.  Gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the probe, providing considerable information about the ADL operation.  Unlike Bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the investigation.  Gurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewed by The Times. Bullock's attorney said his client would not comment.\",\" And that, of course, is the point.   You can't simply divide the world into atheists and non-atheists on the basis of god-belief.  If all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity, and have nothing to say about behaviour, then belief in a supernatural being is your criterion.  But once you start talking about behaviour, then someone's suscept- ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you  are - I assume - worried about.  And in that area, what you care about is whether someone is sceptical, critical and autonomous on the one hand, or gullible, excitable and easily led on the other.  I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates that a person is easily led.   Whether they have a worship or belief  in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be beside the point.\",\"   And I'm sure that is a great comfort to the widows and children of those stabbed, beaten and burned to death.

Here is my $0.02 on this and related subjects.  One is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related public relations campaign about Iran in recent months. These include:  1) Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade    Center. Despite great efforts in this direction they have not    succeeded in this. They, however, have indirectly created    the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist    Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter.  2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and    other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and    outlaw state.  3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program. I     suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and    perhaps intensify.  Why this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may have been behind this. These include:  1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical    Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This    movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily    fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this     movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return    colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of    democracy and freedom. Also, the obvious support of Algerian    military coup against the democratically elected Algerian    Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth.    A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news    on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems.  2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia    and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil    sources from this region.  3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense    expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of    Soveit Union.  The recent PR campaign against Iran, however, seems to be directed from Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflict of interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion, it is in the interest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal and friendly relations. This may have a moderating effect on the rise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran .\",\" No.  No.  NOOO!!!  The ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if you're grounded in some other way at the same time.    The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly  measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.    They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere, repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things like sub-panels.)  What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact, depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.  There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and news.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) and you should probably read it before asking any more questions.

AA and other 12-step abuse- recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.  Unfortunately, as evidence for God, this can be dismissed by stating that the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes  people 'religious', and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that being religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict, but still maintain that both are escapism.  (And I suspect that there are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to Christianity.)  I think that an essential problem with communication between Christ- ians and atheists is that as Christians we necessarily see ourselves as incomplete, and needing God (the 'God-shaped hole'), while atheists necessarily see themselves as self-sufficient.  If the atheists are right, Christians are guilty of being morally weak, and too cowardly to stand up for themselves; if the Christians are right, the atheists are guilty of considerable arrogance.

The only thing that has happened is that  the two sides have exchanged roles.  The USA has a higher imprisonment rate (400 per 100,000 population) than any country in Europe by a factor of 10 or so.  In California, it is over 600 per 100,000 population.  The prison population in California is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980.  Most of these inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws.  Police now confiscate property, without trial, under a \\\"good faith probable cause\\\" standard, in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drug dealers of their ill-gotten gains.  Conduct an opinion poll, and a majority will answer \\\"yes\\\" if you ask them whether civil liberties and due process should be diluted in order to Send Our Young People The Message That We Are Serious About Winning The War On Drugs.  I don't know whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners, but I would expect the same result.  They certainly seem to vote that way.  According to Jack Herer's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_, over TWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under the marijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their own business and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselves than users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year).  Under the \\\"War on Drugs\\\" campaign of \\\"zero tolerance\\\" due process protections have eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have proliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicians who favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not only legal, but political:  \\\"My fellow Americans, we must send our young people the message that we are serious about winning the War On Murder\\\"--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun prohibition laws.  Gun owners are about to get a taste of the medicine they voted for believing it would be used only on those with different tastes in recreational drugs.

From rec.sport.hockey Thu Apr 15 21:22:49 1993 From: gballent@hudson.UVic.CA (Greg  Ballentine) Message-ID: <1993Apr15.160450.27799@sol.UVic.CA>  [nonsense deleted]  Gainey is the best defensive forward ever.  I stand by that assessment. He was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame.  Did you ever watch him play? He never made a technical error.  [more nonsense deleted]   To knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious.  Your hockey education is not my responsibility.    He was just another player.  To laud him as anything more I find bothersome.  I hated the Habs.  I hated Lafleur until I realized that he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to ever  skate in my lifetime.  Why would anyone talk about Gainey?      Did he play hockey at a high level?  Was he any good?  If not, why would you bother to bring JC up?  I am talking about hockey players here.  If you can't follow the conversation don't follow up.  As I said previously, it is not my responsibility to educate you.   Sure.  Two journeymen.  Big deal.

I've refrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with the OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to say something.  Many things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightest suggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the Gospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death of Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to break down these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  If Moslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't kill them.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions. There are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under attack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are living together peacefully.  The precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two different things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into Canaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have promised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be a holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those attacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be defeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in Joshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was possible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once that was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were expected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of agreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted Bosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior would have disqualified this from being a holy war.  The other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by Assyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel for her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a judgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay of the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because illness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God for good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn't justify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that in attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as *unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God's people, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were actually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action. Furthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are judgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, through his prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets to Bosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting, I am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But that doesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it from judgement.\",\"  The Selke candidate forwards main purpose on a shift is to prevent goals from being scored- not to score them.

EDT                     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good afternoon.                Q   Could we do this on the lawn?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would be nice.  Let's go out  to the cherry blossoms.  We'll do like the President.              Q   Is the stimulus package dead?               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.                Q   Can you tell us more about the Dole talks?  You  said it was a good visit, but no compromise.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  The President had a good talk  with Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before, there  were no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very  good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as  well.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe  Tuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not  speak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the  President was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close  of that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the  President about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked  about that yesterday afternoon.              At the close of that discussion they said that they  would have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator  was up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific  compromises made on either side, they did say that they would  continue to have some discussions.  And that's where we are.              Q   Well, who is giving in?  Where is it standing --are  both making concessions?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that it's at that  phase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said  consistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.   He believes in the package, but he believes that if it's going to  take adjustments to get the minority to release it, he's willing to  make those adjustments.              Q   On the subject of a VAT --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, boy.              Q   Can we stay on this for one more minute?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.              Q   We have a problem with the five minutes --              Q   I know no decisions have been made, but what would  lead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sorry, Andrea, I'm not going to go  down that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said  this morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a  number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked  at.  The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been  made.              Q   To follow, have they done that directly through  him?  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President  about it?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, although  there's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the  VAT.  But the President has not made a decision.              Q   At the meetings that he's had with his own task  force advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the  possible options would be?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that that has been  presented for a decision, no.              Q   Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an  option?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, there are a lot of levels of  briefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the  President as, okay, this is something for you to decide on.                Q   You're not saying he didn't know it was being  considered, though, are you?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he said it's being considered.              Q   He knew that.              Q   But has he discussed that with his advisers?   That's what I'm asking.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said it's being  considered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been  over the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I  don't even know that it's --              Q   But he didn't say he was considering, did he, at  this stage?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he is not.  I think we're  getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is  considered --               Q   Well, he is the one who said, I haven't reviewed  it.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just  repeated.               Q   George, is there any concern here that as a result  of the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if  it were to be considered he'd let us know, and having it trickle out  the way it did, that there may now be the development of a  credibility gap on this issue and others?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.  I mean, it is  now public knowledge that this is being considered.              Q   Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute  statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it  was off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it  come out not from you people, but --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out  from the administration.  What are you talking about?              Q   What I'm saying is, though, that the President said  he would let us know.               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.              Q   You people then said -- you said, I believe, that  it's not going to be on the program.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th.              Q   On March 25th.               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change.              Q   Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out  by rooting around in the fine print of an interview              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do  a very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is -- (laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of  Health and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys  write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the  Clinton administration, the headline is -- I'll look at it right  here, and AP story -- \\\"Clinton wants more money for spying.\\\"              Q   What about his remark that if it were being  considered, he'd tell us about it?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration's concerned,  and he'd let you know.              Q   And did he?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say  this morning?              Q   It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn't have to be dragged out of  me.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of  Health of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his  administration.  That is his administration policy.              Q   Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they  orchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they  answered the questions.              Q   You're saying here that it didn't have to be  dragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were  considering it.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.   Painfully clear.              Q   Was there a particular political strategy in making  it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax  day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being  considered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they  answered that it was being considered.              Q   George, The New York Times --              Q   Why do it yesterday?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked.              Q   The New York Times reports today that Secretary  Reich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and  oranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures  in a way that was supportive of the President's job stimulus bill,  but which turned out to be totally false.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it was totally  false, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor  Department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they  say that.               Q   The question is, is the President concerned about  behavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what's he  doing about it, if so?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a  mistake was made, it won't happen again, and that's the end of the  matter.              Q   Isn't that the same information that goes to the  President?              Q   If I could go back to the stimulus package --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's two separate pieces of  information.  I think that's where the confusion was.              Q   When did you all first learn about this mistake  that was made?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning.              Q   And as far as you know, is the President aware of  it?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so.              Q   And was he aware of it before he read about it in  The New York Times?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  Not to my knowledge.              Q   Did you ever hear about it before this morning?   Anything?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't.              Q   Wasn't the President given an erroneous spin on  this for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I'm not sure.  Both  statements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that  mixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said  it was a mistake.  They said they wouldn't do it again.              Q   Did they drop it -- is this something that you  choose to spin or make an issue of?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of  work, we're gratified.  But that doesn't take away from the need to  get this jobs package going.              Q   If I could go back to the stimulus package for a  minute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an  amendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment  would be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in  the conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting  that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there's no  changes in the schedule at all.  I don't know that they discussed the  timing like that.              Q   Do you believe that you're closer or getting closer  this week than you were last week?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we're going  to pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make  adjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don't know where the  votes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don't know what's  going to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes  deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.              Q   Has there been any indication that this situation  has changed?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work on  it.  We'll know when the votes are taken.              Q   George, last week you said that there are -- or  various people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go  through Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because  he was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the  compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could  accept.  This week you're talking to him.  Is that because you've  realized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's because Senator Dole wanted  to talk to the President about the stimulus package.              Q   He initiated the conversation?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact,  the President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You  say he's making --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that that's exactly  what he said.  I think he said he didn't have any indication that  there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise,  and the President doesn't want to compromise.  And the President  doesn't want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get  it through, he will.              Q   Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was  working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before  the actual vote.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's possible.              Q   Today?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when that will  happen, but I think that it's very possible that we'll come forward  with some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come  forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it  passed.              Q   As we understood his conversations with Dole, the  first one was some discussion of this and I'll get back to you  tonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase  is.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a question of how  detailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the  package last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday  afternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today  in the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator  Dole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific  compromises at this date.  When we have something we'll let you know.   And I'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that  we've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard way.              Q   What are the follow-up discussions if not the  President and Dole?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going  to talk to Senator Dole.              Q   Is that a threat?  (Laughter.)              Q   Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right,  how about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the  President, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was a negotiation  in that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.              Q   Did they discuss actual numbers?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.  I know they  talked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked  about the programs they cared about.  I don't know if they got to the  level of this many x-billion dollars.               Q   Does Dole have to sign off before there is a  package?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not.              Q   Did the White House have anything to do with the  protesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole  was speaking?  Was that in any way organized by --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.              Q   And has the President been in touch with Senators  Kohl or Feingold?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he's talked to them,  no.              Q   George, is the President considering the more  palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the  haves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going  to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves  having to pay for the have-nots?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that  the tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his  budget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your  question, I'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday.              Q   George, on the subject of accuracy in information,  you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money  that would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is  not true.  It's actually waste water money.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's waste water money for  Wisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee.               Q   But it would not affect the drinking water problem  because it's waste water money, right?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment  overall.               Q   But the implication from your statement the other  day was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.   Would you agree that's not the case?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure of the specifics.  I  know that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.              Q   A leftover question from this morning, which was,  when did the President find out that the task force was deliberating  on a VAT?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when.  I just  don't know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between  the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.                Q   So sometime since March 25th?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's right.  I don't know  the exact date.              Q   George, the President this morning mentioned that  some labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the  National Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax  being okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel  that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed,  or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already  proposed?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we've said all we have to  say about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there's just no -- this is  being considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.   The President hasn't made any further decisions beyond that.               Q   But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn't  be to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn't replace the  income tax, for instance?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on  that.              Q   In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress,  Senator Dole's press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you  think -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it  have a chance?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea.               Q   Is that a consideration whether you all put it  forward?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration  if the President were to decide to do it.  It's not in consideration  now.              Q   You said at the beginning of the briefing that  circumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under  consideration.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to  this morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something  that has to be considered.              Q   Those are the circumstances that have changed?   That's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled  it out that groups have asked it to be considered?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what he said.               Q   Is that true?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin  taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to get into the  deliberations.              Q   But, George --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as  the President said, groups came forward and said this is something  you ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it.               Q   Is that the only thing that's changed since his  prior statement and your prior statement on the VAT?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Can you explain how those groups -- how that  information got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading  the newspaper or did groups make presentations?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know,  the health care task force has met with dozens of groups.              Q   But this is the President's knowledge that these  groups had come forward.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what  was coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been  published positions in the newspapers.              Q   Have certain groups briefed him on the group's  presentations to them?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've briefed him  -- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the  working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these  groups.              Q   What kind of arguments did the groups make that  were persuasive enough that the President would change the position  that he had enunciated previously?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know, it's just they've had  longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance  health care.              Q   The President wasn't aware of those longstanding  positions?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.   Obviously, he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the  basic arguments for and against a VAT tax.              Q   What we're trying to figure out here -- you're  telling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this  change in the President's attitude toward the VAT between February  and now --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's attitude hasn't  necessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision.              Q   I know, but the President said that it was off the  table.  So did you.  And you're saying that the only thing that's  changed is the positions of these groups, except you're also  describing them as longstanding positions.  I don't see the change.   If these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been  made to the President --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they've made the  presentations to the health care task force.              Q   There's no relationship at all between the fact  that sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he  favored will not produce enough revenue to finance --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he ever suggested  that they would produce all the revenue.              Q   Well, he suggested that he thought that those were  appropriate ways to finance health care.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don't know that  he said anything to refute that.              Q   But, in fact, has the task force discovered that  there wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind  of core benefits --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't think that the task  force ever suggested that there would.              Q   George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break  his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his  programs?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't comment on a hypothetical  situation.                 Q   But does that promise -- would that promise not to  raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him  from seeking a VAT tax?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions  on the VAT tax.  When he does, we'll tell you and we'll explain the  implications then.              Q   Which specific groups can you cite -- business,  labor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task  force has prompted this consideration?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have the specific.  I just  don't have that.              Q   George, can you tell us to what extend these other  alternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or  other financing options are also still on the table and what these  options are?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force  and representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking  at a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that  there are 20 different options under consideration.  But I'm not  going to comment --              Q   What's the scope --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not going to comment on  them, no.              Q   What's the scope of the need?  How much are you  talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the  --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what the health care task  force is looking at.              Q   Since there's not going to be any briefing on the  Miyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the  President hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his  task complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and  the remark about market access at the press conference?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note?              Q   Does no mean yes.              Q   Yes and no.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know.  I saw the  Prime Minister's press conference where he was asked the question  about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when  he was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that  certainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the  President.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and  the U.S. that we want to do something about.              Q   Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he  suggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in  terms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state  our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit  very clearly.  I don't necessarily want to agree with your  characterization of the Prime Minister's comments.              Q      that we need specific export targets, specific  numerical targets -- is that what he's going to discuss with  Miyazawa?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're going to have a broad  discussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don't want to get into  those specifics until after the meeting.              Q   Why?              Q    That's the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or  not -- does the President believe that without specific numerical  targets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of  hopeless that this is going to change very much?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must  have pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not  want to get into the specifics of how that would be done.              Q   But does the President believe that their stimulus  package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants  to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister  Miyazawa himself, and then he'll make the comment on it.              Q   How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to  be some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary  Christopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do  more, the Japanese saying that that's not what they heard?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we're going to continue to  work with all our allies in the G-7, and we're going to continue to  press for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I  think that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and  we're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral  packages.              Q   Do you think the Japanese need to do more?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work  with all our allies to do as much as we can.              Q   Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today  Show this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher's comments on  the Bosnia policy.  And he said, \\\"It's a rather emotional response.\\\"         MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue.              Q   Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White   House condone that kind of remark?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary  Christopher's remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also  that this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find  answers for.               Q   But that specific -- \\\"rather emotional response\\\" --  specific term?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself.              Q   In connection with that, doesn't it seem that with  the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it  good American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now  to help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example?              Q   To take stronger action, to take military action --  air strikes, anything that can be done?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what  must be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as  you know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms  embargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase  pressure at this time.              Q   What is your response to the critics who would say  that the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain  the presidency?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're wrong.  We're pressing hard  for the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We're pressing hard  for increased sanctions, and we're talking to our allies about the  arms embargo.              Q   You were putting great store in Vance and Owen  getting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said  that military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that  change your thinking?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we're going to listen to  whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to  say.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions  and talking about the arms embargo.              Q   A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She  said she would be able to provide some administration officials who  could document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are  you going to be able to do that, or do you have anything --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's what she said.              Q   That's exactly what she said.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's true.  But  what she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of  evidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are  connections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and  we are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have  an effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute,  what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact  effect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods  into Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What  kind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don't  know.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at  all, I don't know why they'd be fighting it so much.              Q   Are the First Lady's tax returns going to be  released?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a joint tax return.   And it will be probably later today.              Q   Is the President considering signing an executive  order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work  force as part of the gay rights march here next week?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think there's any proposal  for that at this time, not that I know of.              Q   It's something that the President promised during  the campaign that he would do.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don't  think it's anything that's on his plate right now.              Q   Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point  on this issue?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about on this issue.   I assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian  community sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of  different groups and communities.              Q   Do you know if that's scheduled --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's probably going to be tomorrow.              Q   Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.)              Q   It's a good thing you asked.              Q   Who's probably going to be there?  (Laughter.)              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.              Q   How long --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  That's all I know.              Q   Do you know if it's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?   (Laughter.)              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what time it is.  I  don't even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow.              Q   Environmental groups have asked him to make a major  speech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've asked, but  I think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to  give a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it's not  exactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like  that.              Q   Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of  the biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know the specific  timing of something like that, but it's certainly something under  discussion and something we've been working on.              Q   Campaign finance reform?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on it.              Q   Do you think it will be next week?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.              Q   The biodiversity treaty is something you're working  on?  I missed the question.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, something we're working on.   He asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn't know  anything about that but it's something we've certainly been working  on.              Q   Do you know what organizations might be represented  in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't.              Q   Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out  of town on the day of the march?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got to be at the Senate  meeting in Jamestown, and I believe he's also going to be giving a  speech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston  on Sunday, as he did last year.              Q   Would you have told us if she had not pressed you  on the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On what?              Q   On the gays.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  When we went through the  President's schedule for the day, certainly.              Q?     George, what day is the publisher's speech?  Is  that Sunday?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a Sunday.              Q   And Saturday he'll be in Jamestown?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   So you're just going to be in Jamestown for one  day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I'm not sure.  I don't know how  long the Senate thing goes.  It might go overnight.  I just don't  know.              Q   You would have made the gay meeting public, right?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain if we had the meeting  -- I don't know about open to the press, but we would have told you  about it.              Q   I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the  first time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't say it was going to be in  the Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  But I didn't -- I'm not say that it's  not, but I didn't say that it was.  (Laughter.)              Q      at the White House in the Bush administration  gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White  House had to repudiate having done that.  So I just wanted to make  sure --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President wouldn't do  anything like that.              Q   Certainly not.              Q   What marching orders did the President give to  General Vessey?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They had a very good discussion for  about half an hour today.  He wanted -- the most important thing was  he had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs.  He will  obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document.   The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting  and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes  in our policy towards Vietnam.  He'll be looking at Vietnam's  response to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look  into investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on  remains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to  military archives.                And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the  activities of the joint commission and on the document.              Q   Vietnam says it's a fake.  What is the DOD analysis  at this stage?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's not completed yet, and it's  also the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the  Vietnamese.              Q   A number of Defense officials have been saying that  they think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact,  non-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to  as Americans from time to time.  Do people --               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We don't have any final  determination.  We're going to wait for the complete review; when we  have it, we'll make a judgment.              Q   I know you don't have any final determination, but  given all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that  that's a likely possibility?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't want to characterize  it in any way until the review is complete.              Q   George, was there a topic scheduled for the speech  in Boston?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.               Q   Is the President going to have a press conference  tomorrow with Miyazawa?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so, but I'm not positive.   Yes, I expect, yes.              Q   Was Toon in with Vessey?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.               Q   He was in on the meeting?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   What was the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey,  and the answer is yes.               Q   Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal  report this morning the President's distressed about some of his  press clippings and that perhaps he's distressed with you about that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  Well, I do have a response.  I  think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied  that the President has had restricted access to the press.  I would  point out that he's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than  any of his predecessors. I would also point out it also --              Q   How many questions?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Three hundred fifty-eight, on 77  occasions.              Q   How many were while he was jogging?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, that's actually a very  good question, Andrea.  And I would point out further that the  article also implied that these questions were only answered at  tightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.   He's had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval  Office or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to  questions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the --              Q   Oval Office press conference -- when was that?               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's answered questions in the -- East Room.  He's had five in the East Room, he's had one in the Oval  Office, he's had one in the Rose Garden, he's had one or two in the  Roosevelt Room.  And this is just to the White House, Washington  Press Corps.  In addition to that, he's had 17 interviews with local  television anchors.  He's met with the editorial board of The  Portland Oregonian.  He's had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather.  He's had interviews with local press from California, Florida and  Connecticut --              Q   Can you address the question of the attitude?  The  article implies that he doesn't --              Q   Why doesn't he like us?  (Laughter.)              Q   Did you really get blamed for that Post story?              Q   The story is that you -- are you held responsible  for it.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think I'm going to comment  about this.              Q   Are you denying that the President has shown  displeasure publicly?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I am not commenting on the  discussions between the President and myself.              Q   Did the President write that letter to Chris  Webber?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What?              Q   The letter to the University of Michigan basketball  player?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, yes.              Q   That is an authentic letter?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Since the President first talked about the VAT in  February, he said at the time that he thought there probably should  be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.   Does he still hold that position given the impact it could have?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I just can't comment on a  proposal he hasn't made.              Q   George, does the President have some agenda for  this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think it will just a  general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about  including AIDS and other issues -- civil rights.              Q   The military issue?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain it will come up.              Q   Is he using this event to name the AIDS --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.              Q   George, what specifically is the President doing to  prepare for tomorrow's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's had briefing memos.  He's had  general discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the  Trade Representative and others.              Q      report yet?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he has the report  referred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him  today.              Q   He was?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Does he intend to use any of these instances that  --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know that the  report's been presented.  But obviously, the President will press  hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred.              Q   In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was  that there's a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he  feels that way?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the  record in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again,  I think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.  The  thrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the  President may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he  has the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent  history.        Q   Can we come up to your office?  (Laughter.)        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If you're invited.                THE PRESS:  Thank you.                                   END                    1:34 P.M. EDT\",\" If one does not follow the teachings of Christ, he is NOT Christian.   Too easy?     Would you say all Muslims are like Saddam Hussein?  I wouldn't make such a blanket judgement, why do you?\",\"Archive-name: atheism/overview Alt-atheism-archive-name: overview Last-modified: 5 April 1993 Version: 1.2                                     Overview  Welcome to alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.  This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the newsgroups.  Many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles:     1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers    2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism    3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)    4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument    5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources  This is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The others are entirely optional.  If you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup news.announce.newusers.  The articles titled \\\"A Primer on How to Work With the Usenet Community\\\", \\\"Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet\\\" and \\\"Hints on writing style for Usenet\\\" are particularly relevant.  Questions concerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.  If you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the \\\"Finding Stuff\\\" section below.                                      Credits  These files could not have been written without the assistance of the many readers of alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.  In particular, I'd like to thank the following people:  kck+@cs.cmu.edu (Karl Kluge) perry@dsinc.com (Jim Perry) NETOPRWA@ncsuvm.cc.ncsu.edu (Wayne Aiken) chpetk@gdr.bath.ac.uk (Toby Kelsey) jkp@cs.HUT.FI (Jyrki Kuoppala) geoff.arnold@East.Sun.COM (Geoff Arnold) torkel@sics.se (Torkel Franzen) kmldorf@utdallas.edu (George Kimeldorf) roe2@quads.uchicago.edu (Greg Roelofs) arromdee@jyusenkyou.cs.jhu.edu (Ken Arromdee) madhaus@netcom.com (Maddi Hausmann) J5J@psuvm.psu.edu (John A.

These articles are free.  Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute them to anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to the author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network.                                   Finding Stuff  All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are some suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:  1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with    \\\"Alt.Atheism FAQ:\\\".  2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.     If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up    correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the    problem.  3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].    Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest    versions of the FAQ files there.     FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you    need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with        send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq     in the body.  4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article    \\\"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\\\" carries a list of these    sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.  5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu    consisting of the following lines:        send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources       send usenet/alt.atheism/faq       send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction       send usenet/alt.atheism/logic       send usenet/alt.atheism/resources  5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of    the following lines:        send atheism/faq/faq.txt       send atheism/faq/logic.txt       send atheism/faq/intro.txt       send atheism/faq/resource.txt     and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.    There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are \\\"help\\\" and    \\\"send atheism/index\\\".  6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the    newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this    if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to    clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.    it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,    people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have     FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files. \",\"Folks,  I am assembling info for a Film Criticism class final project.

Just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing. You refer to      differing interpretations of \\\"create,\\\" and say that many Christians may      not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith      on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is      truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.       Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created      and eternally existent are equivalent, you say \\\"granted the Mormon      belief...\\\" You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to      have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address      and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the      conclusion that you grant.       The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus      is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS      belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same.  ra> >     Your point that we all are brothers of Jesus and Lucifer is also ra> >     heretical, since we are not innately brothers and sisters of Christ. ra> >     We are adopted, \\\"For ye have not received the spirit of bondage ra> >     again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby ra> >     we cry, Abba, Father.\\\" (Romans 8:15); and not the natural children ra> >     of God.

The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is      nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible      says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:            The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the            kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];           (Matthew 13:38)            I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which            ye have seen with your father. (John 8:38)            Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not            born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.  Jesus said            unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I            proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he            sent me.  Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye            cannot hear my word.  Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the            lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the            beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in            him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a            liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)            And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of            the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease            to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10)            Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this            world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit            that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2)            In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the            devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he            that loveth not his brother. (1 John 3:10)       One becomes a child of God...            But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the           sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)            Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that           we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us           not, because it knew him not.  Beloved, now are we the sons of God,           and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when           he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he           is. (1 John 3:1-2)       ...when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ:            Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of           the will of man, but of God. (John 1:13)            Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus           Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,           (Ephesians 1:5)            Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should           be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (James 1:18)            For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of           God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;           but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,           Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we           are the children of God: (Romans 8:14-16)            Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one           that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. (1 John 4:7)            Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and           every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is           begotten of him.

I don't mean to be snotty about this, ra> but the fact is that the Bible is so differently interpreted by different ra> groups of Biblical scholars (what do you think of the Jehovah's ra> Witnesses, for example?) that to make reference to the \\\"Jesus of the ra> Bible\\\" is simply ridiculous.  Whose \\\"Jesus of the Bible\\\" do you mean?       This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but       rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read       something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches. For       example, the fact that the Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ       does not alter what the Bible teaches [ \\\"Looking for that blessed hope,      and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus      Christ;\\\" (Titus 2:13),\\\"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus      Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through      the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:\\\" (2 Peter 1:1)]       on the Deity of Christ.       We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not       even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that       have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches,       you have to look at the Bible.  ra> >     \\\"Our Lord's mortality was essential to his own salvation\\\" (_The ra> >     Promised Messiah_, p. 456), \\\"He had to work out his own salvation by ra> >     doing the will of the Father in all things\\\" (ibid., p.54), \\\"he had ra> >     to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom\\\" (_Mormon ra> >     Doctrine_, p.71). ra> ra>    Welcome to the wonderful world of Mormon paradoctrine, Robert.

The curious part is that no one addressed the      issue of `Jesus needing to be saved.' Rick comes the closest with his \\\"I      have my own conclusions\\\" to addressing the point.       Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of      Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't      think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the      issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this      subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may       certainly be. \",\"Interestingly enough, in designing the escrow, we may want to use some rather unusual technology, such as sealed boxes of paper, or destructive read memory, rather than typical computer databases, which is fun for a database of hundreds of millions of keys.  The greatest danger of the escrow database, if it were kept on disk, would be the chance that a complete copy could somehow leak out.  You can design lots of protection, but with enough corruption a complete copy is always possible.   Storing it on paper or something very hard to copy at once may actually make sense.  Or a medium that can't be copied -- for example, something with very slow access times or which leaves a destructive trail if it is even read.  Of course then it's hard to backup.  However, I think the consequences of no backup -- the data is not there when a warrant comes -- are worse than the consequences of a secret backup.  An audit trail that reveals when data has been access, that *can't* be erased by the humans involved, is also necessary.\",\"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----    The point you all seem to have missed was covered when the UK cellphone scrambling system was discussed.  Incidentally, my MP has responded to my questions on that issue, and it appears that the UK and other `approved' countries will get the secure A5 encryption, and `dodgy' countries will get A5X.  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used with A5X systems, but newer equipment will use A5/A5X/clear depending on the capabilities of the base station.  The cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key to listen in to cellular conversations.  Encryption is not end-to-end, but  cellphone to base-station - it *has* to be this way so that cellular users and fixed installations can talk to each other.  For cellular to cellular calls, the transmission is decrypted at the base-station, passed to another base-station and re-encrypted.  The cops/feds can listen to the unscrambled call *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider's equipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can listen without having to obtain a warrant.  But, maybe the Clipper system is secure, and they really do need a warrant to get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner (see above - they don't *have* to go down this route anyway).  I have my doubts, but even if true once they have the key they will *never* again need a warrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want.  `Well, Judge, it appears he wasn't a drug-dealer after all, so naturally we'll stop listening in'...

It is extremely easy to use, make reports, etc.  I own both it and Paradox, and I almost never use Paradox.  If you need to  build up a complicated application, then Paradox is the way to go.  I have heard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic. Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/ home use and you have not used a database before), I recommend Approach.  I  have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily: I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must  be different than what is the logical ordering.  To permanently reorder (to  use the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records  appropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order) exporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach  database), and then copying the exported files back to the original  filename.  This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really  like about Approach.  It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than  the loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load).

One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is whether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock the instrument into real time capture mode.   I agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are _beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus. However, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students) seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or more knobs required of a \\\"real\\\" scope :-)   This is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at least they appear to be logically laid out.  One more thing about the new, \\\"simpler\\\", front panels. These instruments tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the longevity of the instruments.

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to have a \\\"dirty\\\" amp.     Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,    that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs  Not possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.     for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt    radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet     away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.    If you experience the problem frequently, it may be     caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station    nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio     transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,    etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are    correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.     If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite    chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably    being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can    be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).    Good instructions are included with the chokes.    If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your    neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof    or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things    a radio operator can do to reduce interference.  And please remember to be friendly when approaching your local radio operator.  This person may or may not be the  cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most are).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes dealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b. interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.    BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or not he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it. Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers to take any precautions.  Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more than 10).  So if you hear \\\"This is WA1QT\\\" or some other call starting with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.

What do you mean fair?  God is just, giving to everyone what they deserve. As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf Romans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.  Hence, the unbaptized infants are cut off from the God against whom they, with the whole of the human race except Mary, have sinned.  Which is why Jesus said, \\\"Truly, truly I say to you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless he is born of water and Spirit\\\" which is the true meaning of born again (John 3.5).  Thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be cut off from God and exlcuded from heaven.  As St. Augustine said, \\\"I did not invent original sin, which the Catholic faith holds from ancient time; but you, who deny it, without a doubt are a follower of a new heresy.\\\"  (De nuptiis, lib. 11.c.12)\",\" If you are really interested in these orbits and how they are obtained you should try and find the following paper:       Hiroshi Yamakawa, Jun'ichiro Kawaguchi, Nobuaki Ishii,       and Hiroki Matsuo, \\\"A Numerical Study of Gravitational Capture      Orbit in the Earth-Moon System,\\\" AAS-92-186, AAS/AIAA Spaceflight      Mechanics Meeting, Colorado Springs, Colorado, 1992.  The references included in this paper are quite interesting also and  include several that are specific to the HITEN mission itself. \",\"   More like Philadelphia making dust out of dead Leafs. Roger why do you continue to embarass yourself with your brash predictions?  They got whitewashed by a last place team.  Granted Philly is pretty decent but the \\\"best team in the Cambell Conference\\\" would have beaten a last place team. \",\"Where can I find the MS windows version of ghostscript?

But alas, it is not true of history.  The Bible does not have a  message -- it has messages.  And some of those are messages of repentance and giving, to turn the other cheek, and do unto the least of these.  But some of the messages are the complete opposite.  Like the isrealites order to  wipe out other tribes including women and children down to cattle, and  punished severely when they were less than complete about the job.  Like jews who are said to have cried out in Matthew, \\\"His blood be upon our heads and our childrens heads\\\" A verse quoted in every pogrom from the crusades to the holocaust.  Have these been misunderstood?  I think not.  They have only been understood too clearly.  It is essential that christians grasp firmly the good the bible teaches, the meek carpenter from Nazareth is a potent  symbol for how we should be, his teachings we must take to heart, but we cannot ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking and say those who live by that have misread it.  To say that is only to chose a point of interpretation and declare it normative.  Such can be done with the same legitmacy by anyone.  Instead we must let the text critique the text. Understanding that there is both good and bad in our sacred corpus, we test all things and hold fast to that which is good.   At the risk of sounding heretical (well ok, more heretical) I don't think that doubt is something which requires forgiveness, it is something which requires introspection and reflection.  If that is a sin, then there can be no salvation, for doubt is an inescapble part of being human.  Consider Job.  His friends had no doubt. Whereas Job had no doubt in himself but doubted the wisdom and justice of God.  When God finally did appear he  rebuked the friends and had job make sacrifices for them.  To be a Christian it to always have doubt, or not to have honesty.\",\"Enclosed are the rules, guidelines and related information for the 10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest.

The IOCCC has also done much to add X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language. X    (see \\\"The New Hacker's Dictionary\\\" by Eric Raymond) X  X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical  X    closing date for contests are in early May. X  X    The contest rules are posted to comp.unix.wizards, comp.lang.c, X    misc.misc, alt.sources and comp.sources.d.

For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side to the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.  Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a couple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an efficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour).  Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the temperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably its power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no leakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more (although that would be a lousy way to control it).  What I would like to know is:  1: Are the above guesses correct?  2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?    (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm    too fast when I unplug it)  3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?  It looks like    magic!  4: Why don't they use these things in domestic fridges/freezers?

Helsingius?   * * *   IDENTITY ========  _____ <1.1> What is `identity' on the internet?    Generally, today people's `identity' on the internet is primarily   determined by their email address in the sense that this is their   most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm.   This is your   login name qualified by the complete address domain information,   for example ``ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu''.  People see   this address when receiving mail or reading USENET posts from you   and in other situations where programs record usage.  Some obsolete   forms of addresses (such as BITNET) still persist.    In email messages, additional information on the path that a message   takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient.  This   information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the   transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination.  This   type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET   protocol to a lesser extent.  Forging these fields requires   corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and   is very uncommon.  Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the   origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked   at the time the message is created.  Tracing these messages can be   difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of   real machines and represent real transfer routes.  _____ <1.2> Why is identity (un)important on the internet?    The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication,   privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of   computer networks. For example, the convenience of communication   afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for   identification.  But there are many potential abuses of identity   possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive   computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can   potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems.    Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication',   and one classic example of the problems associated with it is   H.G.Well's ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled   segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was   in progress.  Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and   forged identities makes them more insidious.  People and their   reputations can be assaulted by forgery.    However, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of   its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is   harmful.  A professor might carefully explain a topic until he   finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular   occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally   shun him.  Some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many   prejudices are useful!  A scientist might argue he can better   evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more   about the authors.  Likewise, he may be more likely to reject it   based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  On the other side of the   connection,  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in   exerting pressure for acceptance.    Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating   `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'.    Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques   for identification. Heavy reliance will be placed on digital   authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic.    Many government functions and services are based on identification,   and law enforcement frequently hinges on it.  Hence, employees of   many government organizations push toward stronger identification   structures.  But when does identification invade privacy?    The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive   proportions. Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect   many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly   global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or   adverse affects of these actions, intended and inadvertent,  will   literally be magnified exponentially.  _____ <1.3> How does my email address (not) identify me and my background?    Your email address may contain information that influences people's   perceptions of your background.  The address may `identify' you as   from a department at a particular university, an employee at a   company, or a government worker.  It may contain your last name,   initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both.  In   the US some are based on parts of social security numbers.  Others   are in the form 'u2338' where the number is incremented in the   order that new users are added to the system.    Standard internet addresses  also can contain information  on your   broad geographical location or nationhood.  However, none of this   information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all.  The   fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on   rather arbitrary organization, such as (mostly invisible) network   cabling distributions.  The only point to make is that early fields   in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names   or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as   continental domains).  Typically the first field is the name of the   computer receiving mail.    Gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an   inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise.  (For more   information, see the FAQs on email  addresses and known   geographical distributions below.)  However, UNIX utilities exist   to aid in the quest (see the question on this).    Common Suffixes   ---------------    .us    United States   .uk    United Kingdom   .ca    Canada   .fi    Finland   .au    Australia    .edu   university or college   .com   commercial organization   .org   'other' (e.g. nonprofit organization)   .gov   government   .mil   military site   _____ <1.4> How can I find out more about somebody with a given email address?    One simple way is to send email to that address, asking.  Another   way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e.   postmaster@address), although the postmaster's job is more to help   find user ID's of particular people given their real name and solve   mail routing problems.  The sysadmin (i.e. `root@address') may also   be able to supply information.  Users with related email address   may have information.  However, all of these methods rely on the   time and patience of others so use them minimally.    One of the most basic tools for determining identity over the   internet is the UNIX utility 'finger'.  The basic syntax is:      finger user@here.there.everywhere    This utility uses communication protocols to query the computer   named in the address for information on the user named.  The   response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may   be in any format.  Possible responses are as follows:    - A message `unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is     incorrect, two lines with no information and '???'.      - A message 'In real life: ???' in which case the receiving computer     could not find any kind of a match on the username. The finger     utility may return this response in other situations.      - A listing of information associated with multiple users. Some     computers will search only for matching user IDs, others will     attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all     actual full names of users kept in a local database.      At some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the   system with a `finger @address'.  In general this is often   considered weak security, however, because `attackers' know valid   user ID's to `crack' passwords.    More information on the fields returned by `finger' is given below.    More information on `finger' and locating people's email addresses   is given in the email FAQ (such as the WHOIS lookup utility).  Just   as you can use these means to find out about others, they can use   them to find out about you.  You can `finger' yourself to find out   what is publicly reported by your UNIX system about you.  Be   careful when modifying `finger' data; virtually anyone with   internet access worldwide can query this information.  In one   amazing case, the New York Times writer J. Markoff uncovered the   identity of R. Morris, author of the Internet Worm,  through   the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'.  See the book Cyberspace   by K. Hafner and J. Markoff.  _____ <1.5> Why is identification (un)stable on the internet?    Generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept   on the Internet for a variety of reasons.  One is the inherent   fluidity of `cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge   frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the `community'.    Most people remember faces and voices, the primary means of casual   identification in the 'real world'.  The arbitary and cryptic    sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are   not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique   identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on   multiple machines anywhere in the world.    Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances   that the messages in email and USENET are from who they appear to   be. A person's mailing address is far from an identification of an   individual.        - Anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password,     either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address     in the From: line.      - Email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as     they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations.     - As part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the From:     line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many     hackers.        The status and path information prepended to messages by   intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. In general, while   possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in   email.  Besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic   problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification   on the internet:    - Internet mail standards, described in RFC-822, are still evolving     rapidly and not entirely orderly.  For example, standards for     mail address `munging' or `parsing' tend to vary slightly between     sites and frequently mean the difference between finding     addresses and bouncing mail.      - Domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites,     and there are delays in the propagation of this data.      - Addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers     crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved     in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers'.       - A whole slew of problems is associated with  `nameservers'; if     they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even     the operation of what constitutes `updating' has different     interpretations at different sites.      The current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly   anachronistic in that they were created when the network was   somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the   traffic it now sees.  Today a large proportion of internet traffic   is email, comprising  millions of messages.  _____ <1.6> What is the future of identification on the internet?    Some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images   and voice messages  into mail and these will improve the sense of   community that comes from the familiarity of identification.   However, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts   of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises   in privacy.    Promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures'   and 'digital authentication' common (see below).  Also, the trend   in USENET standards is toward greater authentication of posted   information.  On the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity   (such as remailers) are forthcoming.  See below.   PRIVACY =======  _____ <2.1> What is `privacy' on the internet?    Generally, while `privacy' has multiple connotations in society and   perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to   mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the   data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do   not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches.  In other words,    others may obtain data associated with your account, but not   without your permission.  These ideas are probably both fairly   limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users   consider their private domains.  Some users don't expect or want   any privacy, some expect and demand it.  _____ <2.2> Why is privacy (un)important on the internet?    This is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing   passionate opinions.  On the internet, some take privacy for   granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent.   Most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the   illegal search and seizure clause of the U.S. constitution, adopted   by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws   prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). These   rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules   governing it.  However, the legal repercussions of the global   internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong   legal precedents and court cases).  The fact that internet traffic   frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not   centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly   discourages its regulation.  _____ <2.3> How (in)secure are internet networks?    - `Theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with     access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the     Internet  could potentially monitor or archive it. However, the     sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes     these scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies     with supposedly vast funding and resources.      - Technologies exist to `tap' magnetic fields given off by     electrical wires without detection.  Less obscurely, any machine     with a network connection is a potential station for traffic     detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to     very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even     possible.      - A company Network General Inc. is one of many that manufactures     and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can     'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for     troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is     prohibitive for casual use.    Known instances of the above types of security  breaches at a major   scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. The greatest risks   tend to emerge locally.  Note that all these approaches are almost   completely defused with the use of cryptography.      _____ <2.4> How (in)secure is my account?    By default, not very.  There are a multitude of factors that may   reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet.    First, your account must be secure from other users. The universal   system is to use a password, but if it is `weak' (i.e. easy to   guess) this security is significantly diminished.  Somewhat   surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain  users of the   system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited   access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to   others.  This means that they may read any file in your account   without detection.    Furthermore, not universally known, most UNIX systems keep fairly   extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what   commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login   information is usually public). Most features of this `auditing' or    `process accounting' information are enabled by default after the   initial installation and the system administrator may customize it   to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims.    This information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting   purposes and may otherwise be ignored.  This data tracks   unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on   the system. A traditional part of the UNIX system that tracks user   commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of   symbolic links (described  in 'man ln').      UNIX implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features   and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies   regularly. Typically system adminstrators augment the basic UNIX   functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed   tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate `suspicious'   activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the 'passwd' file, incorrect   login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.).      Generally, you should expect little privacy on your account for   various reasons:      - Potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by     someone else.     - System administrators make extensive backups that are completely     invisible to users which may record the states of an account over     many weeks.     - Erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted.     - Most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or     otherwise; for example FTP sites usually log the commands and     record the domain originations of users, including anonymous     ones.    - Some software exacerbates these problems.  See the section on     ``X Windows (in)security''.    Indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much   more commonly harmful threat. There are multiple ways to help   ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and   compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines:    - Choose a secure password.  Change it periodically.   - Make sure to logout always.   - Do not leave a machine unattended for long.   - Make sure no one watches you when you type your password.   - Avoid password references in email.   - Be conservative in the use of the .rhost file.   - Use utilities like `xlock' to protect a station, but be     considerate.    Be wary of situations where you think you should supply your   password.  There are only several basic situations where UNIX   prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or   changing your password.  Situations can arise in which prompts for   passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you   are talking to them (such as Internet Relay Chat).  Also, be  aware   that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain    passwords.     (Thanks to Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu> for contributions   here.)  _____ <2.5> How (in)secure are my files and directories?    The most important privacy considerations are related to file   rights, and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature   or haphazard maintenance. Be aware of the rights associated with   your files and directories in UNIX. If the `x' (`execute') right on   your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, these   users cannot gain information on anything in your directories.    Anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete   files in your home directory. The rights on a directory supersede   the rights associated with files in that directory. For a   directory, 'x' means that access to the files (or subdirectories)   in the directory is possible -- if you know their names.  To list   the contents of the directory, however, requires the 'r' right.     By default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the   initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator   preference.  The default file mode specifies the initial rights   associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell   with `umask'.  The details of rights implementations tend to vary   between versions of UNIX.  Consult man pages on `chmod' and `ls'.    Examples   --------      traver.lance % ls -ld ~     drwx------ 15 ld231782     1536 Jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/    Here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home   directory, denoted by `~'.  The columns at the left identify what   rights are available. The first column identifies the entry as a   directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and   execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user.  For   directories, the `x' right means that contents (file and   subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. The   subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to   anything in the directory tree originating at that point.  They   can't even `see' any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy   is completely invisible to them.      traver.lance % ls -l msg     -rw-r--r--  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg     traver.lance % chmod u=rw,g=,o= msg     traver.lance % ls -l msg     -rw-------  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg    Here the modes on the file `msg' were changed to take away rights   from `group' and `other'.       Note that `ls -l <file>' requires both the 'r' right to get the list   of files and subdirectories, and the 'x' right to access the files   and subdirectories in order to get their size, etc. For example,   suppose the directory `foo' has rights dr--r--r--,  the following   is possible:      ls foo    These commands would fail independent of file rights:        ls -l foo     ls -l foo/file     cat foo/file     cd foo    If the directory `foo' has rights d--x--x--x, the following are   possible if it is known beforehand that `foo' contains an 'r'   readable file named `file':        ls -l foo/file     cat foo/file     cd foo      The following commands fail:        ls foo     ls -l foo       (Thanks to Uwe Waldmann <uwe@mpi-sb.mpg.de> for contributions here.)  _____ <2.6> How (in)secure is X Windows?    X Windows is the primary software developed by the MIT Athena   project which is funded by U.S. government grants to develop   applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing   computational tasks, particularly the human-computer interface.    The software implements a client-server interface to a computer via   graphical windows. In this case the `client' is the application   requesting or utilizing  graphical resources (such as windows or a   mouse) and the `server' is the machine that provides them.  In many   situations the client is an application program running on the same   machine as the server.    The great utility of X Windows comes from its complete dissociation   of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast' to a   server at a remote location from the  client. Unfortunately this   dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated   security considerations.  The primary security and privacy issue   associated with X Windows is that much more sensitive data may be   sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where   the human is situated near the host computer.  Currently there is   no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in X   Windows.    Due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design   flaws,  early versions of the X Window system are extremely   insecure. Anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt   that display or read it electronically based on access to the   device unix:0.0 by any regular user.   There are no protections   from this type of access in these versions.   The problem arises   because the security is completely based on machine addresses   rather than users, such that any user at a `trusted' machine is   himself trusted. Quoting from X documentation (man Xsecurity):      > Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed   > access to the X server. This system can work reasonably well in   > an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a   > single person can log into a given machine...This system does not   > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and   > mutual trust does not exist.       With the access control list, the `xhost' command may prevent some   naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0   evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is  ``xhost   +[name]'' where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an   authorized client machine. By default clients running nonlocal to   the host are disabled.  Public domain programs to disrupt a display   momentarily (such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image, or   cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom) have been circulating on   the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks   on unsuspecting or inexperienced users.  Much more serious security   breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this   inherent weaknesses.  (The minimal, easily-bypassed `trusted'   security mode of `xhost' has been jokingly referred to as ``X   Hanging Open, Security Terrible.'').     New versions of the X Window system (X11R5 and higher) by default    make server access as secure as the file system using a .Xauthority   file and 'magic cookies'.  Remote machines must have a code in the   .Xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code   allowed by the server.  Many older programs and even new   vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with   `magic cookies'. The basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to   monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of   keys occurs in transmission.  X11R5 also includes other   sophisticated encryption mechanisms.  Try `man Xsecurity' to find   out what is supported at your site.  Even though improved security    mechanisms have been available in X Windows since ~1990, local   sites often update this software infrequently because installation   is extremely complex.     (Thanks to Marc Vanheyningen <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>,    Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu>, and Bill Marshall   <marshall@cs.iastate.edu> for contributions here.)  _____ <2.7> How (in)secure is my email?    By default, not very.  The characters that you are reading are   almost certainly encoded in ASCII, the American Standard Code for   Information Interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic   characters onto numeric codes and vice versa.  Virtually every   computer system uses this code, and if not, has ways of converting   to and from it.  When you write a mail message, by default it is   being sent in ASCII,  and since the standard is virtually   universal, there is no intrinsic privacy.  Despite milleniums worth   of accumulated cryptographic knowledge, cryptographic technologies   are only recently being established that afford high priority to   privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design.  Some   potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows:    - The most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous     system operators reading private mail in the `spool files' at a     local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message),     such as a university.       - System administrators may also release files to law enforcement     agencies, but conventions and protocols for warrants involving     computer searches have still not been strongly established and     tested legally.    - Note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in     their entirety.  This means that if you address mail with an     incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human     other than the recipient.    - Typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local     mail directory is private, but this is not guaranteed and can be     overridden.    - Finally, be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of      everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail      routing software mechanisms.  This `feature' can be disabled.    Most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly   avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography, which has   its own set of caveats (for example, unscrupulous administrators   may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or   nonlocal).  See the sections on ``email privacy'' and ``email   policies.''  _____ <2.8> How am I (not) liable for my email and postings?    As punishment or whatever, your system administrator can revoke   certain `privileges' such as emailing, USENET posting or reading   certain groups, file transferring, remote communications, or   generally any subset of capabilities available from your account.    This all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator   and under the procedures followed at a particular site, which in   many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented.  Currently there are   virtually no widespread, uniform guidelines or procedures  for   restricting use to any internet services, and local administrators   are free to make arbitrary decisions on access.    Today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations.   In the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator   regarding abuses by a user, usually but not necessarily preceded by   complaints to the user in email, regarding that person's   objectionable email or postings.  `abusive' posters to USENET are   usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as   urged by others on the `net'. (The debate persists endlessly on   many newsgroups whether this is also used  as a questionable means   of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots' or censoring   unpopular opinions.)      System administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to   'squelch' severe cases of abuse.  In general, however, by tradition   Usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of   the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe   their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options   wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next   message (referred to as ``hitting the `n' key''), or to `plonk'   annoying posters (according to the Hacker's Dictionary, the sound a   jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file).    In cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system   administrators are least likely to restrict email.  USENET postings   are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or    entire groups (such as a university campus).  Restrictions are most   commonly associated with the following `abuses':    - harassing or threatening notes, `email terrorism'   - illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material   - `ad hominem' attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the     poster instead of citing the content of the message   - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness   - inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups     `mail-bombing': inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive     files    Major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and   official email or postings.  Most users have internet access via   accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the   internet can be construed as representative of their parent   organizations. Many people put disclaimers in their `signatures' in   an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent   organizations as a precaution. A recent visible political case   involves the privacy of electronic mail  written by White House   staff members of the Bush administration.  Following are some   guidelines:    - Acquaint yourself with your company or university policy.   - If possible, avoid use of your company email address for private     communication.   - Use a disclaimer.   - Keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars' or simply don't post).   - Avoid posting information that could be  construed to be     proprietary or `internal'.    The following references are available from ftp.eff.com   (see also the section on ``internet use policies''):    /pub/academic/banned.1991   /pub/academic/banned.1992   ---     Computer material that was banned/challenged in academia in 1991     and 1992 including USENET hierarchies.    /pub/academic/cases   ---     This is an on-line collection of information about specific     computers and academic freedom cases. File README is a detailed     description of the items in the directory.    /pub/academic/faq/netnews.liability   ---     Notes on university liability for Usenet.  _____ <2.9> How do I provide more/less information to others on my identity?    The public information of your identity and account is mostly   available though the UNIX utility `finger' described above.       - You have control over most of this information with the utility     `chfn', the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use     `passwd -f').       - You can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is     copied directly to the destination during the fingering.         - A technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is     'finger'ing you and even to  vary the .plan file sent to them.        - Your signature is determined by the environment variable SIGNATURE        - USENET signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file     in your home directory.        Providing less information on your online identity is more difficult   and involved.  One approach is to ask your system adminstrator to   change or delete information about you (such as your full name).    You may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from   someone unrelated to you personally.  You may be able to remotely   login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not   physically near.  These are tactics for hiding or masking your   online activities but nothing is foolproof.  Consult man pages on   the 'chmod' command and the default file mode.  Generally, files on   a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very   little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators.    To mask your identity in email or on USENET you can use different   accounts. More untraceable are new `anonymous posting' and   remailing services that are very recently being established.  See   below.  ______ <2.10> Who is my sysadmin?  What does s/he know about me?    The requirements and screening for getting a system administration   job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely   between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at   universities.  Many UNIX systems at universities are largely   managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often   `hacking'.  In general, commercial and industrial sites are more   strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are   extremely strict.    The system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you   used and at what times.  S/he may have a record (backups) of files   on your account over a few weeks. S/he can monitor when  you send   email or post USENET messages, and potentially read either.  S/he   may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using,   both locally and elsewhere.  Administrators sometimes employ   specialized programs to  track `strange' or `unusual' activity,   which can potentially be misused.  ______ <2.11> Why is privacy (un)stable on the internet?    For the numerous reasons listed above, privacy should not be an   expectation with current use of the internet.  Furthermore, large   parts of the internet are funded by the U.S. NSF (National Science   Foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as   prohibiting commercial use).  Some high-level officials in this and   other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to   guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services).    Historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been   local. Perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread   occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some   portion of USENET newsgroups labelled as `pornographic'. The   `alternative' hierarchy in the USENET system, which has virtually   no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is   frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere).    From the global point of view traffic is generally completely   unimpeded on the internet  and only the most egregious offenders   are pursued.  For example,  verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted   material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to   USENET with regularity without major consequences (some email   complaints may ensue).  More astonishing to some is that currently   significant portions of USENET traffic, and less so internet   traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost   entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as   `alt.sex' regularly have the  highest traffic).    ______ <2.12> What is the future of privacy on the internet?    Some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or   appropriate level of privacy.  Others will argue that as a   prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate   safeguards.  The internet is growing to become a completely global,   international superhighway for data, and this traffic will   inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and   many other items of extremely personal nature. Computer items that   many people consider completely private (such as their local hard   drives) will literally be inches from global network connections.   Also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged   over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with   the internet.      Most would agree that, for these basic but sensitive uses of the   internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to   ensure much privacy. New standards are calling for uniform   introduction of `privacy enhanced mail' (PEM) which uses encryption   technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is   automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards.    The same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy   (such as with  surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly   effective in protecting  it (e.g. with encryption). Some government   agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe   that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct   (e.g. court-authorized wiretapping).  However, powerful new   technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming   increasingly popular, provoking some to say that ``the cat is out   of the bag'' and the ``genie can't be put back in the bottle''.  In   less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong   cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically   unstoppable.      To date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure   communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two   goals are largely incompatible). Proposals for ``registration'' of   secret keys (by D. Denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met   with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst,   mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections   of inherent feasibility.  Electronic privacy issues, and   particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will   foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few   years.   ANONYMITY =========  _____ <3.1> What is `anonymity' on the internet?    Simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the   ultimate in privacy. However, there are several variations on   this simple theme.  A person may wish to be consistently   identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle' and establish a   reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity.   A person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single   one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run'). Or, a person may   wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with   others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an   `anonymous return address'.  A user may wish to appear as a   `regular user' but actually be untraceable.  Sometimes a user   wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the   message itself). The anonymous item itself may be directed at   individuals or groups.  A user may wish to access some   service and hide all  signs of the association.       All of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently   tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking   mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols.    Officials of the NSF and other government agencies may be opposed   to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse.    Nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will   always guarantee a certain element of anonymity.  _____ <3.2> Why is `anonymity' (un)important on the internet?    Anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or   problematic depending on its use.  Arguably absence of   identification is important as the presence of it.  It may be the   case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be   discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true   anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish.    One can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague   that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as   employer/employee scenarios).  One can use it to pass information   and evade any threat of direct retribution.  For example,   `whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses (economic, social,   or  political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or   retaliation. Sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information   is often posted to some USENET groups, a risky situation where   anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely   independent of the identities of the participants.  Some police   departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of   crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network.   Unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with   assurances of anonymity.  _____ <3.3> How can anonymity be protected on the internet?    The chief means, as alluded to above, are masking identities in   email and posting. However, anonymous accounts (public accounts as   accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be   effective as well, but this use is generally not officially   supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and NSF   guidelines.  The nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining   accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous   accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large.    Many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to   anonymity.  Virtually every protocol in existence currently   contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet.   New communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee   much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication.  _____ <3.4> What is `anonymous mail'?    One approach to `anonymizing' mail has been to set up an `anonymous   server' that, when activated by email to its address, responds by   allocating and supplying an `anonymous ID' that is unique to the   person requesting it (based on his email address).  This will vary   for the same person for different machine address email   originations. To send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed   to the server containing the final destination. The server   `anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information   and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the   anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id.    This is the `interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity   mentioned above.    Another more `fringe' approach is to run a `cypherpunk' remailer   from a regular user account (no root system privileges are   required). These are currently being pioneered by  Eric Hughes and   Hal Finney <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>. The operator runs a process on   a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain   characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail   (typically fields in the header). One has been implemented as a    PERL script running on UNIX.  Several of these are in existence   currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable;   they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge.   The remailers don't generally support anonymous return addresses.    Mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator.    Generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any   responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system,   although actually may be held liable regardless.    These approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses:      - The anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of     anonymous ID's to real addresses that must be maintained     indefinitely.  One alternative is to allow `deallocation' of     aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been     implemented yet.    - Although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could     conceivably be monitored from the `outside', necessitating the     use of cryptography for basic protection,.    - Local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or     under pressure from local, network, or government agencies.      - Unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic     that goes through them.    - Most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected.     - The cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these     operators are basically  network users who do not own the     equipment and are accountable  to their own system     administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic     to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered,     regarding it as illicit use.     - In all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous     server operator by the user.    Currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using SMTP   protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary   field information.  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the   approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by   most system administrators.  Information in the header routing data   and logs of network port connection information may be retained   that can be used to track the originating site.  In practice, this   is generally infeasible and rarely carried out.  Some   administrators on the network will contact local administrators to   request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished   more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually   happening occasionally but infrequently.    See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and    ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.  _____ <3.5> What is `anonymous posting'?    Anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous Usenet   posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic,   capricious or risky local circumstances, logging).  Make sure to   test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to   misc.test (however some operators don't recommend this because many   sites `autorespond' to test messages, possibly causing the   anonymous server to allocate anonymous IDs for those machines).    See the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting''   before proceeding.    Another direct route involves using NNTP protocols to submit a   message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information.   This practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed   with hostility by most system administrators, and similar   consequences can ensue.    See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and    ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.  _____ <3.6> Why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet?    As noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available   to the general internet community, and these services should be   used with great caution.  To summarize, the technology is in its   infancy and current approaches are unrefined, unreliable, and not   completely trustworthy.  No standards have been established and   troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software   are prevalent.  Here are some encountered and potential bugs:       - One  anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous     return addresses.    - Others passed signature information embedded in messages     unaltered.    - Address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced     to a remailer are common.   - Forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem,  possibly     allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon ID - email     address  mappings in the alias file.  This can be remedied with     the use of passwords.   - Infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers.      Source code is being distributed, tested, and refined for these   systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly.  The   field is not likely to improve considerably without  official   endorsement and action by network agencies.  The whole idea is   essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and   distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable   to criminality.  The major objection to anonymity over regular   internet use  is the perceived lack of accountability to system   operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting   from outside complaints.  System adminstrators at some sites have   threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the   prominent servers from their redistribution flows.  This may only   have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less   characteristically detectable headers.  Probably the least   problematic approach, and the most traditional to Usenet, is for   individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer,   e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files.    _____ <3.7> What is the future of anonymity on the internet?    New anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase   safeguards of anonymity.  For example, the same mechanism that   routes email over multiple hosts, thereby threatening its privacy,   can also be used to guarantee it. In a scheme called `chaining' an   anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers   before reaching a destination.  In this way generally multiple   links of the chain have to be `broken' for security to be   compromised. Re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even   more unlikely.  Even more significantly the anonymous remailers   could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses   (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation)   would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message   tracing. However, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible.      The future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time,   highly uncertain and fraught with peril. While specific groups seem   to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many   feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a   disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in   `serious' groups.   The introduction of unlimited group anonymity   may have fundamental repercussions on Usenet conventions and   distribution mechanisms such as moderated and `alt' groups have had   in the past. For example, as part of new group creation, the   charter may specify whether `anonymous' posting is (un)welcome.     Nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may   be inevitable. Based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are   in huge demand. Pervasive and readily available anonymity could   carry significant and unforeseen social consequences.  However, if   its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may   be confined to the underground.  The ramifications of widespread   introduction of anonymity to Usenet are still largely unknown. It   is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new   traffic or, instead of expansion, cause a shift where a greater   portion of existing traffic is anonymized.  Conceivably the   services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social   acceptance of Usenet.   * * *\",\"Dear friend,   The RISC means \\\"reduced instruction set computer\\\".

Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would make players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the lower levels of professional hockey in North America?

(ie. the Jets do have a few Russian players in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.)) So with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players in North America.   I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the world.

Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked  at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they were 24, and noticed some interesting things.     For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also   found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away the second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc.     It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory.

The speaker went scratchy, and I want    to access its pins.  Why are you posting this tripe to rec.autos.vw?\",\" Ok, here's what I understand:  The SL/SL1/SL2/SW1/SW2 was meant to compete with the following cars:  Honda Civic Toyota Tercel (SL,SL1) Toyota Corolla (SL1,SL2) Nissan Sentra Mazda 323/Protoge' Subaru Loyale/Impreza Isuzu Stylus Geo Prizm Ford Escort Mercury Tracer Mistubishi Mirage Plymouth/Dodge Colt   Their core competition is the Civic, Corolla, and Sentra.  Most of the other models are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of. I threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese technology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn't include domestic small cars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I think Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese roots.  The SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:  Toyota Paseo Honda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si Nissan NX1600/NX2000 Mazda MX-3 Isuzu Impulse Geo Storm Ford Escort GT   If you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're 4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and trend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan platforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher prices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:  Tercel -> Paseo Sentra -> NX1600/NX2000 Civic -> del Sol 323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one) Stylus -> Impulse/Storm  To illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at around $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now, you might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doors offer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable powerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let's take another example: the Isuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a 1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive. Again, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more fashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more money for this type of car.     In short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence \\\"less\\\" car, it's market orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent sedan (SL1/SL2) version.  I hope this clears things up a bit...... \",\"  Actually I don't think there is any conflict if we really understand what these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the  meaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will come to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere  belief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your  belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this  is what James means when he says that \\\"faith without works is dead\\\"  and, \\\"I will show you my faith by my works.\\\"  Remember James was  writing to \\\"the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.\\\"  This  probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much  later and wouldn't understand the meaning of the original Greek. (Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he intended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the people of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of the Greek.  Another key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul's statements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul contrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the gospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great burden of Paul's life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go convert a bunch of people, then the \\\"Judizers\\\" would come along and try to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf Acts chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being saved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood of Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation for today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think \\\"faithfulness\\\" today has a meaning closer to what the original writers intended.   I think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is that God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not \\\"keep kosher\\\" to a kosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters of following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.   In the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and  be lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are  worse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in the parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in the one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that the price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.  [I agree with you in general, including the fact that \\\"pistis\\\" has some of the force of \\\"faithful\\\".  However if you take that too far, you can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have intended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say that we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we are saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that's not what you meant.  I have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that completely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I'd call a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and commitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic change.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show the new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any Christian there had better be the basic change in orientation that Jesus calls being born again.\",\"]Is it possible to do a \\\"wheelie\\\" on a motorcycle with shaft-drive?  yes. \",\"The following problem is really bugging me, and I would appreciate any help.

Please email, because our news is on the fritz (Note that this was posted via email).  Peter K.

I then have to click on the mouse button to actually place the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry  option the window appears right away, the properties specified by the -geometry argument. The question now is:  How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify window position with a mouseclick? I've tried explicitly setting window size and position, but that did alter the normal program behaviour.  Thanks for any hints ---> Robert  PS: I'm working in plain X.  \",\" You'd have to purify the river water first.  I'm not sure how practical that is with the Mississippi.  You'd better check with health agencies along the way to see if there are toxic chemicals in the river.  If it is just microorganisms, those can be filtered or killed, but you may need activated charcoal or other means to purify from chemicals. Better be same than sorry.  Obviously, drinking the river without processing it is likely to make you sick from bacteria and parasites. --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\"I have a 1986 Acura Integra 5 speed with 95,000 miles on it. It is positively the worst car I have ever owned. I had an 83 Prelude that had 160k miles on it when I sold it, and it was still going strong .  This is with religious attention to maintenance such as oil changes etc. Both cars were driven in exactly the same manner..    1. It has gone through two clutches (which are underrated.)   2. 3 sets of tires (really eats tires in the front even with careful align)   3. All struts started leaking about 25-30k miles   4. Windshield wiper motor burned up (service note on this one)   5. Seek stop working on radio about 20k miles   6. Two timing belts.   7. Constant error signals from computer.    8. And finally. A rod bearing went out on the No. 1 piston seriously damaging      the crankshaft, contaminating the engine etc. When the overhaul was done      last week it required new crankshaft, one new cam shaft (has two) because      the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it.

Here are the details of the car:  1958 Hardtop--Exterior condition:      Rocker panels rusted out at weld points, no rust at typical spots like      door hinge mounting points, back battery box, etc.  Missing front bumper,      front pan dented up, one weld popped in front.  This is for the most part      a solid, restorable automobile.       Interior Condition:      Missing original steering wheel, has one of the smaller aftermarket      wheels, seats need reupholstered, general fair condition.       Mechanical Condition:      Had been running, but now does not want to start...needs new rings (which      I have) also have extra parts such as complete long block, extra steering      shaft, etc.  For a car that has not been touched since 1958, it is in solid shape.

Almost a half million new users joined the Internet last year,     many of them are commercial businesses. The ban on commercial     use of Internet is no more.  Jack, there is a difference between using the network for commercial purposes and advertising in newsgroups.  Business communication is okay.  Advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet who have no desire to receive advertising is not okay.      Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only     by our innate good taste and no have no \\\"administrator\\\" to      guide(?) us.  I suspect that a site which generated a large volume of material not in anybody's good taste would find itself getting a lot of attention it didn't want.

You're constrained by the same rules that the rest of the users (many academic and military, who get irritable about a network for which they pay with tax and grant money carrying private business advertising) follow.  There are Secret Masters here, just like everywhere else.  They're not as obvious as the ones on Prodigy, but they're here.  No doubt at some point the Internet, like everything else, will become grotty enough to carry advertising.

The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age: in adults pneumococcus (the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia) is the most common cause, while in children Hemophilus influenzae is the most common cause.  What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis, which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in both groups, but with lower incidence in infants. This organism is also called the \\\"meningococcus\\\", and is the source of the common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in the press. Without prompt treatment (and even WITH it in some cases), the organism typically causes death within a day.   This organism, feared as it is, is actually grown from the throats of many normal adults. It can get to the meninges by different ways, but blood borne spread is probably the usual case.

We were   having intermittent problems with our mail at the time. Please excuse me   if you have seen this before...  Should Christians fight?  Last week Alastair posted some questions about fighting, and whether there   are such things as \\\"justifiable wars\\\". I have started looking into these   things and have jotted down my findings as I go. I haven't answered all   his questions yet, and I know what I have here is on a slightly different   tack, but possibly I'll be able to get into it more deeply later, and post   some more info soon.  Our duty to our neighbour:  Do good to all men (Gal 6:10) Love our neighbour as ourselves (Matt 22:39)  Act the part of the good Samaritan (Luke 10) toward any who may be in   trouble. We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured   man, and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes   people harm (even medical corps of the army etc).  Christians are by faith \\\"citizens of the commonwealth of Israel\\\"   (Ephesians 2:11-12), and also recognise that \\\"God rules in the kingdoms of   men\\\", and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles   of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith.  We are to be \\\"strangers and pilgrims\\\" amongst the nations, so we are just   passing through, and not part of any nation or any national aspirations   (this can also be applied to politics etc, but that's another story). We   are not supposed to \\\"strive\\\" or \\\"resist evil\\\" (even \\\"suffer yourselves to   be defrauded\\\") it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in   preserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up   God's kingdom.  Our duty to the state.  \\\"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's and unto God   the things which be God's\\\" (Luke 20:25). \\\"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power   but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth   the power, resisteth the ordinance of God\\\" (Rom 13:1-2). \\\"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether   it be to king as supreme... for so is the will of God that with well doing   ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men\\\" (1 Pet 2:13-15)  These scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a   divine command, but it is equally clear from Acts 5:19-29 that when any   ordinance of man runs counter to God's law, we must refuse submission to   it. The reason for this is that we are God's \\\"bond servants\\\" and His   service is our life's task. An example of the type of thing is in Col   3:22-23 where bondservants were to \\\"work heartily as unto the Lord\\\" - so   also we should work as if our boss was God - i.e. \\\"Pressed down, shaken   together, and running over\\\"... oops - a bit of a side track there...  In the contests between the nations, we are on God's side - a side that is   not fighting in the battle, but is \\\"testifying\\\" to the truth.  When we believe in God and embrace His promises, we become \\\"fellow   citizens with the Saints and of the Household of God\\\", and are no longer   interested in associations of the world. Think of this in relation to   unions etc as well. Paul tells us to \\\"lay aside every weight\\\" that we may   run \\\"the race that is set before us\\\", and if we are wise, we will discard   any association which would retard our progress - \\\"Thou therefore endure   hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth   himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath   chosen him to be a soldier\\\" (2 Tim 2:3-4).  One of these entanglements he warns about is \\\"be ye not unequally yoked   together with unbelievers\\\". One of the obvious applications of this is   marriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business   partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association   with any person or persons not believing the truth about God (in this case   the army). The principle comes from Deut 22:10 - remember that as well as   them being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one   unclean under the law. These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18   - I suggest you read this. The yoking also has another aspect - that of   servitude, and Jesus says \\\"take my yoke upon you\\\", so we are then yoked   with Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. We have already seen   that we are bondservants of Christ, and Paul says \\\"become not ye the   bondservants of men (1 Cor 7:23 RV).  An example from the Old Testament: the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2   \\\"Shouldest thou help the ungodly...?\\\". The situation here is a good   example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers.   Jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. Here are the facts: 1. He had made an affinity with Ahab, who had \\\"sold himself to work   wickedness before the Lord\\\" (1 Kings 21:25). 2. When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said   \\\"I am as thou art, my people as thy people\\\" (1 Kings 22:4) - an unequal   yoking. 3. He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted   on hearing the prophet of the Lord (trying to do the right thing), he   found that he was yoked and therefore couldn't break away from the evil   association he had made.  God says to us \\\"Come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not   the unclean thing, and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and   daughters\\\" (2 Cor 6:17).  This is more or less what I have found out so far - I'm still looking into   it, as I don't think I've answered all the questions raised by Alastair   yet. Heres a summary and a few things to think about:  The Christian in under command. Obedience to this command is an essential   factor in his relationship with Christ (John 15:10,14).  Total dedication to this course of action is required (Romans 12:1-2).  Disobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his   followers (1 Pet 2:7-8).  We are to be separated to God (Rom 6:4). This involves a master-servant   relationship (Rom 6:12,16).  No man can serve two masters (Matt 6:24,13,14).  All that is in the 'Kosmos' is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos (1   John 2:16). Christs kingdom is not of this world (i.e. not worldly in   nature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. If Christ is   our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom   was not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another   master.  Strangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to   anyone but God.  The servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 Tim 2:24) -   this does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout   our lives. There is a war to be waged, not with man's weapons (2 Cor   10:3-4), but with God's armour (Eph6:13-20).  I'll probably post some more when I've had time to look into things a bit   further. \",\"   I would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors (of the squeaky-clean, traditional crew-cut, talk to the AMA before starting any treatment, kind) who recommend treatments that, though \\\"accepted\\\", may not be necessary for the patient at the time.  And all for making a quick buck.  I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the U.S. is significantly inflated by these \\\"quacks of a different color\\\".  In fact, I'd say these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the true focus of the medical profession.  The AMA and the Boards should focus on these \\\"quacks\\\" instead of devoting unbelievable energy on 'search-and- destroy-missions' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non- traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients that traditional/accepted medicine cannot help.   *************************************************** Now to make a general comment on many recent posts: ***************************************************  Lately I've seen the word \\\"quack\\\" bandied about recklessly.  When a doctor or doctor-wanna-be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical subject in a civilized manner, all he/she has to do is say \\\"quack-quack\\\" and somehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over on their backs and pee-pee on themselves in obedience.  What do they teach you in medical school - how to throw your authority around?  Let me put it another way to make my point clear:  \\\"quack\\\" is a nebulous word lacking in any precision.  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand. The indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency;  and coming from any medical doctor (or wanna-be), where competency is expected, is real scary.

Namely, some Xlib operations work, and some do not.

This is the same anti-gun police chief that wanted full-auto Uzis for his patrol cars...).  Perhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago's finest, a close-to- 100% reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99% reliable automatic. I note that in Germany, where certainly the 9mm semi-auto handgun is king, some of the more elite police types want revolvers.  I don't think the issue is cost, because Chicago police certainly make on the order of at least $40K/year.

I did not clearly state it.    The most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational attitude.  Once one has accepted the _assumption_ that there is no god(s), and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their assumption(s) contradict your assumption, then I would say there's a lack of consistency here.  Now I know you'll get on me about faith.  If the _positive_ belief that God does not exist were a closed, logical argument, why do so many rational people have problems with that \\\"logic\\\"?

It might have appeared to attack atheism in general, but its point was that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons.  People will hate who they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it, be it cross or hammer&sickle.  The Stalin example _is_ important not only because it's still a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also because people really did love him and his ideas, even after all that he had wrought.   First, all the pink crows/unicorns/elves arguments in the world will not sway most people, for they simply do not accept the analogy.  Why?  One of the big reasons is that many, many people want something beyond this life.  You can pretend that they don't want this, but I for one can accept it and even want it myself sometimes.  And there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a God. Can love as a truth be proven, logically?    John the Baptist boasted of Jesus to many people.  I find it hard to see how that behavior is arrogant at all.  Many Christians I know also boast in this way, but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance.  Of course, I do know arrogant Christians, doctors, and teachers as well.  Technically, you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant, Jesus, for instance.   I speak against strong atheism.  I also often find that the evidence supporting a faith is very subjective, just as, say, the evidence supporting love as truth is subjective.

I never would have expected him in the #1 spot.  It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points higher in both leagues than any other year.  Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.  Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell :->.  The other elite fielders in the league.  This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average. His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  Add another to the elite fielders list.  Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low 1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988 (best year ever) brings his average up a lot.  Strange last two years.  According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base. But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).  Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.  Last year -- a fluke or a portent?  Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?  Brook  is declining.  Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third.  Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about 10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.  Moving back to second was a good idea.  So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.  Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.  Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.  Not a good fielder.  Both are better off at shortstop.  Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to have helped his fielding any.

It is its own OS, with (Billy Gates assures us) true  multi-tasking/multithreading, meets DOD security specs, will run win3.1  programs as well as DOS programs, has multi-processor support, and is primarily a Server program.  It's overhead is too high for it to be economical for most users.  Speaking of overhead, it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM.   It iwll run with 12, but that's like running OS/2 2.0 with 4 megs.  And that's  just to run it.

It is, like NT, a true OS with thrue  multitasking and multithreading, but has much smaller hardware requirements,  and does not meet DOD security specs (but that's okay since it will probably  be more of a client OS).  there are a few otehr differences, but those are the  main ones.  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August.  The Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro$oft are in intense  competition, so it is said.  However, I think a different relationship will  arise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology), Chicogo will be the  client machine.  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together,  partly because Chicogo is just a small NT (think of it that way, anyway).   (Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS, so don't scorn the concept.)  Anyway, don't expect it soon.  Windows 4 and DOS 7 are supposed to be  released next year (read: see it in 95), so I expect that Chicogo won't be out  til '96.

Please accept this as a serious attempt to foster dialog and rest assurred that I make every attempt to make fun of no one, except myself ;-)]    [...]    Hmmm.  There are other animals on this planet with advanced  mental facilities which have not developed \\\"religion\\\" as a  satisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?   Further, it appears that only humans have a \\\"need\\\" to explain the  unexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet,  including those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly  content in their ignorance.   I'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me  from your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal  *only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need  not be researched; 3) religion was \\\"made up\\\" by humans to address a  perceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that  is, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical  structure with biology at the apex).   Needless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the  underlying presuppositions.    I disagree that Christianity is \\\"an infectious cult\\\".  It has  certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in  spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.  That it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is  \\\"infectious\\\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides  a workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this  is the case).   I disagree that Christianity is \\\"a safety blanket\\\" which supplants  hope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one  Source of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a  Christian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to  you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose  and externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of  control over one's own life the problem or is it something else?   Finally, one does not appropriate \\\"eternal happiness\\\" by following  Christian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance  of Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people  from their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the  Christian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian  in the Person of God's Spirit.   Heaven is one of two final states that  Christian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally  not motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this  promised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived  benefits to them in the here-and-now.    Many Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a  priority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this  as a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate  priority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,  convert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).  Rather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting  the opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits  of a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful  that it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask  \\\"Why?\\\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-  plished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it  does not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian  is required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of  friendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot  evaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or  harm others if the sole purpose of being a \\\"friend\\\" is to gain a  conversion).   As a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-  ticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \\\"hurry-up\\\"  attitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no  conversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was  coerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open  to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).  The Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings  conviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part  (witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.    We are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die  just as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more  than this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is  so limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find  a more expansive view.   (For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing  arts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language  of other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?  How is it that humans can organize themselves in various social  structures whereas other animals have only one structure?)    Blatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.  Christianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not  a *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship  with a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-  knit relationship with this appelation.    There are \\\"Jesus freaks\\\" who let the emotional aspects of worship  and Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,  this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these  things flow.    Guilty by association?  That \\\"christianity\\\" which forces itself  upon another is not Christianity at all.    You appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened  2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?   I cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus' influence was a sole  result of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years  gone by this time.  It strains the bounds of credulity to assert  that nothing about Jesus' life was noteworthy _until_ the sack.    Christianity is having a relationship with Jesus Christ Himself.

The Woman is the Church.  Catholics have always called our Church \\\"Holy Mother Church\\\" and our \\\"Mother.\\\"  An example would be from St. Cyprian of Carthage, who wrote in 251 AD, \\\"Can anyone have God for his Father, who does not have the Church for his mother?\\\"  Hence the image of the Church as a woman, holding a Cross and a Cup, which tell of the Crucifxition of Our Lord, and of the power of His Blood (the grail legend, but also, more significantly, it shows that \\\"This is the Cup of the New Covenant in my blood, which shall be shed for you and for many.\\\" (Luke 22.20), the Cup represents the New Covenant and holds the blood of redemption).  The fact that the woman is holding both and is said to have the whole world for her seat, is that the Catholic Church is catholic, that is universal, and is found throughout the world, and the Church shows the Crucifixtion and applies the blood of redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers, thorugh which the Holy Sacrafice of the Mass, can be said and celebrated in all the nations as Malachi predicted in Malachi 1.11, \\\"From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is great among the gentiles, and everywhere there is sacrafice, and there is offered to my Name a clean oblation, for my Name is great among the gentiles, says the Lord of hosts.\\\"  And so we acknowledge what St. Paul wrote \\\"For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death until he comes.\\\" (1 Corinthians 11.26)   You are quite right about the identification of \\\"Babylon the Great, Mother of all Harlots\\\" with Rome.

Was DS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front DS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?  No. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when (forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing. The first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max Friz's famous design, but with an overhead \\\"point cam\\\" (see below for more on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground clearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so that the ground clearance was substantially increased:         ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)                  Viking motor (front) ->   \\\\=@=/  This is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved around a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn in the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting rods to accomodate the stroke.  The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still unique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and and extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was required to drive both overhead valves.  Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a pressurized stream of oil to power the \\\"waterwheel\\\" which kept the lobe spinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal engineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to normal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random, resulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the beast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to pressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however, uses an electric oil pump. Wimps).  Despite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This was feasible because it was a racing engine.  With just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers because of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an almost perfect point:                      /\\\\                    /()\\\\   <-lobe                   / XX \\\\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to  valvestems ->   / \\\\  / \\\\    complexity)                 |  |   | |                 |  |===| |                     =0=  <---piston                      |                              Note that the tip was not truly vertical                              (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the                              ground, and this drawing doesn't show the                              curvature because there was none in the                              head itself.

Thus, the name.  The Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it worked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary technology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that racing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines were raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate (approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two Springers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and down that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern record of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle historians discount this story.

Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Note for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a single staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3 scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is  currently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale  experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.  On April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled  \\\"Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions\\\" here at the University of Illinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is not directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with  them recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used  the DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the details of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope they aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.  The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The main restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I did not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters and 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in  mid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson showed the following plot of acceleration vs time:                   ______ 3 G         /|   /      |            / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly            /  | /        |    good.  The big difference is that the lines 2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are         /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as        /                |          the graph wasn't up for very long. 1 G   /                 |                         |                         | 0 G                     |               ^          ^            ~100 sec    ~400 sec   As mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below 3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the accelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are  throtled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in  accelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines bring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut out entirely.  The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed for an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of air drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to  that desired.  Questions from the audience:  (paraphrased)  Q:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than     all at once?  A:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.  Q:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?  A:  Can't tell us.  \\\"Read Aviation Leak.\\\"  He also apparently had a good      propulsion example, but was told not to use it.    My question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting national security or MD protecting their own interests?  The second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch up maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and  the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs of heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar, and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate. The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have about 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about  60 degrees south latitude.  I would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about that aspect of the flight profile. \",\"   Depends. If you assume the existance of a working SSTO like DC, on billion $$ would be enough to put about a quarter million pounds of stuff on the moon. If some of that mass went to send equipment to make LOX for the transfer vehicle, you could send a lot more. Either way, its a lot more than needed.  This prize isn't big enough to warrent developing a SSTO, but it is enough to do it if the vehicle exists.    Allen \",\"What an exciting thread (finally!)  Mitra is Sanskrit for Friend, as such He started out as an avatar of Lord Visnu  mentioned first in the Vedas. Later he seems to have risen to chief prominence  worshipped by the Persians. Associated with the Sun but NOT the Sun, he is  the lord of contract honor and obedience, therefore naturally worshipped by  soldiers. He was ordered by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and He reluct-  antly agreed because of His obligation...the blood of that bull spilled and  grew all earth life...then Mitra and the Sun sat down to eat.  Worship of Lord Mitra ended in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians.  Hundreds of years later He was rediscovered and thrown into the Official Roman  Pantheon (tm) for some semi-tricky reason, I forget why. But all references of  Him ended abruptly when He was stricken from same, so apparently His worship  was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy, like membership  in the Communist Party was in the Soviet Bloc. The sociology of religion in  ancient times is fascinating!  Oh, His B-day was 25 Dec. Ahem.  I am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after His was booted from the  Roman Imperial God Roster or what. It contained mostly soldiers, with 7 levels  of initiation. They worshipped underground in caverns in pews. The bull horns  in those temples were for scaring away or impaling evil spirits, I'm not sure  that they had Mithraic significance or not.  I don't know that the ritual meal was of a cannibalistic nature as is the  Christian masses. But eating deities goes way back to Old Kingdom Egypt.  Someone mentioned bullfighting. Did Mithraists sacrifice bulls? I forget. More  likely, for a religious source, might be the shower of bull's blood enjoyed  by the worshippers of Cybele on the Day of Blood? Cybele worship extended all  throughout even up to France bigtime.\",\" yo,yo,yo . the western digital hd will hve it marked either s,m,a put jumper on the s \\\"its printed on the circuitry underkneth it.  hope i helped i had the same problem. bye.. later daze. oharad@wanda.waiariki.ac.nz \",\" The willingness of the majority of the people to give up their freedom in  exchange for a sense of safety is hardly limited to the USA, and is an  endemic problem in any human society of any appreciable size.  The structure  of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but  fighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have  comfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't really have the former,  in the long term, unless you have the latter.  One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird  cross between a libertarian and an \\\"establishment tool\\\" is that I end up  taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when  the government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my  lifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.    As a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government  to be \\\"fair\\\".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed,  whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the  government would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem.   What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal,  so much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong)  sense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth  it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its  citizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the  major architects of the American system of government, figured that in a  couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it  would be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.  I  agree, and while I don't go around trying to spark one, I'll certainly  participate if it happens when I'm around.  There is a reason I am such a  strong supporter of individual rights while being so cynical about politics.   I've already written off politics.  And yes, this may get me in trouble some day.

From the description of ad here, it sounds like they're talking about \\\"High Power Rocketry\\\", an outgrowth of model rocketry.  This hobby uses non-metallic structural compoments and commerically manufactured engines ranging in impulse classification from G to P.  The hobby has been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular. Technically this is not consider amateur rocketry.  Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds OR using a total impulse of G or greater, REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch. Typically, a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified period of time (ie week, weekend, etc.) at a designated site and time, and all of the launches are then covered under this \\\"blanket waiver\\\". There is also a \\\"High Power Safety Code\\\" which designates more specific rules such as launch field size, etc.  Finally, in order to purchase any of the larger (Class B) rocket  motors you need to certified through either the National Association of Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association. Certification procedures require a demonstarted handling and \\\"safe\\\" flight at a total impulse level.

Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question, because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000.  Basically, there are a number of functions with prototypes set up in, let's say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the composite widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type :   typedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget)  but in several places in the HP source code, they reference the insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just one, as the prototype suggests.

So, does anyone have any suggestions as to how to turn off this checking in GCC, or how I can go about changing the code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h, or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions.

Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and commercial space.  This is how it went...    After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO, I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard the gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour. Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.  We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide, who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not bozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to  make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.  Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking to him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening. We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.   Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another woman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that we brought up.  But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate aligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space. So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to LEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming  feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that. We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism paper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog over L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is  more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to  understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education  whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other fields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday  would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.  We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal communicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided in those sectors.  Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc.. We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.  We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order to make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.  We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are proceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the results from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan), and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along the lines of lowering the cost to LEO.  In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data  Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it. He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it, and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually happen immediatly there.  The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they could feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know the answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who really did know the answers.  Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He said that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this would be something that she would be very interested in, although they do have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the state 1 week out of 6 these days.  All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\",\" Right.

The Bible \\\"ends\\\" with the book of Revelations. But does God's reign end there ? No. So who can say for sure that God's messages are either no longer happening or still happening ?  I can now hear the clamor for proof. 8-) With the cold response I've gotten from the past from this group, it's very hard to get the point across. I'll only go over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look at documents stored somewhere. I've cited the uncorrupted bodies of saints before. They're still there. 8-) The apparitions at Fatima, Portugal culminated in a miracle specifically granted to show God's existence. That was the spinning/descending of the sun. It was seen in several countries. That event is \\\"approved\\\" by the Pope. Currently, images of Mary in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Philippines, Africa are showing tears (natural or blood). These are still under investigation by the Church. But realize that investigations take decades to finish. And if the message is Christ will come in ten days, that's a bit too late, isn't it 8-). Other events under investigation are inner locutions (\\\"coming to know\\\"), stigmata (the person exhibits Christ's wounds. And they don't heal. And doctor's don't know why). Non-believers are welcome to pore through documents, I'm sure.  This stuff is not like Koresh. Or Oral Roberts (give me $5M or God will call me home). It's free. Find out why they're happening (as we ourselves are studying why). If anybody can figure this out, tell us ! You can be of any religion. If you have the resources, go to one of the countries I mentioned. These are not \\\"members only\\\" events. God and Mary invites  everybody.  So in conclusion (finally) ... We RC's believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary. We are scared to death sometimes although we're told not to. There are more proofs and events. And that is why \\\"not everything is in the Bible\\\". Although in a lot of the apparitions, we are told to read the Bible.  As far as the Protestant vs. Catholics issue is concerned... In the end, God's churches will unite. I'm not sure how. I have some idea. But the point is we shouldn't worry about the \\\"versus\\\" part. Just do God's work. That's all that matters. Unity will come.  BTW, I'm just a plain person. I'm not the Pope's spokesperson. But I am RC.  -- \",\" OK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.  We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is, is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of us who have bikes are familiar.  Let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its own, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to get rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches to transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to remain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike, through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the same way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along  a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change  surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact  patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It  probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice,  but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like  because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a  better way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch forces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface. You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it was the rotation that did it.  Looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple. Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them about the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels. How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not sideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski or skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels. I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like that, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect. Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try one of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very much like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn. So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's, a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have countersteering.  Conclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have motorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what real effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations of how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm  willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering.   If you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's behaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.\",\":Thanks for all your assistance.

Uranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb.  Right now, there are mines closing because they can't compete with places like Cigar Lake in Canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards to the mines, who work in shielded vehicles).  Plenty of other sources (for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before uranium reached $200/lb.  \\\"Demand and supply balance will collapse\\\" is nonsense.  Supply and demand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century? Not bloody likely.

Thanks!\",\"  I got the univesa driver available over the net. I thought that finally my 1-meg oak board would be able to show 680x1024 256 colors. Unfortunately a program still says that I can't do this. Is it the fault of the program (fractint) or is there something wrong with my card.  univesa- a free driver available over the net that makes many boards vesa compatible.  \",\" The Fujitsu 2322 uses what is known as an 'SMD' interface (Storage Module Device?).  A lot of older minis used it.  Sun still does on their server models.  There are several different speeds of SMD, and I think that the  Fuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec (thats megabits).  There used to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase in Texas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up. Controllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses though.  Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available, but I think that it was designed for slower SMD devices.  In other words, if you have a PC or Mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat.

Xt Glossary ----------------------------------------------------------------------  o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code   to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with   this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,   RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,   etc.  The terms \\\"Xt\\\" and \\\"Intrinsics\\\" are used interchangeably,   however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X   window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,   Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the   Intrinsics are not especially useful.  o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The   precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It   is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the   Object class although these are more accurately called windowless   widgets or gadgets.  o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below   the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib   functions because Xt provides most such services although an   understanding of Xlib helps with problems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  In brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for critical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the appropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a list traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.  The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the interrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous to add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never be called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop about the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal. However, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.  Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.          Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4.  How do I use a different visual than the default? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has three things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and border pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap resource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions deals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen and DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is not properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is created.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends on the visual being used.    How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier because the basic information you need is available.  The first is a little harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the needed information.  /*  * Some sample code to start up an application using something other  * than the default visual.  *  * To compile:  * cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm  *  * To run:  * ./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow  *  * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap  * to install.  */  #include <X11/Intrinsic.h> #include <X11/StringDefs.h> #include <X11/Shell.h>  typedef struct {  Visual *visual;  int depth; } OptionsRec;  OptionsRec Options;  XtResource resources[] = {  {\\\"visual\\\", \\\"Visual\\\", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *),  XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL},  {\\\"depth\\\", \\\"Depth\\\", XtRInt, sizeof (int),  XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL}, };  XrmOptionDescRec Desc[] = {  {\\\"-visual\\\", \\\"*visual\\\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL},  {\\\"-depth\\\", \\\"*depth\\\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL} };    int main (argc, argv)  int  argc;  char  **argv; {  XtAppContext app;  /* the application context */  Widget  top;  /* toplevel widget */  Display  *dpy;  /* display */  char  **xargv; /* saved argument vector */  int  xargc;  /* saved argument count */  Colormap colormap; /* created colormap */  XVisualInfo vinfo;  /* template for find visual */  XVisualInfo *vinfo_list; /* returned list of visuals */  int  count;  /* number of matchs (only 1?) */  Arg  args[10];  Cardinal cnt;  char  *name = \\\"test\\\";  char  *class = \\\"Test\\\";   /*   * save the command line arguments   */   xargc = argc;  xargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *));  bcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));   /*   * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can   * retrieve the appropriate visual resource.   */  cnt = 0;  top = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv,           (String *) NULL, args, cnt);  dpy = XtDisplay (top);  cnt = 0;  XtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources,        XtNumber (resources),        args, cnt);  cnt = 0;  if (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top)))  {   XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt;   /*    * Now we create an appropriate colormap.  We could    * use a default colormap based on the class of the    * visual; we could examine some property on the    * rootwindow to find the right colormap; we could    * do all sorts of things...    */   colormap = XCreateColormap (dpy,          RootWindowOfScreen (XtScreen (top)),          Options.visual,          AllocNone);   XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNcolormap, colormap); ++cnt;    /*    * Now find some information about the visual.    */   vinfo.visualid = XVisualIDFromVisual (Options.visual);   vinfo_list = XGetVisualInfo (dpy, VisualIDMask, &vinfo, &count);   if (vinfo_list && count > 0)   {    XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNdepth, vinfo_list[0].depth);    ++cnt;    XFree ((XPointer) vinfo_list);   }  }  XtDestroyWidget (top);    /*   * Now create the real toplevel widget.   */  XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNargv, xargv); ++cnt;  XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNargc, xargc); ++cnt;  top = XtAppCreateShell ((char *) NULL, class,     applicationShellWidgetClass,     dpy, args, cnt);   /*   * Display the application and loop handling all events.   */  XtRealizeWidget (top);  XtAppMainLoop (app);  return (0); }  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 5.  Which visual should an application use? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to be specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your application probably falls into the category of always using the default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular visual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some such).  Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server allocates resources I may not always want your application to run in TrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may be very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor or just monochrome.  As an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different possible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static color, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above  plus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that shell.  A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have its own realize method to use the visual when it calls XCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be obtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A reasonable value is probably XtNvisual.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This is interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen() and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e. it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.  If the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies colormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the visual.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This was especially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  See section 2.8 of the Xt specification.  It eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The Intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed. It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any pending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned up before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then performed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have completed, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the list is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among other things.  As some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the Intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the widgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs immediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not destroyed until returning to the outer event loop.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting an application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget may not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open sockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):    Widget  ToplevelGet (gw)   Widget  gw;  /* widget to find toplevel */  {   Widget  top;    for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))    /* empty */;   return (top);  }   void  ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)   Widget  gw;  /* widget */   XtPointer closure; /* data the app specified */   XtPointer call_data; /* widget specific data */  {   Widget  toplevel;    toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);   XtUnmapWidget (toplevel); /* make it disappear quickly */   XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);   exit (0);  }  One can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying the toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never occur.    This works for most widgets and most applications but will not work for those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant of the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the widget may change and someday require that some external state is cleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.  One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and difficult to maintain practices.  Try the following code instead.   #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>   extern Widget ToplevelGet (  #if NeedFunctionPrototypes   Widget  gw  #endif  );   extern Boolean ExitWorkProc (  #if NeedFunctionPrototypes   XtPointer closure  #endif  );   extern void ExitCallback (  #if NeedFunctionPrototypes   Widget  gw,   XtPointer closure,   XtPointer call_data  #endif  );   Widget  ToplevelGet (gw)  Widget  gw;  /* widget to find toplevel */  {   Widget  top;    for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))    /* empty */;   return (top);  }    void  ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)  Widget  gw;  /* widget */  XtPointer closure; /* data the app specified */  XtPointer call_data; /* widget specific data */  {   Widget  toplevel;    toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);   XtUnmapWidget (toplevel); /* make it disappear quickly */   XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);   XtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),       ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);  }   Boolean  ExitWorkProc (closure)   XtPointer closure;  {   exit (0);   /*NOTREACHED*/  }   ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the application is next idle -- which happens after all the events are processed and the destroy callbacks are executed.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. How do I resize a Shell widget? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  After it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper thing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget using XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the Shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the request.  However, the Shell must have the resource XtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the window manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.  To change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not the child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  It does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does not fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not block, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to block.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For a file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF -- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to be read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based OS's it is the poll() system call.  How to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use another process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe to connect the application with this other process and pass the file descriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on BSD systems is \\\"tail -f filename\\\".  It's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_ reliable.  In particular:   - IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while    (several thousand times) and then stop until some other    event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race    condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.   - Pyramid, doesn't work at all.   - Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as    sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing    side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it    all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at    a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks    (get raound it by detecting the situation and having    select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had    been given the whole block).   Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as read(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and may not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with part of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this point I don't know.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  I have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full details of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already familiar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may not find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, which means its a 1000 pages.  Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., \\\"X Window System Toolkit, The  Complete Programmer's Guide and Specification\\\", Digital Press,  1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by  Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC  Direct at 1-800-DIGITAL.  The other book I commonly recomend to novices is:  Young, Doug. \\\"The X Window System: Applications and Programming with  Xt (Motif Version),\\\" Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8).  (ISBN 0-13-972167-3)  And of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt. O'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt reference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively overhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding it very useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related information.  I read two periodicals, \\\"The X Resource\\\" and the \\\"The X Journal\\\". These are the only two dealing specifically with X.  \\\"The X Resource\\\" is published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being the MIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no advertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  For orders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorial matters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted at math.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in ~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.   \\\"The X Journal\\\" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising. The articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical audience.  I read it more to see what's going on then with an expectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a fairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty good collection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call (908) 563-9033.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 14. What Widgets are available? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  There are three popular widget sets:  Athena - The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most    purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is    available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z. Motif - From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on    many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but    Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think    it is poorly implemented. OLIT - The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets    implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by    AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.    I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.  In addition the following collection of widgets are also available:  Xtra - a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software    Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked    bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,    spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen    them so I can't comment. FWF - The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of    freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,    FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets    can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine    a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z. Xcu - The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the    early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for    buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so    widely used. Xs - The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but    seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise. Xw - The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written    for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.    Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.    The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was    originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided    much experience for the designers of Xt. Xo - A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you    can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*  The following specialized widgets are also available:  Tbl - Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif    widgets as children.  Part of Wcl. Plots - The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).    Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there? ----------------------------------------------------------------------   __________________________________________  Name  Language Vendor  __________________________________________  Xview  C  Sun  OI  C++  ParcPlace  Interviews C++  Stanford  Tcl/tk  C  sprite.berkeley.edu  __________________________________________   However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and implementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop in the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language other than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  First, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)  typdef struct  {       String name;      long value;  } Arg;  and the code:  Arg arg;   XtSetArg (arg, \\\"name\\\", 3.2)  expands to  Arg arg;   arg.name = \\\"name\\\";  arg.value = 3.2;  you can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value gets the integer \\\"3\\\" instead of the floating point value \\\"3.2\\\".  When the value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is wildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So, how to get around this?  The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now recomending it over the previous suggestions.  #define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\\\     if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\\\         XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\\\     } else { \\\\         XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\\\         XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\\\     }   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. How do I write a resource converter? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Courtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):  The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5) Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow for destructors and caching of converted values.  There are several main types of resource converters:      string to data type     data type to string     data type to data type  i) string to data type     Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings     that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often     used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:   Name  Value  \\\"True\\\"  1  \\\"False\\\"  0      In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare     the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most     readily accomplished by the use of the \\\"quark\\\" mechanism of the     resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,     which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a     single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the     quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.      If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many     converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then     a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the     resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of     these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks     and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one     of the converters.  ii) data type to string     This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data     type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,     the data type value is simply converted to a string value,     probably by the use of sprintf.      Data type to string converters are useful for applications that     wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that     they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This     mechanism can be used to provide a \\\"snapshot\\\" of application state     into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to     a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.      If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type     converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to     string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure     that they are consistent.  iii) data type to data type     This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type     value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be     converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for     red, green and blue.   The type signature for a resource converter is as follows:  typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,  XrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);     Display *dpy;     XrmValuePtr args;     Cardinal *num_args;     XrmValuePtr fromVal;     XrmValuePtr toVal;     XtPointer *converter_data;  When the converter is invoked, the \\\"fromVal\\\" argument points to the source X resource manager value and the \\\"toVal\\\" argument points to the destination X resource manager value.  The \\\"converter_data\\\" argument is an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified when the converter is registered.  The \\\"args\\\" and \\\"num_args\\\" arguments allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is invoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the Pixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.  Care must be taken with the \\\"toVal\\\" argument.  An XrmValue has the following type definition and specifies a size and location for a converted value:  typedef struct {     unsigned int    size;     caddr_t         addr; } XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;  When the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of the given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL. In the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the destination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If the destination area is not large enough, then the converter should set the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the converter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply copy the converted value into the space given and return True.  If the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to the address of a static variable containing the converted value and return True.  When writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it becomes convenient to define a macro:      #define DONE(var, type) \\\\       if (toVal->addr) \\\\  { \\\\    if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\\      { \\\\        toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\        return False; \\\\      } \\\\    else \\\\      *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\\  } \\\\       else \\\\  toVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\\\       toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\       return True;      #define DONESTR(str) \\\\       if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\\  { \\\\    toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\    return False; \\\\  } \\\\       else \\\\  toVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\\\       toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\       return True;  Inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety checking on the \\\"num_args\\\" and \\\"args\\\" arguments to ensure that your converter is being called properly.  Once you have written your converter, you need to register it with the Intrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.  To register a converter with a single application context, use XtAppSetTypeConverter:  void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,  cache, destructor)     XtAppContext context;     String from;     String to;     XtTypeConverter converter;     XtConvertArgList args;     Cardinal num_args;     XtCacheType cache;     XtDestructor destructor;  To register a converter with all application contexts, use XtSetTypeConverter:  void XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,  cache, destructor)     String from;     String to;     XtTypeConverter converter;     XtConvertArgList args;     Cardinal num_args;     XtCacheType cache;     XtDestructor destructor;  In the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and XtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter and XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be used.  When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a \\\"cache\\\" argument specifies how converted resource values are to be cached:      XtCacheNone  Don't cache any converted values     XtCacheAll  Cache all converted values     XtCacheByDisplay Cache converted values on a per display basis  Caching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a good idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).  The \\\"destructor\\\" argument is a routine that is invoked then the resource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is being destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:  typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,  XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);     XtAppContext context;     XrmValuePtr to;     XtPointer converter_data;     XrmValuePtr args;     Cardinal *num_args;  The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated with the \\\"to\\\" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed to by the \\\"to\\\" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the conversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments for the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to free the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private data passed in when the converter was registered.  Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT R5 distribution:      mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c     contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c     contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. How do I open multiple displays? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  See \\\"Multi-user Application Software Using Xt\\\", The X Resource, Issue 3, (Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues involved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a nutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_ application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display and remove it from the application context.  The real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can happen 3 ways:  1. User selects a \\\"quit\\\" button on one of the displays,  2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,  3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,     server shutdown/crash, or network failure.  I'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a problem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that display.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.  The third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the Oliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult problem.  The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O error is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true for a single display X based application, but not true for a multiple display program or an application that does things other than display information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the I/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit() happens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid returning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment demonstrates this:  #include <setjmp.h> jmp_buf XIOrecover;  void XIOHandler (dpy)  Display  *dpy; {  destroyDisplay (dpy);  longjmp (XIOrecover, 1); }  main () {  ...  if (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)   XSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);  XtAppMainLoop (app_context); }  The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go back to the application specific data and perform any necessary cleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().  For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is first called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the jmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to the same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value of this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to longjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this purpose it is adequate.  Some other problems you might run into are resource converters that improperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors such as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical value.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to connect to a display.  There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in November of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically said this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 19.

Where are the resources loaded from? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places (from highest priority to lowest priority):   1. Args passed at creation time.  2. Command line arguments.  3. User's per host defaults file  4. User's defaults file.  5. User's per application default file.  6. System wide per application default file.  Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result of steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.  The per host defaults file contains customizations for all applications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either specified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.  The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program \\\"xrdb\\\" is used to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the display must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is reasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER but most do not.  A user may have many per application default files containing customizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.  The system wide per application default files are typically found in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the fallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.  [Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]  You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.  Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located):   setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N  The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see XtResolvePathname()):   %N The value of the filename parameter, or the   application's class name.  %T The value of the file \\\"type\\\".  In this case, the   literal string \\\"app-defaults\\\"  %C customization resource (R5 only)  %S Suffix.  None for app-defaults.  %L Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \\\"ja_JP.EUC\\\")  %l Language part of %L  (e.g. \\\"ja\\\")  %t The territory part of the display's language string  %c The codeset part of the display's language string  Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is \\\"Myterm\\\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm  $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm  As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.  Let's consider another example. This time, let's set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.   setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N  The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,       for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is       defined so %T and %S are useless.  With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization resource value.  For example, you might run the \\\"myterm\\\" application like this:   myterm -xrm \\\"*customization: -color\\\"  If one of your pathname specifications had the value \\\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C\\\" then the expanded pathname would be \\\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\\\" because the %C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource.  The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:    /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N  (Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings.)  The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is     <root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   <root>/%L/%N:\\\\   <root>/%l/%N:\\\\   <root>/%N:  <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.  Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to \\\".\\\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \\\"./\\\", a dot followed by a slash.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. What order are callbacks executed in? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)  The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to modify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one currently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot guarantee the order of execution.  The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have; therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the list.  Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback    \\\"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the   procedure is to be appended.\\\"   you may not infer from the word \\\"appended\\\" that the callback routines are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback list.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 22. How do I know if a widget is visible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)   Right, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a \\\"deficiency\\\" in the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the protocol.  (The \\\"deficiency\\\" is that the information is available in one way, in this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section carefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.  A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from viewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped; that is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency. Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol; see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.   You'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.   As an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action routine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget which contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the map_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are suggestions.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  You can't.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc() tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is handled something like:   ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))  if (!ptr)  {   perror (\\\"malloc in xyzzy()\\\");   exit (1)  } To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions XtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which all use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and realloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.  In addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses XtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:   if (!ptr)   ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));  else   ptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));  ++count;  to be written as:   ptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);  Also, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I've found the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'm allocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so I can fully recover from not enough memory errors.  XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a structure or copying a string:     struct abc *xyzzy;    char      *ptr;    char      *str = \\\"abcdef\\\";     xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc); /* takes care of type casting */    ptr = XtNewString (str);  A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with malloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:    char       *ptr;    ptr = XtMalloc (100);   /* ... */   free (ptr);  may not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did this broken and complain to the vendor.  A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string when they should really be using XmStringFree().  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. How to debug an Xt application? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First, I'd recomend getting \\\"purify\\\" from Pure Software.  This is a great package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey at $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb (contact support@pure.com for more info).   Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into  the object code produced by existing compilers.  These  instructions check every memory read and write performed by  the program under test and detect several types of access  errors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past  malloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts  checking logic into all of the code in a program, including  third party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies  system call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory  usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel  adaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly  comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program  down typically by a factor of two to five.  An alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on many Unix's and has pretty similar features is \\\"The SENTINEL Debugging Environment\\\".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library functions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com for more info)  Next, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run in synchronous mode, easily accomplished with the \\\"-sync\\\" command line argument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then set a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the original Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous mode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to Xlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the server are asynchronous.  Next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the undocumented resource \\\"xtIdentifyWindows\\\" or the class resource \\\"XtDebug\\\" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window. For example:      example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &     example% xwininfo -tree       <click in new xload window>  will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each window is included.  This can help for checking the location and size of errant widgets.  Next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to test the way a widget manages it's children, you can try export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour of both.  It's a very clever idea.  The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from a pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to go to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands. Unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to your application which is stopped.  The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on your desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment) on one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly using a command sequence like this:   othermachine% xhost +thismachine  thismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;  thismachine% gdb application # Your favorite debugger.  or this:  othermachine% xhost +thismachine  thismachine% gdb application  (gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0  (gdb) run ...  I believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method of dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to release any grabs during breakpoints.  Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and knowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing the internals of a particular widget but not very far without understanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great deal.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work? ----------------------------------------------------------------------    I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,    XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when    I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.    I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works    perfect, but in my \\\"real\\\" application nothing happens.   The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those routines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is they use a default application context different then the one you may have created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per application context basis and you are using two application contexts, you won't get those events.  For example:   ...  cnt = 0;  toplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,        Desc, XtNumber (Desc),        &argc, argv,        Fallback, args, cnt);   XtAddTimeOut (...)  XtAddWorkProc (...)   XtAppMainLoop (app)  would never invoke the timeout.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)  Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an ``intuitive'' fashion.  Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has supported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with each other, and so far as I know, they are not published.  I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public protocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to support a \\\"standard\\\" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop and contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long as it is based on Xt).  The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM conventions, for more details read the code.  I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that it works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif anyway.  The latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from netcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.  A (possibly older) version is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib.\",\"QUESTION:   What is the EXACT entry (parameter and syntax please), in the X-Terminal configuration file (loaded when the X-Terminal boots), to add another system  to the TCP/IP access control list?

(i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the  low gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and  would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's  another curve approaching)  3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is  depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern  electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.  this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about  to turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as  little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.  also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a 5 speed)?    how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do better.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear, low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high revs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight. \",\" You're obviously not referring to any of the three above-quoted individuals, because barnacles don't each send $20 to the crew of the ship to keep it moving.  \\\"Get the organization to act on it\\\" is easy to say, but says little about what one really can and should do.

If you check the THN stats for Kansas City, you'll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having played in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the 4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible.   Well, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isn't quite accurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing, which was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because he knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which point he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks and he disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not reporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as injured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped him down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly not with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a no-no).  Very nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was hurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably another expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of his career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players motivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a bad judgement call.     Always gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but hustle isn't always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me one night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to hold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto's neck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turned around and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter wasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.  The Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbie McDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me \\\"you have to make room for the kids\\\". Carter, in fact, refused to report to K.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto retirement, but I haven't heard anything official. His only hope in hockey now is the Gulls.    Because, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked fairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I didn't think he was quite ready to make the jump to the NHL.

Only one blinker is used.  Note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the string 1 bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs in parallel with it.  That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing and the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open, this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the strings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.   Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get one.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these draw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.  What you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light  at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current  from the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing  both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a  low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow  at reduced brightness. \",\"Cloak yourself in God's sustaining and abiding love.

What it means is that parties aren't dragged into court over and over again because the losing side \\\"discovers\\\" some \\\"new\\\" evidence.  I don't know about you, Brett, but I suspect GM had the resources to find just about as many expert and fact witnesses as it wanted before the trial started.  Letting them re-open the case now is practically an invitation to every civil litigant on earth to keep an ace in the hole in case the verdict goes against him.  BTW, in federal criminal cases, Rule 33 does permit a motion for a new trial \\\"based on . . . *newly discovered* evidence\\\" if made within 2 years of the verdict.  (Emphasis mine.)  If you're trying to make a backhanded point about criminal justice in a discussion that has little to do with criminal trials -- as the estimable David Brock did in his amusing WSJ piece last week -- save your breath.     Yup.  Which is why they shoulda been brought around the first time through.     Unless there's some reason to believe that this supposed bias predated the trial (as opposed to being a product of it), and that GM was unfairly prevented from discovering it (by venireman concealment or otherwise), why should GM be allowed to complain? \",\"Well, it's not that bad. But I am still pretty pissed of at the local ABC coverage. They cut off the first half hour of coverage by playing David Brinkley at 12:30 instead of an earlier time slot. I don't even understand their problem. If they didnt think enough people would  not watch the game why would they decide to show most of the game? And if they showed the remaining 2.5 hours of the game, would it hurt to play David Brinkley at its regular time? They dont have any decent programming before noon anyway. I called the sports dept and blasted them on their machine. I called gain and someone picked it up. When I asked him why they premepted the first half hour of the Stanley Cup playoffs, he seemed a bit confused. When I explained a bit more in detail, he then said that's upto to our programming dept. call back on  Monday. weel, I understand that the sports dept is not responsible for this preemption. BUt I can't understand how someone in the sports dept. can't even recognise the name of playoffs shown on the very same station he works for.

Being a PhD-student at David Chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.  The report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be retrieved from  ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)  from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA. The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.  ==================================================================== ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the representation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier systems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in both computation and communication complexity than any such system proposed previously.    Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability. Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the Diffie-Hellman problem.     Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in previously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the first place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender after the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user, which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems. Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by a simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that previous solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system can be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while retaining its computational efficiency. ====================================================================  Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!    I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as possible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to me and I will try to reply as good as I can. Any comments are also welcome!  Stefan Brands, \",\"Does anyone know of a site where I could ftp some RenderMan shaders? Or of a newsgroup which has discussion or information about RenderMan?

Avoid things that would plug her up.  Crohn's has no dietary restriction in general.   The feeling obout this has changed in the GI community.  The current feeling is that inflammation is not induced by food.  There is even evidence that patients deprived of food have mucosal atrophy due to lack of stimulation of intestinal growth factors.  There is now interest in providing small amounts of nasogastric feeding to patients on IV nutrition.  But I digress.   Symptoms can be drastically enhanced by food, but not inflammation.   The low residue diet is appropriate for you if you still have obstructions. Again, it is not felt that food causes inflammation.  These foods are avoided because they may get stuck.  I'd go ahead and have the fudge, though ;-)  .  Spencer makes an especially good point in having an observant and informed patient.  Would that many patients be able to tell what causes them problems.  The digestive processing idea is changing, but if a food causes problems, avoid them.  Be sure that the foods are  tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.  Crohn's commonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with severly restricted diets that take months to renormalize.  There was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussed the issue of dietary restriction of fiber.  It would be worth reading to anyone with an interest in Crohn's.

First, in February, the Russians deployed a 20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from the Mir Space Station.  While this \\\"Banner\\\" reflector was blank, NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner reflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space- based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV commercial, as filmed from the Mir.    The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga booster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the \\\"Environmental Billboard\\\".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the \\\"Environmental Billboard\\\" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to 804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area, deployed by the inflatable 'frame'.    To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry \\\"ozone reading sensors\\\" to \\\"continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's delicate protective ozone layer,\\\" according to Mike Lawson, head of SMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. According to IMI, \\\"as the biodegradable material burns, it will release ozone-building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer.\\\" The remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns up and \\\"adds to the ozone supply.\\\"    This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several millions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI estimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who watched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost $600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.    But back to Brian's questions:        See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my estimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus $10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon someone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.     And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use of launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think the legal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer, and no, I don't really like the idea of this additional light pollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the space advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an idiot?)    (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a low enough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just after dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the time of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still be a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)     As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There were about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga advertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for only a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious funding for this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.       And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be my guest.

Although Gary is correct in noting that malpractice-related problems are greater in the US than Canada, they by no means account for the overall difference in health care costs.  (They do account for a somewhat larger portion of the difference in physicians' gross income in the two countries.)  Some facts.  Malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1% of total health care costs in the US.  In 1991, according to a survey of  physicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averaged paying 3.7% of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance.   Malpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985; they've declined significantly since then.  At the same time, health care costs have increased more than any period in history.  As far as \\\"defensive medicine\\\" is concerned, the AMA estimates that its total impact is about $7 billion per year.  That's about 8% of the total current INCREASE in health care costs -- and the estimate is from a group that could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicine on health care.  As small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things, however, Clinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnification of MD's against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by their specialties.  This would eliminate most, if not all frivolous suits while retaining the ability to sue for true malpractice.  jsh\",\"I'm looking for a sport-cruiser - factory installed fairings ( full/half ), hard saddle bags, 750cc and above, and all that and still has that sporty look.

Hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.  De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht, vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er staat echter meer op stapel.  Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten 'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren. Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren, waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel. Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!  Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar, in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren. Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en trachten te verklaren. Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.  Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en f 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening 44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900.

If most people }use scissors to cut paper, shouldn't Consumer's Reports }test scissors for paper-cutting ability, even though }scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth?  That's possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching Jewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this highly-interpreted version is what was \\\"enlightened for its times\\\". To (attempt to) extend the analogy, this is like saying that the original scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for their times, even though they only ever cut cloth, and had never even heard of paper.  I'm not arguing that the Bible is \\\"disgusting\\\", though some of the history depicted in it is, by modern standards.  However, history is full of similar abuses, and I don't think the Biblical accounts are worse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours.  On the other hand, I don't know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible shows *less* abuse than their contemporaries, or ours.  That complex and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic interpretations of that history is interesting, but I still don't think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history.\",\" Science is the process of modeling the real world based on commonly agreed interpretations of our observations (perceptions).   Values can also refer to meaning.  For example in computer science the value of 1 is TRUE, and 0 is FALSE.  Science is based on commonly agreed values (interpretation of observations), although science can result in a reinterpretation of these values.   The values underlaying science are not objective since they have never been fully agreed, and the change with time.  The values of Newtonian physic are certainly different to those of Quantum Mechanics.\",\" Their phone number is 1-800-377-9777.

The first is a more complex manuver than a simple horn button push, and the second ain't too bright when there is a potential hazard ahead.  Besides, the unique sound of a horn is more effective in attracting the attention of BDI cagers than is the sound of an engine, which is what they expect to hear (you are on the road!).

It is the \\\"X Window System\\\", or \\\"X11\\\", or \\\"X\\\" or any of a number of other designations accepted by the X Consortium.  In fact, doing \\\"man X\\\" on pretty much any X11 machine will tell you:       The X Consortium requests that the following names  be  used      when referring to this software:                                    X                            X Window System                              X Version 11                      X Window System, Version 11                                  X11  There is no such thing as \\\"X Windows\\\" or \\\"X Window\\\", despite the repeated misuse of the forms by the trade rags.  This probably tells you something about how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAME of the window system right, why should one trust anything else they have  to say?  With regard to dialup X11 implementations, there are several.  You can buy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies, including both  GraphOn and NCD.  (In fact, I'm composing this from an NCD running X11 over serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.)    NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is NCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such  software packages available.  X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running X11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and  is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote.   It seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard, there will be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various  sorts of hardware.

And all good points.    Well, making a career out of it is a bit strong.  I still believe that doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I would not have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent the many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done. And 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that  would help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank goodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine that helps me.    I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That you would go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second opinion, and then move on with your life. Just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in  this field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses. These are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over the country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going to a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was  helpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very unproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research, make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.  A recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of what I'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's not a put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors are only human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.  I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things that is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart, or failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That's because  those things are much more tangible and have much more concise  definitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have to decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to find your way out of it.   I have chosen the latter.

It wasn't really until the more intelligent animals came along that some revisions to this were necessary.  Intelligent animals have different needs than the others, and hence a morality suited to them must be a bit more complicated than \\\"the law of the jungle.\\\"  I don't think that self-actualization is so subjective as you might think.  And, by objectivity, I am assuming that the ideals of any such system could be carried out completely.\",\": As far as I can tell, the MD is an offshoot of technology that already exists. : It is an MO drive.  MO drives exist already for computers.  They're expensive : and a bit slow, but the disks are cheep (128 mb disks).  Dan.  I read a recent article in Personal Computer World mainly about the new digit audion formats (DCC and MD) but at the end talked about how nice it would be to use these for data storage with a brief calculation of how much data you could store. The author had been talking to someone from Sony about these formats and mentioned this to get the reply \\\"MD is a purely audio format, we wouldn't use it for data\\\", then when pressed for info about MO the Sony man basically admitted that it was no more than a slight adaptabtion on MD!  What I think the original poster was wanting was MO drives at MD audio player prices. I'd assume that the problem here is that an MD system can have higher tolerances than an MO system as the ear doesn't pick up the occasional bit error as well as an archiving program!  --\",\"  If not for the lack of extraneously capitalized words, I'd swear that McElwaine had changed his name and moved to Cal Poly.  I also find the choice of newsgroups 'interesting'.  Perhaps someone should tell this guy that 'sci.astro' doesn't stand for 'astrology'?  It's truly frightening that posts like this are originating at what are ostensibly centers of higher learning in this country.  Small wonder that the rest of the world thinks we're all nuts and that we have the problems that we do.

It is a 3.5\\\" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest drives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the  drive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures are from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of performance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC and just recently was released for the Mac world (don't ask me what the  differences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according to a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production. I have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak including PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse's PowerUser. The PLI and MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands are going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold  105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges are cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives. Cost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli drives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more reliable.  Personally, I'm excited by the new drive and look forward to  getting my hands on one. -Chris Wand  -- \",\" Unfortunately your phrasing is ambiguous.  Re-writing more carefully, we have (at least) two possibilities.  The first:  Things called \\\"Mercedes\\\" are cars That girl is called \\\"Mercedes\\\" Therefore that girl is a car  That is entirely valid as a piece of logical deduction.  It is not sound, because the first statement is false.  Similarly, I would hold that Jim's example is valid but not sound.

me point out that both GUI-based word-processors and text-based    formatters both have a language; one happens to be mouse- and    action-based, and the other symbol-based.  True, but that's beside the point. This is a fact about an abstract model of what the GUI users are doing, not about what they actually *are* doing. This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer* of the system. (NB: some users may see it, too, but only when they put aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.)  I'm not saying that the programmer's perspective is evil or stunted. After all, that's what I do, too! I am saying that UI designers must carefully distinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models, and they must ultimately serve the user of the system, not the builder of the system.       I don't recall the actual stats, but something like 1 in 5 people can be    categorized as a \\\"symbol manipulator\\\".  It would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this claim. At any rate, I don't think this is evidence that 20% of users think like programmers. Bankers, financial analysts, structural engineers --- these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol manipulation. But what they do is not programming, and programming is not required to do what they do. \",\"   [More stuff deleted]  This seems to be a pretty arogant definition of belief.  My beliefs are those things which I find to be true based on my experience of the world.  This experience includes study of things that I may not have experienced directly.  But even then, I can only understand the studies to the extent to which I can relate what I study back to what I have experienced.  Which means that by beliefs about God are directly related to my experience of God.  Having experienced God, I try to make sense of that experience.  I study religion and read the Bible.  I find things that echo what I have already experienced.  Out of this I build my beliefs.  I also find things that don't match my experience.  That doesn't make them false.  They just don't match my experience.  Maybe I will understand that stuff later.  I don't know.  Maybe all of my beliefs are wrong.  I can change my beliefs.  If someone else has beliefs that are different from mine, so what. Neither of us are necessarily wrong.  Someone else is making sense out of a different set of experiences.  Even though we have different explanations and beliefs, if we talk we might even discover that the underlying experiences are similar.  Some people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in one form, and usually has a single revelation.  The more dogmatic and inflexible the belief system, the more arrogant it will appear to an outsider.  There is another approach possible, however.  God is a mystery.  I am trying to solve the mystery, so I look at the evidence available to me.  I try to arrive at the best understanding that I can based on the evidence.  New evidence may cause me to change my understanding.  When I encounter someone with a different belief than my own, it isn't a threat, it is an opportunity to perhaps discover something new about this mystery I can never fully comprehend.

Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that goaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're Montreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it; he literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides, Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.  Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more).  Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than  five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME  ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear  the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to  play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.  Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this article, if possible.   I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who) in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in regardless.   Yep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second, IMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.  Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their zone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red  Army.    But I still hate the team.  On the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a powerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit.  Same goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is waving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.  New Jersey was overmatched, Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.  Mario is unbelievable, and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.

Certainly this was mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being likely.  If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either confused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the chain inside SGI was misleading them.   There were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 came out at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  The chassis simply couldn't be pushed any further.  I'd say 4 years was a pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and age.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the hardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our minds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost from the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in the form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over its lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.   Please, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support or sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folks to misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there will be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available, but that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what you are referring to).  Yes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters, but that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result in good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into systems that aren't what they need, I'm sure, but nobody is *forcing* you to buy at end of quarter, after all...)   They don't get all that long a lead time either; although certainly they get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions may well influence the end product, but that also is life in the industry.  We can't design systems that meet just their needs, or we won't sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we don't have some niche products, like Reality Engine).   But surely you don't expect a system you buy now for a five year period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period?  That's a rather unreasonable expectation, in my experience (with workstations/microcomputers).  Supported, and parts available, yes, but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest!   I missed your first posting, but as I say, by all means share your frustation with somebody at a level inside SGI where it might have an effect (not immediate, I'm sure, but complaints aren't going to be ignored, and *may* affect future plans, if we  hear similar things from more than one person/site).

Do you think it was your right to be there? I am not saying that conflicts started with that. It is only not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering. It is sad that we (both) still are not trying to compromise. I remember the action of the Turkish government by removing the visa requirement for greeks to come to Turkey. I thought it was a positive attempt to make the relations better.  The Greeks I mentioned who wouldn't talk to me are educated people. They have never met me but they know! I am bad person because I am from Turkey. Politics is not my business, and it is not the business of most of the Turks. When it comes to individuals  why the hatred?

I wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences between PHIGS and PEXlib (it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out pretty soon).  But here's a brief summary...  PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many devices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and take advantage of a 3D extension to X called \\\"PEX\\\".  PEXlib is a slightly \\\"lower\\\" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX extension to X.  Some advantages of using PEXlib... - Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS - Provides immediate mode capabilities - Is free of \\\"policy\\\" - PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support   features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).   PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.  Some advantages of using PHIGS... - Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones - Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output - PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier - PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you - PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.  If you're working strictly in X and don't care about things like archiving, I would go with PEXlib.  Either way, you will find that both API's have a lot in common.\",\" To incrementally update the contents of windows, I use the following trick:   1. Set the window background to None,  2. Call XClearArea(display, window, 0, 0, 0, 0, True),  3. Restore the window background to its correct value.  The call to XClearArea does not repaint the window background, but still generates exposure events for visible parts of the window.  In order to let my application know that these expose events must be handled incrementally (something is already displayed on the screen and may need to be erased), I encapsulate the 3 operations with 2 self addressed client messages, which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server.

I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture using a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one (1.5).     They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite nicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by 3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he increased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps.      Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't know what model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an LCII.     Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having a little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!  This was from memory!     Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some hardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the  animation (like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator?)?

It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim to know what God thinks/wants. Especially when it's based upon your interpretation of a book.

I think it is just there and it's up to you to look for and see it, through prayer, meditation, inspir- ation, dreams or whatever.

The psoriasis is under control but the arthritis part of the illness is not.  Ansaid (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) worked pretty well for three years but isn't helping much now.  My friend is now taking Meclomen (another NSAID) but this isn't helping control the pain at all.  In the past two months my friend has also started taking Azulfadine along with the NSAID medicines, but the effects of the combined drugs aren't supposed to be realized for several months.  As a result of the pain, my friend is having problems sleeping.  Staying in one position too long is an ordeal.  Another major contributor to pain is that tendonitis has now developed (left thumb and hand with numbness at the base of the palm; bottom of feet; shoulders and outer thighs).  The tendonitis is quite painful yet my friend's doctor has not recommended any form of treatment to relieve it.  The latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and is now recommending Prednisone.  The hope is that the Prednisone will relieve some of the pain from the tendonitis.  My friend is a 41 year old male who feels like he's 80 (his words, not mine).

If anyone is interested, I'll post a summary to this newsgroup.\",\" This probably only tells you that the DC blocking capacitor that's in series between the one-chip, single-ended audio amp and the speaker terminal is there.   Open it up and look for the power amp \\\"ICs\\\".  They'll be fairly obvious.  Replace the one connected to the dead output.    Well, one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp chips.  Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to the input of a small audio amp w/speaker.  If you find line-level input to both chips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.    If you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to an outboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good enough.  This is *before* the volume control (and usually before the tone and balance controls too).  If you take off from the center and ground legs of the volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably  before the other controls).    If the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip, you should probably forget the whole thing. \",\"    I believe that E-Machines might produce something of this nature.  \",\"[reply to dufault@lftfld.enet.dec.com (MD)]     Infantile spasms have been well understood for quite some time now.

How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing, unless the person claiming to be IT is obviously insane?  I'm not saying that David Koresh is the Second Coming of Christ.  How could somebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming?  Koresh did promise that he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio broadcast.  He didn't.  Still it seems to me that he did fool some people.  And, from my meagre knowledge of the Bible, it seems that Christians have been hard on the Jews of Christ's day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities didn't accept as the Messiah.  So I was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be early to recognize the Second Coming while, at the same time, not wanting to be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be God.  [Mark 13:21   And then if any one says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!'  or 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.  Mark 13:22   False Christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and  wonders, to lead astray, if possible, the elect.  Mark 13:23   But take heed; I have told you all things beforehand.  Mark 13:24    \\\"But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be  darkened, and the moon will not give its light,  Mark 13:25   and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in  the heavens will be shaken.  Mark 13:26   And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with  great power and glory.   My understanding of Jesus' answer is that, unlike his first coming, which was veiled, the second coming will be quite unmistakeable.  He's telling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happen before his second coming -- the actual second coming will make his power openly visible.  By the way, from Koresh's public statement it's not so clear to me that he is claiming to be Christ.\",\"Hi,  I'm interested in writing a program to generate a SIRD picture, you know the stereogram where you cross your eyes and the picture becomes 3D.

The goalie puts his/her face through a piece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face and forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic wrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, a plaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12 minutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the goalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves padding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.   John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show.

Frankly, the Saturn way of doing business and service was a *very* big plus. I hadn't bought a new car since I bought my Honda 4WD back in '85, and I was unbelieveably offended by most salespeople I met.  Saturn was indeed very different. I made three different visits to the dealer where I bought my car, and was never pressured. Saturn also had the best after-sales support, and the fixed pricing made it *very* easy for me to decide exactly what I wanted to buy. Another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the dealer. He's been fixing imports for 20 years...and bought a Saturn, based on what he's seen and heard from his customers.   Saturn also has a good extended warranty program; $675 for 6 year/60K miles,  fully refunded if you don't use it. That works out to an actual cost of $170 or so, based on the 6 year treasury rates.

If it is only used for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file encryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced standard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to easy-to-break inverters.  Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap. Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e-mail and files, let's focus on this.  One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.  Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal less threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have no secure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a \\\"goat\\\" can eavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones.  -------  Reading between the lines, I infer that the system is highly secure without access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanese security services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.  Most legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and would be delighted to have a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of depositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliable escrow. Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the week, and that system has worked pretty well.  From my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that need to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. But in return we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly skilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should be checked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn't have to be, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys pursuant to a legitimate court order. Thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries, while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order.  ------  In discussing this, let's try to avoid the nastiness, personal attacks and noise of some previous threads. This is a substantive and technical issue, and personal remarks have no place in such a discussion. \",\"First, I would like to thank all who sent me their opinions on the matter at hand.  All advice was taken to heart, if not directly used.  My friend found out about the matter quite accidently.  After reading some of my mail, I quit from the mail reader & went about my business.  I must have trashed my mail improperly, because he got on the same terminal the next day & saw my old messages.  He thought they were responses to a post he placed in alt.atheism earlier that week, so he read some of them before realizing that they were for me.  I got a message from him the next day; he apologized for reading my mail & said that he did not want to appear to be a snoop.  He said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views & didn't mind doing so, especially with a friend.  So we did.  I neither changed his mind nor did he change mine, as that was not the point.  Now he knows where I'm coming from & now I know where he's coming from.  And all that I can do is pray for him, as I've always done.

I will argue that your latter statement, \\\"I believe that no gods exist\\\" does rest upon faith - that is, if you are making a POSITIVE statement  that \\\"no gods exist\\\" (strong atheism) rather than merely saying I don't   know and therefore don't believe in them and don't NOT believe in then (weak atheism). Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying   I BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even  after reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.  But first let me say the following. We might have a language problem here - in regards to \\\"faith\\\" and \\\"existence\\\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist. To exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE being - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not exist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it's rather pointless to debate the so called \\\"existence\\\" of God - and that is not what I'm doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of being. When you say that \\\"god does not exist\\\", I also accept this statement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However, in what follows I will use the phrase \\\"the existence of God\\\" in it's 'usual sense' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it. I would like a clarification upon what you mean by \\\"the existence of God\\\".   We also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what  faith  1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY b  (1): fidelity to one's promises    (2): sincerity of intentions 2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God    (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    (2): complete trust 3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ of religious beliefs syn see BELIEF    One can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say that you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion \\\"based upon observation\\\", I will have to ask \\\"what observtions are you refering to?\\\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations can only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even be predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes  partents \\\"believe in God\\\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion about the \\\"existence\\\" or \\\"non-existence\\\" of God requires a leap - and you have made this leap when you actively say \\\"I believe that God   does/does not exist\\\". Personally, I think that both statements are misguided. Arguing over the \\\"existence\\\" of God is precisely the wrong way to find Him (and yes, I use \\\"Him\\\" because a personal God is the only  viable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \\\"She\\\" go ahead. Of course  God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to  anthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I'll be  glad to.)     And please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently  disagree - it's in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person  thinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think  I have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my  ways and I correct the situation. I'm interested in a polite and well   thought out discussion.         \",\"Hello,    I have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the  newsgroup, and I think that they can be used to explain each other.   Unfortunately I don't have direct quotes handy...  1) Atheists believe that when they die, they die forever.  2) A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death    is unfair.    I don't see what the problem is!  To Christians, Hell is, by definition,  eternal death--exactly what atheists are expecting when they die.  There's no reason Hell has to be especially awful--to most people, eternal death is bad enough.   Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view, since the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such.  Personally, I don't think that people in Hell will be thrust into flame any more than I expect to Jesus with a double-edged sword issuing from his mouth--I treat both these statements as metaphorical.\",\"I don't have nor Imagine nor Real 3d, but as old Amiga user I think you should take a look also to  Real 3d 2.0 for the Amiga.

Yeah, they depreciate faster than Harleys for the first couple of years then they bottom out. Got my '86 GL1200I w/ 2275 miles on the odometer for just under $5K in May of 1990 and would ask for $4500 now with almost 16K miles onnit....that's about 50% of what a new GL1500I would cost.  Think the '86 GL1200I originally sold for $6500 brand new, not sure.  If that's the case then it depreciated 30.77% over 7 years or a mere $2000. Big Fat Hairy Deal! Based on what I know, Harleys tend to depreciate your monies far more than the initial depreciation of the bike itself when it comes to parts and service. All this about Harleys holding their value better doesn't always wash away the knocks on them...such as being much slower. ;-)   According to Peter Egan in the just released Cycle World his FLHS is a real dog when he pillions his 120lb wife.

I was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist, so I have stated this Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about 18.  For some reason, I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the resurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean the raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:  1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was  pretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right now.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the \\\"great judgement\\\" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day). I was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the church -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my \\\"soul\\\" (which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?  2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms  that my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My physical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal so it can be tortured for all eternity?  3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical place to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth? Do you think we could find it if we dig?  Mark Schnitzius schnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.edu Univ. of Central Florida  [There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I think the most common view is that final disposition does not occur until a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the meantime, some believe that people \\\"sleep\\\" until the final resurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death to the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe that souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then. There are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.  The new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a different \\\"technology\\\" than the current one, one which is not mortal. (Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus' resurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not subject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other, but I don't think most people claim to know the details.  I don't think I'd say it's the same atoms.  I'd assume there would be some analog of a physical place, but I wouldn't expect to find it under the earth or up in the sky.  I'd suspect that it's in another dimension, outside this physical world, or whatever.  But again, we have little in the way of details.\",\"Subject says it all :)  I'm looking for the jumper settings for an SMS OMTI 8610 AT-bus ESDI  controller card.

(AP) -- A police officer afraid he would be fired for allegedly assaulting a teen-ager walked into an auto body shop wher the youth worked, said \\\"You're going to die\\\" and fatally shot him and two others, police said.  A fourth youth was wounded.  A fifth escaped injury by hiding under a car.  The wounded youth ran about two blocks to a house after the shooting at about midnight Tuesday and called police.

The numbers comparing hundreds of thousands (indeed, even a million) of instances of law abiding citizens deterring criminal activity, seem valid to me.  Likewise the number of gun-caused homicides each year (about 11,000/year?).  However, it is surprising that the \\\"Evil AntiGun Empire \\\" (Darth Vader breathing sound effect here) never tries to compare \\\"All legitimate gun defenses\\\" vs. \\\"All gun crimes.\\\"  Instead,  it's always \\\"All legitimate gun defenses,\\\"  which includes cases in which the criminals are shot but not killed, and cases in which the criminal is not here, vs. just  criminal gun homicides, which only includes case sin which the victim died.  Why is this?  Of course, it wouldn't be unreasonable to say that in each crime already measured (involving guns), the consequnces are already known and it is safe to assume that a gun-based bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn into a gun-basd robbery+homicide.  Whereas in the legitimate gun defenses, one may assume that all those criminals who were deterred would have committed more crime or more serious crimes had they not been deterred.  -Case Kim\",\"Last week I posted the ALL-TIME GREATEST PLAYERS (and haphazardly misspelled several names--SORRY!)

That's not my point.  I'm >philosophically< opposed to it because of its complexity.  This complexity has led to some programs' poor TIFF writers making some very bizarre files, other programs' inability to load TIFF images (though they'll save them, of course), and a general inability to interchange images between different environments despite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.  As the saying goes, \\\"It's not me I'm worried about- it's all the abuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and unnecessary) complexity of the format.

Why do atheists spend so much time paying attention to the bible, anyway?  Face it, there are better things to do with your life!  I used to chuckle and snort over the silliness in that book and the absurdity of people believing in it as truth, etc.  Why do we spend so little time on the Mayan religion, or the Native Americans?  Heck, the Native Americans have signifigantly more interesting myths.  Also, what about the Egyptians.  I think we pay so much attention to Christianity because we accept it as a _religion_ and not a mythology, which I find more accurate.   I try to be tolerant.  It gets very hard when someone places a book under my nose and tells me it's special.  It's not.\",\" What's with you stupid dorks from the \\\"Western Business School\\\"???!!!  First there was that Cary asshole, and now you.  Don't you have anything better to do instead of being obnoxious, antagonistic little shits over the network???  Why don't you just take a hike, and stop embarrasing yourself, your school, and Canada!\",\" I understand, believe it or not, and there are any number of kinds of  conversation and communication I engage in that I wouldn't even consider  using this scheme for.  On the other hand, I don't see \\\"Clipper\\\" as providing  a secure channel--it just prevents casual eavesdropping.  This is part of why  I am not worried about it per se.  Trying to look at Clipper as a serious  security tool is simply ludicrous.  It's a voice scrambler, nothing more.  There is still plenty of market for real crypto.   They cost an arm and a leg, though. \\\"Clipper\\\" is obviously aimed at the mass  market.  It certainly won't put Cylink out of business.   This is old news.  I can do this now.   There ARE restrictions.  Example: We're a networking software vendor with a  large overseas share of our market.  We cannot currently ship PEM, or even  simple DES, in our products without case-by-case approval from the Department  of State.  ITAR presents a material trade barrier to US firms trying to  compete in international information systems markets.  Sure, you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over BBS's in  the USA.  I, on the other hand, want strong crypto (PKCS, for example) to be  the *default* for electronic mail, worldwide.  I want priests to be able to  hear confession over email.  I want lawyers to be able to talk to clients in  confidence over email, or doctors talk with patients.  I want to be able to  order products from my favorite Japanese mail-order catalog over the net.  I  want to be able to sign contracts, transact business, and so on  electronically.  This is so far infeasible as a result of the current restrictions on  crytographic systems, especially beyond the borders of the USA.  Clipper is irrelevant, and if it distracts the authorities into feeling safe,  all the better.  Its only danger is if it emboldens them into trying to put  more restrictions into place, on the theory that it is \\\"good enough for  anyone who has nothing to hide.\\\"  That argument is, of course, utter BS, just  as much as \\\"no one needs an assault rifle\\\". \",\"Henry,  didn't the Little Joe  and Big Joe  get built in under a year? 6 months for little Joe,  and 12 Months for Big Joe?  i thought i saw something on that for  a old mercury film.\",\"I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc. It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you very much).   well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell me the order of the wires.   there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.   if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.   btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of little boxes). Oh, well . . .   one more thing: in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on the newer models are different from the connection used on the plus--- you're right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plus and connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. in other words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible. it's merely a matter of finding out the correct order.   omt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solution so others can, too. thanx for the input.\",\"Hello everybody !  If you are using PIXAR'S RenderMan 3D scene description language for creating 3D worlds, please, help me.   I'm using RenderMan library on my NeXT but there is no documentation about NeXTSTEP version of RenderMan available. I can create very complicated scenes and render them using surface shaders,  but I can not bring them to life by applying shadows and reflections.  As far as I understand I have to define environmental and shadows maps to produce reflections and shadows, but I do not know how to use them.  Any advises or simple RIB or C examples will be appreciated. Thanks in advance... \",\"  Kerry-- I'm guessing a little at this, because it's been a few years  since I saw the info, but you will probably want to look at Air Defense  Artillery as a specialty, or possibly Signals.  The kind of thing you're  looking for is SDI-type assignments, but it'll be pretty prosaic stuff. Things like hard-kill ATBM missiles, some of the COBRA rigs -- that kind  of thing.    Hope that gives you some ideas on where to look, though. \",\" ------------ Part 6 of 14 ------------ MAZ)75U=7R!1KP\\\"5A8=F>`7;UG)\\\\&V0&>*YZ>*W5&$'Z]M;T0AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX=7HLAL(;7(5U\\\\,MEIH@$H^,#\\\",4*&?8%'U#6#,-V`W!H>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'A[0E9:0E97PM8]8M9#MH M6CNL]%&'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AUL4SU=7Z/*V&U<2X!!:6M3BYK7L:.Q-TZ#Q M[/%#\\\\>SL[.R'AX>'A\\\\!$%$-:U`Q7S]1_S\\\\BB%!2B5Q2'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'A\\\\\\\"@ M`B'Q(DCQ[$H=L;FGO;5:X(>'AX>J\\\"<]75\\\\B`P;Z@,-\\\"X@^&?S%$<JPV?-P;K MH9\\\\WS!=@-XQ<AX>'AS'$9@L+I4=Z>BJ[P#9U)5L4`LA75P);V6$KGJEXE5-3 M[>V+BXN+BXN+BXN+BXLT-,7%-#0T-#0T-#0T-#0TBXN+[>WM4[\\\"PSU?/@$H, M5\\\\]-(8AH:(#!0]QH:&S30QVQ:$,0L;&([/%'1T='W]_?W]_?W]^I=3:F:JQ2 M`2NTOJYN#N`0:.SP99LI])0GGV!1%X&,]\\\"0M<(>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AS'$9F8+I:5'1Z6E M\\\"V;$,3$QQ,3$9F8+\\\"PNEI0L+9L0Q,3$Q,3$Q,3'$Q&9F9@L+\\\"PL+\\\"PMF\\\"PL+ M\\\"PL+9L3$Q#$QAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX=4 M5%22DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2 MDI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*25%145%145%145%145%14%A86%A86%LG)R<G)R<G) MR<G)R<G)R<G)R<G)R<G)R<G)R<F)B8F)B8F)B8F)B8F)B8G)R<G)R<G)B8F) MB8F)B8F)B8F)3$Q,3$P/9\\\\4T-(OM[>U3L!D9<3T]F0,#7KN[*BHJ*GIZ>M_?

It is the home of the muslim a s well as jewish religion, among others.  Heck, nobody ever mentions what Yitza k Shamir did forty or fifty years ago which is terrorize westerners much in the  way Abdul Nidal does today.  Seems Isrealis are nowhere above Arabs, so theref ore they have a right to Jerusaleum as much as Isreal does. \",\"  As I remember it, the name of the program your looking for is called icofrite.   Cica was where I saw it last. It was quite a while ago. \",\" This a \\\"tried and true\\\" method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups: to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace, thus forcing the opposing \\\"state\\\" to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or, in order to avoid the deaths of civilians, abandon the search. Certainly the people who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm's way.  Are you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, Israel should totally back down? So...the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives?   Your damn right Israel insists on some sort of \\\"demilitarized\\\" or \\\"buffer\\\" zone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory of Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactly surprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to  do it themselves.   What? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states  can start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the  responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their  soil. They have to Prove it (or provide some \\\"guaratees\\\"), there is no way Israel is going to accept their \\\"word\\\"- not with their past attitude of  tolerance towards \\\"anti-Israel guerillas in-residence\\\".  Good lord, Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop anything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows them in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in '56 and '67. Somehow, with that \\\"limitation\\\" on the troops \\\"powers\\\" I don't think that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) \\\"guarantees\\\" by other parties, the UN is worthless to Israel (but, perhaps useful as a \\\"ruse\\\"?).   Perhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is the feeling that it is better that \\\"many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently  accept our fate.\\\" If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of  suffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian, Arab and Islamic groups.   From Israel's perspective, \\\"concessions\\\" gets it NOTHING...except the  realization that it has given \\\"something\\\" up and now *can only  hope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken back* by merely doing so; to \\\"take back\\\" tangible items (land, control of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should stay away from.   Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades  before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon. The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel  would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state  involved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure  in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts  committed by \\\"private groups\\\", 3) Israel would prepare for the next  round of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and don't be so idiotic as to suggest \\\"trust\\\" for the motivations of present-day Arab states)?  Ah, ok...what is \\\"different\\\" about the present situation that tells us that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic  policies towards Israel? Now, don't talk about vague \\\"political factors\\\" but about those \\\"tangible\\\" (just like that which Israel gave up) factors that \\\"guarantee\\\" the responsibility of those states. Your assessment of \\\"difference\\\" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions, and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing.   It has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria, Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred. Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain  control? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel.

However, I agree that it's quite the sneaky trick.  No more than I would expect, however. -- \",\"Where's an ftp site for Trumpet?  (other than wuarchive, umich,.. something off the beaten path??)\",\"Hi, I have been getting a lot of requests for this information so I thought I would post it for those interested parties. (Sorry for length).  To increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed from 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively. This is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some aluminum foil down to work on.  1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case.  2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables,   spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out.  3. Remove the flopy drive.  4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting   the supply straight up and out.  5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom   side of the fan and lifting straight up and out.  6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and   right side of the board and sliding the board forward then   lifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the   board must be removed first)  7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules).   This is not easy even for a skilled solderer.  8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins   by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.  9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder    them in.  10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.  11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and    the other large chip just to the right of the processor and   figure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made a   simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole   in the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using   insulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat   sync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.   12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.  Disclaimer: this is only the procedure I used and is not authorized by anyone.      You are on your own for this procedure. I'm quite sure it will      void your warentee.\",\"I have an Adcom GFA-555 that I got in 1985.  There certainly isn't anything magic about it.  The components used are decent, but nothing uncommon with respect to consumer grade components.  The GFA-555 is a nice piece of equipment.  I'm glad that Adcom had the guts to not over-do the packaging.  It irks me when I see audiophile oriented equipment whose case and heat sinks probably cost much more and receive more attention than the electronics they are supposed to serve.  I don't see any big deal about the geographic region in which something is assembled.  This is especially true for something as low-technology as a GFA-555.  I'd hope that a GFA-545 would still work well after several years. Except under conditions of extreme abuse, there isn't much there to go wrong.  \",\"--------------------------- The federal government has used such laws to allow mutliple charges in order to prevent more crimes than would nromally occur just from two people being pissed off at each other.

It's the way they broke the back of the Klan, by putting a lot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically. It is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid since over 100 years ago. It has been used whenever a select group was getting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being part of a minority. It is the only way we made the defeat of the south stick after the Civil War. People who harrassed free blacks, when normally they wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were expeditiously tried and jailed for 5 to 8 years until nobody wanted to try it anymore. Now with the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law, the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent as much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to somebody. They can call out the national guard just for them, as they did the school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 1950's, and the president can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of the militia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at the thousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obey or face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms! And by god, they did! Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets! And the governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshalls that had brought the order to nationalize the guard. And that's why we need such an ability in federal jurisdiction. -RSW \",\" Flame on!!  Is this guy serious????

From all I've heard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg- ressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car at the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that he grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in Germany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic). What you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due to fear':  When driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the majority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody fails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can go (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :). So any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex- posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to handle it - or you lose...  That's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation -  whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to the volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more people (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened) and each accident is one accident too much.   Better designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto- bahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word -  a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high); those guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals can crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is that esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very timid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.   You're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) - but the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that in Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abiding the local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'm used to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I consider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...   Sorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a Peugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' over here - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.   I disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars weigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at 130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph, it makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on a bicycle: Your're dead.  Bye, Stefan --- Stefan Dalibor (dalibor@immd3.uni-erlangen.de)\",\"Here is a different viewpoint.   In practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed  with inkjet because smudges etc. can happen.   A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of  that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? Inkjets are faster than  you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the  printer. (I have a 486/33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the  printer)  A sage said to me: \\\"Do you want one copy or lots of copies?\\\", \\\"One\\\",  \\\"Inkjet\\\".    Paper cost is the same and both can use refills. Long term the laserprinter  will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that  are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.  HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the  software package has no inkjet driver.   There is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a  page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a  laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers  actually use this facility.

Where do they come  #from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from #whatever is societally mandated.  It's only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily very crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what is necessary to keep that society going  - and often it's a little over-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different thing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble), but is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating meat may be perfectly legal.  # #>#Merely a question for the basis of morality #># #>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_. #># #>#1)Who is society # #>Depends on the society. # #Doesn't help.

If society is who should make the rules, that's yet another.

The hard trick is to recognise when it is, and equally importantly, when it isn't.  # and only interfering when it's truly #>necessary. # #Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?  IMO, it isn't often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various kinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive  the right to interfere is a difficult question - it's a sort of liar's paradox: \\\"force is necessary for freedom\\\".   One possible justification is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if their own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise if we don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom. # #  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem #>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem #>to agree that some level of interference is necessary. # #They see the need for a \\\"justice\\\" system.

Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something  I say can't be all bad.  ;-)  Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.   I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science  is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your  contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \\\"scientific\\\"  can possibly know what's true and what's not.     Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees  of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \\\"If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us.\\\"    To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \\\"There've got to be controlled studies\\\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home.  Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast  Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying \\\"We don't have any way of  knowing that it's effective.\\\"    These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  \\\"Why should I prove your  theory?\\\"  and  \\\"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\\\"   One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't  been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of  books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as I'm capable of.)    Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \\\"doctrinnaire\\\"  attitudes about science.    Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.   If so, I apologize.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\": I'm in the market for all small (12x12 or so) digitizing tablet and would : like any comments.

Again from my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}: Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some   specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller   specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.    Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the   end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a  SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2  which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it   needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be   very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst   {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and  reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between  SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.  IBM HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: [...] IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives.

In full SCSI-2 mode it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can. The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}\",\"  [stuff deleted]   Really?

Especially when the university is locatd in a nice residential area.  A friend of mine was attacked and nearly raped in just this situation.  The police didn't feel she was in a situation which 'encouraged criminals'.  What do you think?  Should we just tell her, that it was her fault for daring to ride a bicycle in the middle of the day?  That she didn't avoid a situation that encouraged criminals?  If that's the case, then we'd all better put bars on our doors and windows and pray for a police state to keep us all safe.  Crime happens in all situations - there are no defined areas that criminals avoid.  \",\" Fishing rights are disputed.

Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news     frequently.       WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?      The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks     (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).      The \\\"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\\\" ASC G&C 2102,   \\\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is  commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower  clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)  orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a  negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other  advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort  maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of  the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining  downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target  in second stage.\\\"      This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try     to interpret.      1) We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.      2) Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack  between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the  \\\"relative wind\\\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line  between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly  negative angle (\\\"a negative q-alpha\\\"). This causes a little bit of  \\\"downward\\\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z  direction) and this force \\\"alleviates structural loading.\\\"  We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the  most \\\"delicate\\\" part of the vehicle.      3) The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more  mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or  to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be  the case if we didn't roll (\\\"performance gain\\\").      4) The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated  flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort  maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\\\"decreased abort maneuver  complexity\\\").      5) The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio  antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio  antennae on the Orbiter (\\\"improved S-band look angles\\\").      6) The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a  helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.      7) The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is  more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east  (usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity  in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:  velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.  The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its  velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.      This all begs the question, \\\"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude?\\\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one     for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main     Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is     fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \\\"top\\\"     [Orbiter side] and the \\\"bottom\\\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the     Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle     guy.)      I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics. He added that the \\\"roll     maneuver\\\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.     The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total     maneuver is really expressed as a \\\"quaternion,\\\" a grad-level-math     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element     array.       HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT      NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite     dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72     degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed     over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from     California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.     shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite     for these viewers.      If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.     It's worth asking if yours doesn't.      The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is     frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press     conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle     missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying     much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions     are not being covered.

Even as a libertarian, I have to admit government does do some things I like.  There is a beautiful performing arts complex in Ft.  Lauderdale that was partially built with tax dollars (I don't know how much was private and how much was stolen, I mean public) but it is beautiful and I enjoy it.  (Keep in mind, though, most of the people in the city will never attend a single performance there, so they might feel differently about having to help pay for it.)  However, I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to give government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis.  In fact, we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely because it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as other issues.  Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  They do not try to decide just whether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speech should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  You can imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority on a case-by-case basis.  Not so with economic issues.  Government does tell taxi-drivers exactly what they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers.  Just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a case-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a case-by-case basis.  There is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with free enterprise.  But there is no hope, in my opinion, of having a government that interferes with free enterprise in an \\\"efficient\\\" manner; I call it political market failure.  Thus, if you value freedom and the abundance it produces, you have to swallow the \\\"whole libertarian agenda.\\\"\",\"As quoted from <1993Apr5.172734.8744@icd.ab.com> by kdw@icd.ab.com (Kenneth D.

Neto):  This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to do with this.  Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.  That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays, or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination.  Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.  The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h, MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek, this is 12.  As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case.  We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of course, I could say \\\"Buy all you want, we'll support more.\\\" -- \",\"   Where can I get xman source?

Cleveland Indians - Still don't seem to know what they are doing 6.  Detroit Tigers - All key players but Fryman are another year past peak 7.  Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than 7th  Al West - this division was the toughest for me to pick.  Whoever of the top           4 gets pitching should win it. 1.  Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success 2.  Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here.  Jose Canseco? 3.  Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching. 4.  Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close 5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here 6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs 7.  California Angels - will win no games  NL East 1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach! 2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga 3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected 4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a \\\"team\\\" 5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me 6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing 7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doing  NL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division. 1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern 2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all 3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend.

The assignment is to come up with a product and create a marketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at this point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a \\\"full page\\\" monitor for laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed by authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook screen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember, technical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR \\\"full\\\" height.  The screen would probably be monochrome. The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and applications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We could hopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.  Now, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really need some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me via email and let me know: 1. If you would consider buying a \\\"full page\\\" laptop screen 2. How much you would be willing to pay for it 3. Any helpful commentaries on the idea  Also, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful, but who knows!), please send me some.  Thanks in advance!!!\",\"..deleted...

TIA,   John\",\"THE EMPTY TOMB:  CAN WE TRUST IT?                     by the late Wilbur M. Smith, D.D.                               (1894-1977)            When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about      Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:                   Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son                of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief                priests and unto the scribes, and they shall                condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him                to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and                to crucify Him; and the third day He shall                rise again\\\" (Matthew 20:18-19).            Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,      who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving      reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He      knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious      leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that      one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual      death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly      how He would die--*by crucifixion.*            All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the      minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted      would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise      again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.            But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-      tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-      tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.            The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth      between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and      ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which      had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against      the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had      predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and      on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the      disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some      of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the      tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,      they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back      to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus' friends, Peter and      John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the      tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came      hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them      to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).            How did this tomb become empty?            One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--      professor of New Testament literature in a large theological      seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*      the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by      bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb      became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the      chimney at Christmas time.            But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down      any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa      Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the      tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.            Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-      bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by      mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.            Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,      tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar      in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)      that the women went to the wrong tomb.            The facts are these:            First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to      which by mistake they could have gone.            Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or      more people to forget the place where they have buried their      dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women      did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to      the wrong tomb?            Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?            There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the      evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.                    Now when they were going, behold, some                of the watch came into the city and showed                unto the chief priests all the things that                were done.  And when they were assembled                with the leaders and had taken counsel, they                gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,                Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole                Him away while we slept.  And if this come to                the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and                secure you.  So they took the money, and did                as they were taught:  and this saying is com-                monly reported among the Jews until this day                (Matthew 28:11-15).            This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the      fact that the tomb was empty.            You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never      questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to      see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.            Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that      the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples      came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*            How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?      Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.            Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject      the explanation, the very character and the later history of the      disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away      the body of Jesus.            First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in      Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to      contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His      resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there      had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,      then proved.            Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would      have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.      It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most      of these men did.            The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ      had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it      would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed      pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing      humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today      as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.            But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to      leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to      what had happened to Him.            Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.            He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning      (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-      18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He      walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that      night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper      room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).            A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at      the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren      on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the      apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-      8).            As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-      ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed      attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are      unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the      unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the      appearances.            Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our      leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are      antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest      thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.      Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;      Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of      Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president      of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.            But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has      it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:      it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.            Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He      claimed to have come down *from* God.            He said He was the way *to* God.            He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.            He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one      else had it.            He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to      us.            Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed      that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*            Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe      that His words are all true?            The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us      that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?            And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead      testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some      day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.            In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all      this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For      He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-      ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a      hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.\",\"Hello all:  I was wondering, is the \\\"Kermit\\\" package (the actual package, not a different program with Kermit file transfers) available for Microsoft Windows 3.0/3.1?

From LA Times, Friday, April 9, 1993.  P. A1.    EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE    By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer    SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the  Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a  nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than  950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as  12,000 people.    Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco  authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how  operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and  infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,  right-wing and what they called \\\"pinko\\\" organizations.    Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known  organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting  anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking  any laws.    Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to  gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los  Angeles and San Francisco.    Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political  spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan  Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish  Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of  directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San  Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.    People who were subjects of the spy operation included former  Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.  LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who  is based in South Africa.    Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was  confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement  agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and  organizations was sold separately to the South African government.    In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from  police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony  counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West  Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify  the search warrant.    The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than  25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.  Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in  San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation  Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax  attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not  be reached for comment, his office said.    Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a  panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial  recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a  former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.    The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied  repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.  League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an  employee and have said they simply traded information with police  departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.    But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches,  San Francisco police alleged that \\\"ADL employees were apparently less  than truthful\\\" in providing information during an earlier search  conducted without a warrant.    David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said  the organization has not violated the law.  \\\"There is nothing  nefarious about how we operate or what we have done,\\\" he said.  \\\"Our  record speaks for itself.\\\"    The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret  fund used to pay for \\\"fact-finding operations.\\\"  Lehrer, according to  the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.  Patterson.    An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to  a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending  them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.    Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for  nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with  San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many  sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as  \\\"Skins\\\" and \\\"Pinkos,\\\" but that did not necessarily mean that they were  under surveillance.    \\\"I might never see or call up on 99% of them again,\\\" Bullock said.  \\\"And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a  threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under,  say, 'Pinko.'\\\"    In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police  Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he  was questioned by the FBI in the case.    A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records  and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,  vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license  photographs.    Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and  Bullock also provided information to the South African government,  receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.    The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the  South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss  nature of the spy operation.    The file notes that Kraft's articles \\\"appear frequently in The Times  and are well researched and written,\\\" but little else about the file  is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another  Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong  Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal  information.    Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how  Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from  skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash  of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his  own paid informants under code names such as \\\"Scott\\\" and \\\"Scumbag.\\\"    He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,  exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,  including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.    It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying  on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African  government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an  agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the  probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The  Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather  information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,  Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and  investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league  offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of  San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax  Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to  cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los  Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that  some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may  have come from Los Angeles police officers.        From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.    ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION    By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.    SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a  civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities  who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential  police information on citizens and groups.    But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation  League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many  felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax  violations and conspiracy.    Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful  about its spying operations, which collected information on more than  12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political  spectrum.    Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show  that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept  files on political figures.    Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down  its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when  deciding what charges to file.    In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.  Foxman described the ADL as \\\"a Jewish defense agency which has fought  to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80  years.\\\"    Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on  extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing  information to police, journalists, academics, government officials  and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain  information illegally, he said.    \\\"Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and  physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or  identity of any source of information,\\\" Foxman said.    The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its  longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than \\\"a private  individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'\\\"    Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements  showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through  Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.    \\\"Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be  distanced from ADL,\\\" Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.  Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.    Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate  with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn  over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's  offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.    A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,  produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial  transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it  will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.    \\\"The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,\\\"  the district attorney said.\",\" Unfortunately, elections can, and are, bought.  Promise the voters money, and they will vote for you.   Same here.  Convicted felons may not legally purchase firearms.   That you know of.  While I lived in the DBR, a gang robbed a joint US Army/Bundewehr armoury and got several hundred M-16s, ammunition, handguns and some explosives.  When I left two years later, there were no clues.   Who uses them is the problem.  Crime, in the U.S., is \\\"no big deal\\\" if you are the criminal.  How about 5 years for murder.  Credit for time served (in jail, waiting for trial) and you are out in 12 months, worst case.  If we would put criminals, especially violent ones, in the slam for true sentences, crime would drop.  Instead, we reward them for being good and let them out early, very early.   Serbs, Croats and Muslims have been killing each other almost since before the invention of guns.  Old women are throwing stones at UN trucks.  This is a hatred that goes beyond reason.  Yes, the problem is the user.

Regarding the verses relevant to nature, I prefer to use Dr. Maurice Bucaille's translations (in his book, \\\"The Bible, the Qur'an and Science\\\") for in general his translations are more literal.   Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as   \\\"...Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion.\\\"  (Also note that \\\"the celestial bodies\\\" in the first translation quoted by you above is the translator's interpolation -- it is not existent in the original Arabic, which is why it is included in brackets.)

Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same type from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and had closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.  Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?  If you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.   As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more  than you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in  the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is  at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second marker?    Anyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the  light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have a problem detecting the end of the tape.  If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor is out.

(Design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the MOSIS scalable design rules.) Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors:  1) They don't help much with simultaneous output switching--there is  still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the  load capacitor (on both the signal line and the ground  return), so you still get ground and power line bounce.   2) They do help a lot with on-chip loads, as I had with the high load  on the clock lines.   3) The transients you are trying to suppress are really high  frequency, so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff  capacitors, since the RC time constant is too large.  What I did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich,  but put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent  diff-metal1 contacts.  I forget exactly how wide the poly  lines were.  If I were doing this design again, I'd probably  omit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,  using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high  resistance it can be ignored at these speeds).  4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with  slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for  output signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.  I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for  a MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as I  needed.

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for  many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size  and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard  x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,  bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)  may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different  line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of  distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in  the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek  alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts  can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device  drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile  format and renderer.   The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.  The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly  granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without  consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT  object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it  is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely  available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed  somewhere in the documentation for the package.   We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of  user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any  published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,  which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that  as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the  kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest  in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only  afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on  those which help us get our work done.   PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically  without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub  routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any  modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the  header file \\\"plplot.h\\\"; see the documentation for more details.   The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of  several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex  plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to  the code, so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained  there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes.     At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:    Unix: SunOS    A/IX     HP-UX    Unicos    DG/UX    Ultrix    SysV    Linux    Amiga/Exec   MS-DOS   OS/2   NeXT   For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:   - appendices to the PLPLOT manual   - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to education, to establish a family and have children, to human dignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are more important to human existence that the rights of states.  2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and rights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.  3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as Jewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an unresolved conflict exists.  4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of people. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples and nations.  5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.  6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional political means have failed.  7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two distinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the land, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.  8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake of peace and justice. When people love, they share.  Having stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.  1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew and the other Palestinian-Arab.  2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner, although born in areas under current Isreali control, is not entitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.  3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For the second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each subsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.   4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and Christian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of governments and international organizations.  5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on 'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the Middle-East in a graceful manner.  Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will attempt to identify some of these:  1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected forms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However, it is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at reducing racial discrimination and segregation.  2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed struggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the 'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but Israeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be defeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental human rights over collective rights (see above)  3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of financial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their point of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People overrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of human rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar Bronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he gave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing assimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its effects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see above)  4.      It may objected that only a few people in Israel/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus not serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist attitudes.  5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to bring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has merits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than $3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government and by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the Middle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a non-segregated society in that worn-torn land.  I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful discussion and enrichment.\",\"Sorry for taking this off of Sharon's resp, but I'd also like to add some more verses to that and perhaps answer the second Q.  Verses:    1 Corinthians 6:9-10    Colossians 3:5-10  As for knowing when, that's a bit tricky.  People normally have consciences which warn them about it.  However, as in my case, a conscience can be hardened by sin's deceitfulness (Hebrews 3:12:13) so that the person has no idea (or doesn't care about it) that they are sinning.  Of course, there are those sins which we do when we don't know that they're sinful to begin with.  Those take searching and examining of Scripture to find out that they are sinful and then repent and change.  The best question to ask in every circumstance to judge sinful possibilities is:  \\\"Would Jesus wholeheartedly do this at this point in time?\\\"  I know, it sounds like a cop-out, but it truly is a stifling question.  Joe Fisher\",\" Basically, there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside, outside or on the polygon. The first one is Ray (or half line) method. In this method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd, then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache.  The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then it is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.  My experience tells the second method is relible.  Hope this helps.\",\"  Some countries have laws about importing crypto gear--I believe the U.S. does.

The \\\"whole Russian strategy\\\" is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano, who was GM before Murray.  What the previous GM also did was to trade  away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, most notably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years with Philly after leaving here.  Also, it's not the volume of trades that will  necessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a  great player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly to the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by  injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered).

Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research specifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not as tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am not competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns out that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \\\"Greek Lexicon\\\" renders each verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical order.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is far from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes things a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is indeed \\\"chorion.\\\"   Now I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:   \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Louw and Nida  \\\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\\\"  \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Grimm  \\\"Word study Concordance,\\\" Tynsdale  \\\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other    early Christian Writings,\\\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich  \\\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\\\" Perschbacher  In each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:   A space, place, region, district, field, area, \\\"country place,\\\"   land, farm, estate, \\\"a bit of tillage\\\", and similar meanings.  Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about \\\"grave.\\\" As some of these  books go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books  are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I  think it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into \\\"contradictions\\\" to  be once again, as your friend said it, \\\"lacking in substance,\\\" and thus Archer  is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would  have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them to support Mr Archer's contentions).   By the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of \\\"agros,\\\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word \\\"agros\\\" is defined as \\\"a field in the country.\\\" Chorion is specifically noted as a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly Bullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for \\\"field\\\" in Matthew (ie: agros) is different from the word for \\\"field\\\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and thus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already admit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity which drives the point home).   So as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise (eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this  particular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer questions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and  the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in discussing the \\\"Potter's Field.\\\"       Later,      Dave Butler\",\"INteresting question about Galileo.

The Russians usually treated the people   well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these  places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.  They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the  Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality  problem.

I don't believe that physical knowledge has a great deal of impact on the power of God.  In the past, God gave us the ability to create life through sexual relations.  Now, he is giving us the ability to create life through in vitro fertilization.  The difference between the two is merely  cosmetic, and even if we gain the ability to create universes we won't begin to approach the glory of God.   The power we are being given is a test, and I am sure that in many cases we will use our new abilities unwisely.  But, people have been using sexuality unwisely for millenia and I haven't heard an outcry to abolish it yet!   No matter how far we extend our dominion over the physical world, we aren't impinging on God's power.

But not all of them did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.

This is not the same thing as saying that the syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include: psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most -- maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental toxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of these.

Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically superior as well!).  On a related topic, who is to say that \\\"color\\\" is more or less correct than \\\"colour\\\" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed to American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API terms such as \\\"XAllocColor\\\" and \\\"colormap\\\".  In a world that uses the term \\\"Windows\\\" to refer to Microsoft Windows, perhaps the time has come to accept \\\"X Windows\\\" as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say, \\\"the X Window System\\\" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it. Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short, snappy, descriptive title (\\\"X\\\" is positively obscure) will help when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a software engineer!).

The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.

In the case of Bosnia, the risks are obviously much greater, and there are other countries in a much better position and with far better reasons to take action than the US.   You continue to misunderstand.  I did not say the reason why people want to intervene is because of racist (<- you seem to be overly fond of using this word, btw.  I said the phenomenon was race-related, which is not the same as racist.  Perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp) motives - I said the attention and outrage at the entire Yugoslavian situation was a result of it being 1) closer to home, 2) happening to people we can identify with, and 3) relentlessly harped on by the media.  I never said anything about which side would be preferred, which has a lot more to do with the presentation of the conflict than any psychological factors.  I think there is no doubt that despite the fact we intervened in Somalia, the level of attention devoted to there was considerably less than what is devoted to Bosnia, if the newspapers and tv news I see are any guide. \",\"Here is a press release from the White House.   President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President  Clinton in a question and answer session with the press:  1:36 P.M. EDT       THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk. Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day standoff ensued.       The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably insane.       He engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover, responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in February.  Given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound.       This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully. The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender.       I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I discussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I thought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision.       Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy. Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued.       Now we must review the past with an eye towards the future.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been dne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the American people.       I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances.       Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now.       Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, after 51 days, you decided --       Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with --       THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go first and then the other.       Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --       Q  Mr. President --       THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I can't do it at once.       Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?       THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.       I was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials. There were no shots coming back from the government side.       I asked a number of questions.  The first question I asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons I was given were the following:       Number one, that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be needed in other parts of the country.       Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult members to come out.       Number three, that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with the passage of time.       And number four, that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions.       So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time. The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time.       The third question I asked was, has the military been consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance.       Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that today.       Q  Mr. President --       THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.       Q  Can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?       THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold.       There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday. I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry King Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control.       I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves.  (Applause.)       I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate themselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the children.       But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno, is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she said, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for that.  So that is where I think things stand.       Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of patience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really decide that way?       THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume is just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we should have known?  Is there some other question they should have asked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have.       There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it again.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do, particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves.       Q  Mr. President, were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from February 28th until yesterday?       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all along the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go back -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good job of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them early on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of the other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the authorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward.       Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves. That's what they thought.       Q  Did the government know that the children did not have gas masks?       Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that?       THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do whatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully cooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the country.\",\" :In article <Apr18.194927.17048@yuma.ACNS.ColoState.EDU>  :>Note that measures to protect yourself from :>TEMPEST surveillance are still classified, as far as I know.  :I think this to be inaccurate.

In order for them to work properly, I would have to find out what DMA channel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers.  I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA. I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either.  I do know that on EISA/MCA systems, you can allow BM cards to use the same DMA channel.\",\"Forty-two is six times nine. \",\"  Not a typo.

One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader. \\\"What could be better,\\\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging?      \\\"It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,\\\" announced Ryne Sandberg.  \\\"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to win.      \\\"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\\\"      The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.      Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center.  \\\"Cool Papa\\\" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone grounded out to second, ending the threat.        \\\"Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\\\"  So came the analysis from Frank Chance.      The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs, Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense. He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.      Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph.      Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st      Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday. The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of first in this wacky season.      Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2 Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday. The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3-2.  \\\"We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed,\\\" remarked Lou Brock.  \\\"I don't see why we can't win this division.\\\"      The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first. -------------------------------------------------------------------      New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs, now 2 back - but in 4th!     \\\"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a pitcher's park like this,\\\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith Hernandez added that \\\"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year, and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\\\"  The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.      Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the .500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins, and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go. ------------------------------------------------------------------      San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5):      Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw, \\\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\\\"      Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13. Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the National League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace. They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.      In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score. The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely. -------------------------------------------------------------------      San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the trade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.      Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after 10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home, and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):      Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \\\"Normally,\\\" Drysdale remarked, \\\"I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't Davis will get decked once.\\\"      The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away, with center field at 420 feet.  \\\"It's as if some three-year-old threw a tantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit home runs',\\\" remarked Roy Campanella.      The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway, Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings, according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the Astros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent. Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.      \\\"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\\\" he explained.      \\\"How can we do that,\\\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.      \\\"They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time.\\\"      The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.      \\\"We're mostly a power team,\\\" remarked Ron Cey.  \\\"Jackie and, when he plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other plays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I guess that's why they're so successful there.\\\"  Indeed, it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.

Many veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that in an endemic area, they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs presenting with lameness, swollen joints, +/- fever.  A recent paper (March 1993) has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs can be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting.  This has been an ellusive matter for researchers, and is one of the fundamental requirements for many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease. Up to now, only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to \\\"prove\\\" that the disease exists.  This paper is noteworthy in two other regards:  1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The dogs had episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5 months after exposure.  After this period, none showed any further clinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  So these are proven, clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous recovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course, observations longer than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn't have the same chronicity that some see in humans.  2)  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the vaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.  Of course, they want the world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine efficacy.  Anyway, maybe we will see some independent, scientifically sound evaluations of this vaccine in the next year or so. \",\" To boorishly reply to myself, I found I did have the Instrutech information already. The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:  A/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to 200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexed inputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the same time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate must be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bits at 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the national Instruments, at the same sample rate.  D/A: 16 bit converter. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. Each of the 4 output channels has its own converter.\",\"     I'd like to see this info as well.  As for wavelength, I think you're primarily going to find two - 880 nM +/- a bit, and/or 950 nM +/- a bit.  Usually it is about 10 nM either way.  The two most common I have seen were 880 and 950 but I have also heard of 890 and 940. I'm not sure that the 10 nM one way or another will make a great deal of difference.   Another suggestion - find a brand of TV that uses an IR remote, and go look at the SAMS photofact for it.  You can often find some very detailed schematics and parts list for not only the receiver but the transmitter as well, including carrier freq. specs. and tone decoding specs. if the system uses that.\",\"I am working on a project where we are going to be including both still and moving grapics within a database.

The best advice I've heard when buying monnitors is to actually look at the specific one you will buy (as opposed to model) since monitor manufacturing even from \\\"Big Names\\\" still tends to produce alot of monitors with visible defects.

FACT SHEET                    PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT  The President has approved a directive on \\\"Public Encryption Management.\\\"  The directive provides for the following:  Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology.  Encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of communications and data by preventing unauthorized access.  Advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications.  These advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the information age.  Despite its benefits, new communications technology can also frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated encryption can have this effect in the United States.  When exported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence activities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law enforcement and national security interests, while at the same time protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As encryption technology improves, doing so will require new, innovative approaches.  In the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.  To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect and decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted information, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:  INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS  The Attorney General of the United States, or her representative, shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which incorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed key-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from the American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to ensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow microcircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications hardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the security of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the government from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.  KEY-ESCROW  The Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate entities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits installed in communications equipment.  In each case, the key holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent unauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only to government agencies that have established their authority to acquire the content of those communications that have been encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney General shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such communications.  PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES  The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate U.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted with key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems that process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of a final standard within six months of this directive. \"]},\"selected\":{\"id\":\"1107\"},\"selection_policy\":{\"id\":\"1106\"}},\"id\":\"1066\",\"type\":\"ColumnDataSource\"},{\"attributes\":{\"fill_alpha\":{\"field\":\"__ALPHA__\"},\"fill_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"hatch_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"value\":0.5},\"line_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"size\":{\"field\":\"size\"},\"x\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_0\"},\"y\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_1\"}},\"id\":\"1086\",\"type\":\"Circle\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"id\":\"1036\",\"type\":\"DataRange1d\"},{\"attributes\":{\"fill_alpha\":{\"value\":0.1},\"fill_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"hatch_alpha\":{\"value\":0.1},\"hatch_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"value\":0.1},\"line_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"size\":{\"field\":\"size\"},\"x\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_0\"},\"y\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_1\"}},\"id\":\"1093\",\"type\":\"Circle\"},{\"attributes\":{\"fill_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"fill_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"hatch_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"hatch_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"line_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"size\":{\"field\":\"size\"},\"x\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_0\"},\"y\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_1\"}},\"id\":\"1082\",\"type\":\"Circle\"},{\"attributes\":{\"tools\":[{\"id\":\"1050\"},{\"id\":\"1051\"},{\"id\":\"1052\"},{\"id\":\"1053\"},{\"id\":\"1054\"},{\"id\":\"1055\"}]},\"id\":\"1058\",\"type\":\"Toolbar\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"id\":\"1104\",\"type\":\"UnionRenderers\"}],\"root_ids\":[\"1031\"]},\"title\":\"Bokeh Application\",\"version\":\"2.4.3\"}};\n",
