Do I need the Motif private header files and source,    or can I make do with the public headers that are provided?    \\\"Motif\\\" includes Xt in this context.  Yes.  You'll find it almost impossible without the source at this point.  It does depend on how ambitious you are and how concerned you are about compliance with the general interface and items like traversal.     One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have    already written, I am sure), and would therefore be probably be    a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class.    Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)?  I'm not sure what you're asking.  You could create something which is very much like a true multi-column list by placing several lists within a geometry manager,  and putting that manager within an automatic scrolled window.  This wouldn't be good for very large lists,  but you might consider this as an alternative.     Alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they    could sell me, this might save me from having to write one!    Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not    yet have the spec)?  Motif 1.2 does not have a multi-column list in it.  Have you looked at commercial sets?  There are also some PD  widget sets,  one of these might have a multi-column list you could port.  \",\":>> :>> As someone else has pointed out, why would the stove be in use on a warm  :>> day in Texas.  :> :>Do YOU eat all your food cold? : :Ever hear of electric ovens or microwaves?

Palestineans refused and will refuse such settlement that denies them their right of SELF-DETERMINATION. period.   Ok. I donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations. However, i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who have the right for it.  As for the Arabian and Palestinean voices that are against the current negotiations and the so-called peace process, they are not against peace per se, but rather for their well-founded predictions that Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank (and most probably the same for Golan Heights) back to the Arabs. An 18 months of \\\"negotiations\\\" in Madrid, and Washington proved these predictions. Now many will jump on me saying why are you blaming israelis for no-result negotiations. I would say why would the Arabs stall the negotiations, what do they have to loose ?  Arabs feel that the current \\\"negotiations\\\" is ONLY for legitimizing the current status-quo and for opening the doors of the Arab markets for israeli trade and \\\"oranges\\\".

No, but I hear quite a bit about Christmas, and little if anything about Jesus.  Wouldn't this figure be more prominent if the holiday were really associated to a high degree with him?

Chad\",\"This is turning into a FAQ   Here is how to violate your Quadra 700 warranty and install your own memory.  1)  Insert usual disclaimer here   2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and     hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static     precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do     this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back  of the mac.   3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the     tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.     The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the     tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may     also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power     supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you     need release.   4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon     SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable     leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.     The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed     to release it.                                              5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount  6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A     phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop     it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful     here.  7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the     right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding  posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then  lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.  8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM     slots.  9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to     gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their  chips facing the front of the motherboard.       The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in  sets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely  and firmly into a fully upright position.   10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the     tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about  1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into  place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.     Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks     into place.   11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY     DRIVE CABLE.  12) Replace the phillips head screw  13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.  14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount\",\"Hi there, I'm having a bizarre video problem within Windows 3.1.  I have a 286 with a GVGA-16 video board.  I've been using the standard Windows VGA driver with other similarly configured computers.  I am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's screen.  The problem is that once Windows has been envoked, the colors start changing themselves.  At first I thought it was hardware, but if you open a full screen DOS program from within the Windows session, you don't have any problems until you get back to Windows - however, when you initially return to Windows, the original colors get refreshed properly.  Also, it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire, the design on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc.  The color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purple-ish black.  If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - the screen gets refreshed again.  If I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novell network, everything is fine.  I originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine I had just finished configuring, then from the net to this machine.  When I ran into problems, I deleted everything on this machine and the net, and tried bouncing it again.  When that didn't work, I tried reloading Windows to no avail.  Any thoughts on things to check out?  I am totally baffled!  Thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction!\",\" Undoubtedly it does, to maintain such a weight.

The one most obviously applicable to cryptography (key selection) is to be able to specify the \\\"similarity\\\" of matches in the data.  For example say you make up a password/phrase of \\\"qimwe7l\\\". Of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not in any dictionary or word list.  But how *close* is it to en entry that could be varied by some \\\"crack\\\" program to brute-force search for it?  You use agrep to find out.  Looking with argument for none, one or two errors, no matches.  Good so far.  But   agrep -3 \\\"qimwe7l\\\" bigwordandphraselist  finds that the pattern \\\"qimwe7l\\\" is too close to the pattern \\\"imsel\\\" (part of \\\"himself\\\" and a host of others), to be of any cryptographic value as a key.  An error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of letters like \\\"teh\\\" for \\\"the\\\".  A minimally acceptable password would have to pass as *least* level 3 in order not immediately ruled-out as even a remote possibility of being a good password. (In real cryptographic use, my personal passphrases clear at *least* level 8 on my rather large [>80 meg] word and phrase lists.)   And for searching for key words in human-typed data (lots o' typos) the tool is unexcelled.  For example, For example, say I want to find out what people think about Gibson's SF book \\\"Neuromancer\\\" in the huge SF-Lover's archives. Even with an error distance specification as small as of \\\"1\\\" I will find all those people who think the title was \\\"Necromancer\\\" or other common typos.  Why miss anything?  Also, the program can look for up to 30,000 patterns IN PARALLEL at Boyer-Moore (sublinear) speeds.  Great for a NSA wannabe to look for your name, terrorists names, special Tagalog or religious words, etc. in the news or e-mail spool directories.  You can even search for ciphertext by using, say, 30,000 random three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts that don't score the X chi-square 'birthday' hits on message size Y.  You think some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changing the pattern on you?  No problem.  Try agrep -p NSA to find NSA, National Security Agency, NSecAg, No Such Agency, National Scrabble Association, N*S*A, etc.  You can also specify \\\"fixed\\\" areas: looking for license plate XYZ123 when you know that the letters are correct, you might say:  agrep -2 <XYZ>123 licenseplatedatabase  will find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors (addition, substitution, deletion) in the number area.  You can also \\\"weight\\\" the relative \\\"cost\\\" for substiutions, additions, or deletion errors.  For example, when searching DNA patterns for a particular protein combination, you might know that some kinds of damage cause the \\\"A\\\" nucelotide to drop out more than other errors... you could adjust for this bias by setting -Dc where you set the \\\"deletion cost\\\" to count as \\\"c\\\" errors.  A steganographic use (I even used \\\"agrep -2 \\\"<steg>eograp\\\" E\\\" just now to find the correct spelling!) would be to intentionally introduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext and then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe.  Lots of possibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext...  Also with agrep's powerful extraction options it makes it easy to abstract the \\\"hits\\\" into a useful form.  For example,  agrep -d \\\"^From\\\" 'PGP;(passphrase|Zimmerman|NSA)'  says output the entire mail record, delimited by 'From' that contains 'PGP' and contains either 'passphrase', 'Zimmerman', or 'NSA'.  And agrep has been measured an order-of-magnitude faster than the second-best similarity tool publicly available.  As usual, I will be glad to e-mail the source and docs to those who reqest them by e-mail IF they cannot do an anonymous FTP.  Get this now. It is too powerful to stay in the hands of the NSA.

In my follow-up to Jason Smith's posting, I will address some issues that have caused misunderstanding:     Yes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not escape your notice.   The correct word is 'likely'. There is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence, but not proved - no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense.  However, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can _predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories science has come up with have passed this test, including the Big Bang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc. It does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere 'best fits' for the data.     Well, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science requires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if the theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason. Disbelievers are not punished.    This is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_? My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is unable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God.   Yes, I know that one can't believe without God's help; Luther makes this quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. I'm afraid this does not change my situation.      (deletions)    No, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy, either something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody would ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but actually no existing being could give an answer.   Imagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also ask: \\\"Why nothing exists?\\\" This is equivalent to my counter-question, \\\"why nothing exists in nothingness\\\".   Now, \\\"why anything exists\\\" is equivalent to \\\"why something exists in somethingness\\\".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post.   I do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence, in general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still leave open the question \\\"why this, and not that\\\", and this is where theistic explanations come in.  Science cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being's existence.   This is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not? Also, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has no meaning in His case.   If I am for a reason, I've yet failed to see what it would be.  From our perspective, it looks like 'I' exist for truly random reasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can I believe there is any better reason for my existence?   Yes, I am satisfied with this reason, until I find something better. My 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect, I have to admit, but I am patient.    No, it doesn't, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists, for an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this should not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.   It is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question  \\\"why do I exist, in particular\\\" is _not_ an invalid question - this is not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to tell, and I can't just believe in any given explanation instead of another, especially since I found I was deluding myself.    I think \\\"pre-existence\\\" is an oxymoron. There is no time 'outside' of this spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that  perspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who are inside it.    No. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think philosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not knowable?   This is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous other questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base my faith on.   I think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves, \\\"why do I believe\\\" or \\\"why I don't believe\\\".   Petri \",\" Do you have a basis for this claim?

In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000 and that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops, British Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There are also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here it's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid without a pair of skates.  And before you say \\\"what does he know? He's from California.\\\" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia, a town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio play by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were the last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was on skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational hockey for about 35 years.    Lack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for the Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended, cost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club dues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues cover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless the city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.  By the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the \\\"inner city\\\" areas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an industrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther King, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown (I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west of 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town. Dublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive to run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice time expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them give you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and include the resurfacing time in the fee.  \",\"OK, here's something for all of those people who think cops are always more responsible then the rest of the population.

(AP) -- A police officer afraid he would be fired for allegedly assaulting a teen-ager walked into an auto body shop wher the youth worked, said \\\"You're going to die\\\" and fatally shot him and two others, police said.  A fourth youth was wounded.  A fifth escaped injury by hiding under a car.  The wounded youth ran about two blocks to a house after the shooting at about midnight Tuesday and called police.  He was hospitalized in satisfactory condition Wednesday.  Suspended police officer Robert Sabetta, 23, of Cranston, was arrested at gunpoint over three hours after the shooting at Wilson's Auto Enterprises in Foster, a rural town of about 4,000 people in northwest Rhode Island.

I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have some of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.  The main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to turn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple polygons). For example, in the letter \\\"O\\\" there are two outlines:   1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)  2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.  One common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply  connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \\\"polygon with holes\\\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.  I do not want to use this simplistic system since:   1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple   matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for   some fancy fonts).  2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.  From my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as is done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.  My question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygons.  Another question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create bevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these subjects but I can't tell which method is the best to implement.  Thanks for any pointers.  --> Rob Lansdale \",\"  Let's see...

In addition, the PEXt toolkit by Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com) is  available on export as PEXt.tar.Z; it includes a PEX widget making it easier to include PEX in Xt-based programs.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  86)  Where can I get an X-based TeX or DVI previewer?   The xtex previewer for TeX files is available from a number of archive  sites, including uunet; the current version is usually on ftp.cs.colorado.edu (128.138.204.31) in SeeTeX-2.18.5.tar.Z; pre-converted fonts are also on that  machine. The distribution all includes \\\"mftobdf\\\" which converts PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format, where they can then be compiled for use by your local X server.   The xdvi dvi-previewer is fairly comprehensive and easy to use. It is  also available from a number of sites, including uunet and export.lcs.mit.edu; current version is patchlevel 16 [12/92].  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  87)  Where can I get an X-based troff previewer?   X11R4 has two previewers for device-independent troff: the supported  client xditview, and the contributed-but-well-maintained xtroff. An earlier  version of xtroff also appeared on the R3 contributed source. xditview is also in the R5 distribution.  In addition, the xman client can be used to preview troff documents which use the -man macros (i.e. man pages).  If psroff is used its output can be viewed with a PostScript previewer.  In addition:   xproof, an X previewer for ditroff has been contributed by Marvin  Solomon (solomon@cs.wisc.edu); version 3.5 is available on export in  contrib/xproof*.  [8/90]   Elan Computer Group (CA: 415-964-2200) produces eroff, a modified  troff implementation, and Elan/Express, an X11 eroff previewer.   SoftQuad (416-963-8337; USA only 800-387-2777, mail@sq.uu.net or mail@sq.com) offers SoftQuad Publishing Software, including a substantially- rewritten troff formatter, a better intermediate language with backwards  compatibility, and an X11[R3,R4] previewer. (This is the package adopted by  AT&T's own MIS department, and used in and re-sold by many parts of AT&T).  [information from Ian Darwin, SoftQuad (ian@sq.com) 3/90]   Image Network (1-800-TOXROFF; CA: 415-967-0542) offers the Xroff  package, which includes a fine modified troff implementation and a set of  X11-based page previewers.

A new release of the DIRT interface builder by Richard Hesketh works  with X11R5 and includes some support for the Motif widget set. From the README:   This builder allows the interactive creation and rapid prototyping of X user   interfaces using the X Toolkit and a number of Widget Sets.  Dirt generates   \\\"Wc - Widget Creation\\\" resource files and this distribution also includes the   Widget Creation Library (version 1.06, with the exception of the demos and   Mri/Ari source code) with the kind permission of its author David E. Smyth. Check dirt.README, dirt.A2.0.tar.Z, and dirt.PS.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.   The InterViews 3.0.1 C++ toolkit contains a WYSIWIG interface builder  called ibuild. ibuild generates code for an InterViews application complete  with Imakefile and an X-resource file. Documentation is /pub/papers/ibuild.ps  on interviews.stanford.edu (36.22.0.175).  Quest Windows's (408-496-1900) ObjectViews C++ package includes an interactive building tool.    Druid (Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development) runs on SPARC  machines using OSF/Motif 1.0; it is intended eventually to be a full UIMS but  apparently now has only support for creating the presentation components, for  which it generates C/UIL code.

In addition, Neuron Data (1 415 321-4488) makes Open Interface, a  window-system-independent object toolkit which supports interfaces which are  or resemble (supersets of) Mac, Windows, and Motif and Open Look; the package  includes an interface builder.         In addition, the GRAMMI builder supports the development of Ada/X  applications using its own set of objects which are planned to have a Motif  look.  GRAMMI is written in Ada and generates Ada specs and stub bodies.  (1-800-GRAMMI-1).   In addition, these non-WYSIWYG but related products may help for goals  of rapid prototyping of the application interface:   WCL: the Widget Creation Library. Basically describes the widget hierarchy and actions in a resources file; available from fine archive servers everywhere, including devvax.jpl.nasa.gov (128.149.1.143) in pub/. Wcl provides a very thin layer over Xt without any internal tweaking. Version 2.5 is current [3/93].  WINTERP: an Xlisp-based Motif toolkit allows for interpretive  programming. The copy on the R4 tape is outdated; get a copy off export or  email to winterp-source%hplnpm@hplabs.hp.com.   The Serpent UIMS permits the building of user-interfaces without  specific knowledge of coding but with an understanding of attributes being set on a particular [Motif] widget.  Beta Release 1.2 is available from  ftp.sei.cmu.edu (128.237.1.13) and can be found in /pub/serpent.  Serpent is  also available on export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.11) in /contrib/serpent.

MetaCard  is available via anonymous FTP from ftp.metacard.com, csn.org, or  128.138.213.21.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  89)  Where can I find X tools callable from shell scripts? I want to have a shell script pop up menus and yes/no dialog boxes if the user  is running X.   Several tools in the R3 contrib/ area were developed to satisfy these needs: yorn pops up a yes/no box, xmessage displays a string, etc. There are several versions of these tools; few, if any, have made it to the R4 contrib/  area, though they may still be available on various archive sites.  In addition, Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) has posted the xmenu package to comp.sources.x (\\\"v08i008: xmenu\\\") for 1-of-n choices.  [7/90]  Two versions of XPrompt have been posted to comp.sources.x, the latter being an unauthorized rewrite. [R. Forsman (thoth@reef.cis.ufl.edu), 1/91]  There is a version of XMenu available from comp.sources.x; it is being worked on and will likely be re-released.  xp-1.1.tar.Z, xpick-1.0.tar.Z and xzap-1.0.tar.Z on export's contrib/ are tools by Gerry.Tomlinson@newcastle.ac.UK which act as X versions of the  simple display and choice-making tools in K&P. [4/92]  xtpanel lets the user build a panel containing interactive objects such as buttons, sliders, text fields, etc., either from the command line or using a simple scripting language. It is available for anonymous ftp from  hanauma.Stanford.EDU (36.51.0.16) as pub/X/xtpanel.tar.Z and may also be found  in the alt.sources archives.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  90)  Where can I get an X-based debugger?   xdbx, an X interface to the dbx debugger, is available via ftp from  export. The current [1/91] version is 2.1 patchlevel 2.  An X interface to gdb called xxgdb is more like xdbx 2.1.2. It is part  of comp.sources.x volume 11 [2/91]; xxgdb-1.06.tar.Z is on export.  mxgdb is a Motif interface to gdb by Jim Tsillas  (jtsillas@bubba.ma30.bull.com); version 1.1.5 was released 1/93.  UPS is a source-level debugger which runs under the X11 and SunView window systems on Sun and DEC platforms.

How can I \\\"tee\\\" an X program identically to several displays?   There are several protocol multiplexer tools which provide for the  simultaneous display of X clients on any number of machines.  XMX (an X Protocol Multiplexor) is available from wilma.cs.brown.edu  (128.148.33.66) as pub/xmx.tar.Z It works independently of the server and does not affect the application being shared; it was developed for use in the electronic classroom.  XTV is a conference program which can be used to duplicate the \\\"chalkboard\\\" on several displays. Release 1 is available on the X11R5 contrib tapes; a more recent version is on ftp.cs.odu.edu as pub/wahab/XTV.r2.tar.Z.  SHX from Michael Altenhofen of Digital Equipment GmbH CEC Karlsruhe  also does this; it is a \\\"WYSIWIS\\\" (What You See Is What I See) package in the  context of a computer-based learning/training tool to provide online help from remote tutors but is also useful for general window sharing. Information:  shX@nestvx.enet.dec.com.

This FAQ includes information on a number of \\\"gotchas\\\" that can bite  you on particular system. However, the best source of general information on  building the X11 release is found in the Release Notes. The file is bundled  separately from the rest of the release, so if it's become separated from your  sources you can FTP another copy separately: the file RELNOTES.[ms,PS,TXT] at  the top of the distribution.

I used gcc to compile the whole distribution, but I get several segmentation faults when running X.   Note first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in any performance increase; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the 680x0 or VAX platforms.   Here is the problem: gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing  structures as arguments and returning them as function values, so when  gcc-compiled parts of X are linked with Sun-supplied functions that pass or  return structs, run-time errors occur.  Affected programs include rgb and  the server.   This is from the GCC manual:   On the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for   structures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument  list, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by   reference.   This really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet  supported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.   The convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and  `-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.  You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with  compilation flags.     Files which need to be compiled using cc include:   server/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c    rgb/rgb.c   In addition, several of the \\\"inet_\\\" functions use structs as args or return values:     clients/xhost/xhost.c    clients/xauth/gethost.c.  Calls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly  harmless as they don't involve structs.

When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error   \\\"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket.   Fatal server bug! no screens found.\\\"   Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do  this simple test:   #include <sys/ioctl.h>  SIOCGIFCONF  Run that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of  interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like  whitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your  fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc sources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are  identical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make  sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.    [courtesy der Mouse, mouse@LARRY.MCRCIM.MCGILL.EDU; 9/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  99)  What are these problems compiling X11R4 on the older Sun3? In mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c, we have found \\\"missing\\\" defines for  CG3AC_MONOLEN, CG3BC_MONOLEN, CG3AC_ENBLEN, CG3BC_ENBLEN. What should these be?   The R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add these lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile:         #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)         #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN         #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN         #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN   However, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so  references to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the  Imakefile.  [11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 100)  What are these problems compiling the X server on SunOS 4.1.1? The file <sundev/cg6reg.h> isn't being found.   Sun omitted <sundev/cg6reg.h> from SunOS 4.1.1. Remove the #include  from sunCG6C.c and replace it with the line   #define CG6_VADDR_COLOR   0x70016000 The file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied  from another distribution.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 101)  What are these problems using R4 shared libraries on SunOS 4? All of the executables that I try to run have the following results:  ld.so: libXmu.so.4: not found or even:  ld.so: call to undefined procedure __GetHostname from 0xf776a96c   If you are building with shared libraries on a Sun, remember that you  need to run \\\"ldconfig\\\" as root after installing the shared libraries (if you've installed X on a file-server, run it on the server's clients, too).  While  building and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid  linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those  distributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have  LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.   If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that  the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or  /usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked  statically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]  Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it attempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed. You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to most C compilers).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)  This is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in  X11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was  removed in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5 libraries only applied to the documented interface).    A workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4 or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.  [10/92; from Barry Margolin (barmar@think.com); 3/93 from Jeff Francis  (jpf@heliocentric.com)]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 103)  How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole?   There is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload) running under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using  shared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:  1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system administrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used by these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security  problems at your site.  2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).  3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths to the libraries.  [from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]  The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid program from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this  may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks.  Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?   On many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits  anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by  accessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps more annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console  display. Check the man page for fbtab(5).  [Thanks to Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca); 2/93.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 105)  TOPIC: BUILDING X PROGRAMS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 106)  What is Imake?   Imake is not a replacement for the make program; instead, it is a makefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro- processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles  suitable for building software on a particular system. Although it is not  specific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the  configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.  Imake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by which the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration files, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not  obvious.  There have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and R5 versions are different.   You can obtain information on imake from these sources:  - the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on using Imake to build X  - the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information  - on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4 guide to imake.  - the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim Fulton on an early version of Imake  - Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful  explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non- supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu in the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and  config-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby.  [7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email; mail a message body of \\\"send imake-stuff help\\\" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.  - see \\\"System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?\\\" by Dinah McNutt in the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.  - German readers should expect in June 1992 an article \\\"Das Meta-Make  / I make, you make / Schwerelos\\\" by Rainer Klute in \\\"iX  Multiuser-Multitasking-Magazin\\\", directed at application programmers needing to write Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The X Journal, issue 2:1.  - The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article on demystifying Imake.  - Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in  sasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.  [1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 107)  Where can I get imake?   Versions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier  version is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits  redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the  template and configuration files. There are no real standards for such  configuration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the  templates distributed with X11R5.  export contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake without picking up the entire distribution.  A stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in ftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?   If you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run \\\"xmkmf\\\". This is a  script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a  Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make,  which will use that new Makefile to compile the program.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines? When I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:  Undefined:  _XShapeQueryExtension  _XShapeCombineMask   These routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE) which was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular windows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will  only run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many  vendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case  they will display rectangular windows anyway.   In order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library  libXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes will be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do  not despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be  compiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X  libraries.  [from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 110)  What are these problems with \\\"_XtInherit not found\\\" on the Sun? When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the  error \\\"ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit\\\".   What you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to  get Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that  is both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting  _XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby  guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where  XtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally be called.   You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal Xt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere.   1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a  connection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called XtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your  program; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.  2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView  program. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command.    It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically, although this will certainly solve the problem.   [from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be);  11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 111)  Why can't I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X? I have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under  the current version of X, I get this message:  Undefined:  _XtScrollBarSetThumb  _XtTextSetInsertionPoint  _XtTextReplace   There were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition to the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4 release notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but are part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*. [10/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?   The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one window to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the window manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are called \\\"hints\\\" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you can use something like the following:          XWMHints wmhints;         ...         wmhints.flags = InputHint;         wmhints.input = True;         XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)  If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput  resource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have source, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.  Certain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having  this done.    If you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource to your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant.  OpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true  [mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?   You can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case.   For most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so  long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in  which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can  sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may  be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order to give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window  manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing; this surely leads to future compatibility problems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?    There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the  Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development  under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional  development. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive  application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to \\\"test just  this one little thing\\\" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that  puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for quick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4  distributions, and the Xlib \\\"Hello World\\\" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and  R4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4  Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x   by Glenn Widener of Tektronix.  [3/90]   In addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute  showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display  connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?   The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is sensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:  {  Arg args[3];  int i;  int sensitive;  /* oops; wrong data type */  i=0;  XtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;  XtGetValues(widget, args, i );  ...  }  But XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte;  declaring the variable \\\"sensitive\\\" as Boolean works properly. This problem  comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types  Dimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar  problems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you use the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page. [11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?   You're probably trying to use these functions from application code. They should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a  parent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising  functions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use  only by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.  The only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources. Although this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the  widgets' data becoming corrupted.  [The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be  avoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?   Although there are various details of the current implementation of the Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the \\\"new\\\" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves? What should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics are defined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old  widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired  resources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in  creating a new widget.   Note that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  David B.

So in sum and to beat a dead horse:  (1) When the outputs of a cone are matched for number of absorbed photons _irrespective_ of the absorbed photons wavelength, the cone outputs are _indistinguishable_.  (2) Cones are simply detectors with different spectral sensitivities and are not any more \\\"color sensitive\\\" than are rods, ommatidia or other photoreceptors.

My brother was living with someone like that and things were almost as bad (although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due to other problems with the relationship).  Anyway, the best thing to do would be to get everyone in the same room together (optimally in a room with nothing breakable), lock the door behind you, throw the key out underneath the door (just as far as the longest hand can reach.  You would like to get out after the conclusion, I would imagine), and hash things out.  More than likely, there will be screaming, crying, and possibly hitting (unless of course someone decided to bring some rope to tie people down).  Some of the best strategies in keeping things calmer would include:    have each individual own their own statements (ie, I feel that this relationship is hurting everyone involved because.... or I really don't understand where you're coming from.)    reinforce statements by paraphrasing, etc. (ie, So you think that we did this because of...?

Guaranteed, in a situation like this, there is going to be some gunnysacking (re-hashing topics which were assumed resolved, but were truly not and someone feels someone else is to blame).  However, this should be kept to a minimum and simply ask for forgiveness or apologize about each situation WITHOUT holding a smoldering grudge.    The relationship really can work.  It's just a matter of keeping things smooth and even.  It's sort of like making a peace treaty between warring factions:  you can't give one side everything; there must be a compromise.

Where were they?                  An Appeal to Mankind  During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums, documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.  The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace.  The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.  Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland. Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan. Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives  of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.  One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection  of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance, for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled, its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over  the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the USSR and the United States.   One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent  events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on Azerbaijan.  It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we  are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic  Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.  But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000 Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the  neighboring lands.  The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales, suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.  But what about the lives of seven million human beings? If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their  colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other attributes?  All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

The Armenians are Christians, the Azerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved by the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights.   Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims at 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole thing has now gone entirely too far.   They already did. The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians  78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this  time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the  plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs.   Report taken from The New York Times, Tuesday, March 3, 1992                      MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED       Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today  of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh,  a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.      The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed 1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and  massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered mountain passes.      But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani reports of a massacre.                           Scalping Reported      Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them  from retrieving more bodies.      \\\"Women and children have been scalped,\\\" said Assad Faradshev, an aide to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. \\\"When we began to pick up bodies, they began firing at us.\\\" are lying there like flocks of sheep.

One of the advantages and draw-backs of requiring proof on the part of the government before they may take action against citizens.  (and part of the reason some of us believe weapons should be available.)          We are not arguing the absolute sanctity of the U.S. Constitution.  In fact, the fillibuster we're talking about isn't *in* the Constitution.  I objected to your suggestion that the Senate wasn't intended to exercise the power it was clearly given.          I'll point out again that Reagan only had a Republican Majority in the Senate during his first term, and his coalition in the House came apart at about the same time.  Bush never had any real support in Congress.         The real point is that everybody, *everywhere* got their pork, from the big corporations to the guy I saw last night leaving a convenience store with an armful of junk-food he'd bought with food stamps.  (He spent more in food stamps on junk than I *make* in a week and I'm not on government assitance.)          Lessee, let's pull out the old Almanac.         In 1980, total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billion dollars.  In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase of approx. 884 billion dollars.         In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars.  In 192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars. That leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccounted for.  (This represented an increase of 230%)         In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs, Housing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare) cost 86.5 billion dollars.  In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, or more than national defense started.  (This represented an increase of 230%)         In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars on Medicare.  In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars.  (an increase of 368%)         In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housing credits and subsidies of that like.  In 1992 it was 87 billion.         In 1980, Health care services and research was 23 billion dollars.  In 1992, it was 94 billion dollars.         Agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion.         Science, up 11 billion to 16 billion.         Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion.         Education up 14 billion to 45 billion.         Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion.         Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion.              About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under  the Energy category, primarily under \\\"Supply,\\\" and \\\"Community Development,\\\" in the area of \\\"disaster relief,\\\" and between the two of them represent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars.         Where *was* this huge diversion?          Not that's a stretch.  If the current government was pushed by the President to create this mess, wouldn't one expect it to begin to equalize once the pressure is gone?          Only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want to continue. I see very little positive about it.          The Constitution was *designed* to frustrate the democratic process, so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting what they wanted by the time it happened.  Nor do I see putting the brakes on the \\\"democratic process\\\" an inherently bad thing.  Califronia's riding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense it gets worse.          Sometimes, or perhaps most of the time, the people should be told, \\\"no,\\\" and pointed to their local government.

I haven't *based* my argument against raw democracy on the Constitution.  I've tried to explain why it isn't a good idea.  The only time I've referred to the Constitution is to point out it doesn't contain the restrictions on the veto and the Senate you appear to believe were \\\"meant,\\\" but just didn't make it in there.              The Constitution doesn't *contain* the 41% fillibuster rule. I only believe that the rule is a good idea.  You cn't dismiss that as venerating the Constitution because it isn't *in* the Constitution.\",\"   I disagree: every proposition needs a certain amount of evidence  and support, before one can believe it. There are a miriad of factors for  each individual. As we are all different, we quite obviously require  different levels of evidence.   As one pointed out, one's history is important. While in FUSSR, one  may not believe a comrade who states that he owns five pairs of blue jeans.  One would need more evidence, than if one lived in the United States. The  only time such a statement here would raise an eyebrow in the US, is if the  individual always wear business suits, etc.   The degree of the effect upon the world, and the strength of the  claim also determine the amount of evidence necessary. When determining the  level of evidence one needs, it is most certainly relevent what the  consequences of the proposition are.     If the consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, please explain  why one would not accept: The electro-magnetic force of attraction between  two charged particles is inversely proportional to the cube of their  distance apart.    Remember, if the consequences of the law are not relevent, then we can not use experimental evidence as a disproof. If one of the  consequences of the law is an incongruency between the law and the state of  affairs, or an incongruency between this law and any other natural law,  they are irrelevent when theorizing about the \\\"Truth\\\" of the law.   Given that any consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, including  the consequence of self-contradiction or contradiction with the state of  affiars, how are we ever able to  judge what is true or not; let alone find \\\"The Truth\\\"?     By the way, what is \\\"Truth\\\"? Please define before inserting it in  the conversation. Please explain what \\\"Truth\\\" or \\\"TRUTH\\\" is. I do think that  anything is ever known for certain.

I can't : see it having trouble keeping up.  His pcplus for dos works great,  re: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93  This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2 or DOS apps not running under Windows.  One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that their RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST) discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or FAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer than with the old 2400bps modem.   There are three reasons for the problem:  1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most    PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the    operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high    interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and    the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded    environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.  2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and    interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely    than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you    are losing data, you may be advised that \\\"you need to upgrade to a    16550\\\". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance    about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the    store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve    my own problem had never heard the term \\\"16550\\\" and many didn't even    know what a UART was.  3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade    your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience    errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers    don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this    regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications    like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem    by themselves.  If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem card.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they are to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one. Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.   The Hardware Situation.  The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250 or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace them).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft diagnostic program \\\\WINDOWS\\\\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before* bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.  The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to 460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access cycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info, see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.  So, what UART component do you have?  Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM board or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with the numbers \\\"8250\\\" or \\\"16450\\\", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI, and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE your VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket COM board.  If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The \\\"N\\\" chip is the normal 40-pin dual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550 chips without the \\\"A\\\" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).  Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various IC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips: National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552 Chips&Technology:       82C607 Texas Instruments:      t16c550a Silicon Systems:        73M550 VLSI                    16C550 TurboCom warns about the pre-\\\"A\\\" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550, says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70 systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).  If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after- market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you may be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to either disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to COM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).  Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology MCT-AIO+ card from:  JDR Microdevices 2233 Samaritan Drive San Jose  CA  95124 (800) 538-5000 voice US (408) 559-1200 voice other (800) 538-5005 FAX US  The MCT-AIO+ (and the \\\"+\\\" is important) sells for $89.95.

Meanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports, and am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based 8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set the internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.   The Software Situation  Simply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun problems.  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the 16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1 drivers have the following limitations:  - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.  - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt    rate of 10x during uploads.  - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2    more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).  - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.    With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1    or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would    be effective.  - The API won't accept rates above \\\"CBR_128000\\\".  - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even    if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit    from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.  - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.  - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.  - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port    speed options above 19200 bps.  These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0). Rumors suggest they \\\"may\\\" be solved in Windows \\\"4.0\\\".  You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of \\\"TurboCom\\\", current version 1.2, from:  Bio-Engineering Research Pacific CommWare Division 180 Beacon Hill Lane Ashland  OR   97520-9701 (503) 482-2744 voice (503) 482-2627 FAX (503) 482-2633 BBS MCImail:    344-5374 CompuServe: 71521,760  Price was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit cards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom but as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software company per se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for an in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a market for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They recently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.  I now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my datacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps when linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O. Uploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts are still using antique UARTs and drivers.  Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the Windows APIs and dialog boxes.  I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you do the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC) standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another 16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving system or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all by itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above 115,200 may still be risky.  Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to buy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a 16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of TurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of \\\"Windows Sources\\\" magazine. I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a \\\"power user\\\" whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems.   Closing Soapbox Comments  The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface, the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation vendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was subsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the exception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent I/O.  You may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this situation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect cries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs \\\"sort of\\\" work today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a hardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that use that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.

Uranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb.  Right now, there are mines closing because they can't compete with places like Cigar Lake in Canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards to the mines, who work in shielded vehicles).  Plenty of other sources (for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before uranium reached $200/lb.  \\\"Demand and supply balance will collapse\\\" is nonsense.  Supply and demand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century? Not bloody likely.  New nuclear reactors are not being built at a sufficient rate.  Uranium from seawater is interesting, but it's a long term project, or a project that the Japanese might justify on grounds of self-sufficiency.\",\"  If not for the lack of extraneously capitalized words, I'd swear that McElwaine had changed his name and moved to Cal Poly.

Me, my wife, a friend, his wife, and his 2 kids were hiking in a totally desolate mountain area.  All of a sudden, large rocks began raining down on us.  Looking up, we saw at least 3 punks gleefully letting loose rocks from what was an obvious stash.  They were a couple hundred feet above us. Meanwhile, the women and kids were screaming and running for cover and the punks were shrieking with laughter.  Me and my friend yelled for them to knock it off.  They responded that we should \\\"Get f***ed!\\\".  Me and my friend drew our pistols and fired a couple of times into the trees above their heads.  They ran.

Go for it.  I have yet to see anybody justify the prohibition on drugs and the ensuing War On Drugs.  In the world of *.politics here on Usenet, it is YOU that is crazy.  ANYBODY--who gives the matter any thought beyond reading headlines---cannot justify this atrocity, this all out war on individual rights.  Just _TRY_ to justify the War On Drugs, I _DARE_ you!   Once again, in chorus: WHY is this \\\"stupid\\\"?   The above paragraph is gibberish--that all I can make of it...  \",\"I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and word has it that something similar is on its way here.  Since we apparently don't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing cameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests are going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with the video being piped into a command center they're building somewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers or cheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large multi-colored status displays will show the various routes using different colors to represent the various average speeds for each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front of the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic status to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently also looking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to providing continuous audio from this system.  In the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data on traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the system is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it will be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read \\\"cheap\\\").  We also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP audio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal reports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle receivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is applicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using some other TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your stereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information. I believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle receivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly fees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers don't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely true), they likely have no investment in keeping the system up and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You may have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing more, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;)  I think we'd all be interested in a summary post if you get more info on how the LA system is networked and paid for.\",\" Tom's right about this.  It's only a grantable right if the granter has the will and the ability to stop anyone from taking it away from you. Never mind the legal status.   Nick's right about this.  It's always easier to obtain forgiveness than permission.  Not many people remember that Britain's King George III expressly forbid his american subjects to cross the alleghany/appalachian mountains.  Said subjects basically said, \\\"Stop us if you can.\\\"  He couldn't.   That's how the USA started.  Of course, that's also how the Bolivarian Republic started (ca. 1800-1820) in central america.  It didn't have quite the staying power of the USA.  I'm sure there are more examples of going far away and then ignoring authority, but none jump to mind right now.

An On/Off Road Rally consists of the following:     1. An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of       directions and clues guiding participates around the        Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course       based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will       be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which       they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the       number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately        lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is        set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points       will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions       or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,       basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.     2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants       will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.       Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles       without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half       the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle       unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will       divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified       4x4s can run the course.         At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring   participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.   Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.  * This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles   so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be   street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section   of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper   from their vehicle :) .

Similar prizes have influenced aerospace  development before. The $25k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of  Saint Louis venture to his financial backers.  If memory serves, the $25k prize would not have been enough to totally  reimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic projects (such as  Fokker's, Nungesser and other multi-engine projects). However Lindbergh  ultimately kept his total costs below that amount.  But I strongly suspect that his Saint Louis backers had the foresight to  realize that much more was at stake than $25,000.

I'am arguing about  : the Armenian-Nazi colaboration during World War II. Any comment?   It could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941,  while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration  camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian  battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had  grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the  cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party  leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by  this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed  and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the  members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of  extermination of the Jews.  This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \\\"encore\\\" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.  Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province of Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia claimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia (around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it had already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who could be expected to oppose their plans.   On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian and military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even  though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over 60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the  British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left  the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few  Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One British soldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring.   Rawlinson wired to his superiors,   \\\"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in  independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops   being without discipline and not being under effective control,  atrocities were constantly being committed.\\\"    Come again?  : \\\"These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...

All barracks buildings of Erzincan, the cavalry barracks in Erzurum,  the Government building and Army Corps Headquarters are among those  burnt. In short, both cities are burnt, destroyed and trees cut down.   As to the people of these cities:   All people old enough to use weapons rounded up, taken to the Sarikamis  direction for road building and were slaughtered. The remaining people,  were subject to cruelties and murder by Armenians following the   withdrawal of Russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown   into wells, burnt in houses, mutilated by bayonets, their abdomens  ripped open in slaughterhouses, their lungs and livers torn out, girls  and women hung up by their hair, after all kinds of devilish acts.

The people are hungry and in poverty, for whatever they had  has been taken away from them, their lands left uncultivated.   The people have just been able to exist with some provisions found in  stores left over from the Russians. The villages round Erzincan and   Erzurum are in the worst condition. Some villages on the road, have   been leveled to the ground, leaving no stone, the people completely  massacred.

All is not lost, however, as you still might belong spiritually to the Church by your desire to belong to it.  As you said, only God can judge the condition of a man's soul.  About judgment, on the other hand, St. Paul  1 Cor 5:12) urges Christians to judge their fellow Christians.  Following the Apostle's teaching, I judge that you should reconsider    returning to the Christian fold and embrace the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  He is the God who lives.    Concerning what you were told about non-believers when you were a catholic, that is true.  As I have posted before, Vatican II (Lumen Gentium, II,    n. 16) teaches: \\\"Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Chruch, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and moved by grace, try in their actions to do His will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may achieve eternal salvation.\\\"    Responding to your solicitation for opinions on the thinking processes of God, the best I can do is refer you to Scripture.

I've just finished reading S414, and have several questions about the Brady bills (S414 and HR1025).  1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill?      What is the status of these bills?  I've heard they're \\\"in committee\\\".      How close is that to being made law?  2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar.  Are there any important    differences I missed?  3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes:   A. S414 doesn't specify an \\\"appeals\\\" process to wrongful denial during      the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?)  (S414 has an appeals      process once the required instant background check system is established,      but not before).   B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approving      using existing records (so who would I sue in \\\"A\\\" above to have an      inaccurate record corrected?)   C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person      can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer (CLEO) of an      immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member.      But S414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a \\\"threat\\\", nor does      it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception      statement. True?  Have I misunderstood?  Any other 'holes?  4. With just S414, what's to stop a person with a \\\"clean\\\" record from    buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks?    At minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this?     'Seems at min. a \\\"gun counting\\\" scheme would be needed    (e.g., \\\"John Doe owns N guns\\\").  So, if S414 passes, I wouldn't be surprised    to see legislation for stricter, harder-to-forge I.D.'s plus national gun    registration, justified by a need to make the Brady bill work.  Please comment.  I'm mainly interested in specific problems with the current legislation--I don't mean to start a general discussion of the merits of any/all waiting-period bills ever proposed.\",\" [ stuff deleted ]    |> Are you calling names, or giving me a title?

Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to    protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing    Palestinean human rights.

He works hard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an offensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed to make the team next year.  #3 DAVID WILLIAMS  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, free agent from New Jersey Grade:  C/C-  IMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92, playing a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and good defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City, was good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that '91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he was prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last year.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.  #4 JAYSON MORE  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft Grade:  B+  After being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp before '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not particularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then, proceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most reliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash. Offensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73 games), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.  #5 NEIL WILKINSON  Season: 4th Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  B-  Wilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However, partially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25 games total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed even when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners; that is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if he can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.  #6 SANDIS OZOLINSH  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft Grade:  I (A)  At the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers), Ozolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury in that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games), but he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points), which, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from their defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still susceptible to so-called \\\"rookie mistakes,\\\" but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back from his injuries, he is ready to be a star.  #19 DOUG ZMOLEK  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  B  Zmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks to play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but after being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points). He was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the team; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to become a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and defensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.\",\"This game would have been great as part of a double-header on ABC or ESPN; the league would have been able to push back-to-back wins by Le Magnifique and The Great One.

Why? : Viola is younger, and is left handed (how many left handed starters does : Toronto have?  Well, I agree that Viola is a better signing.  However, why does everyone say that you want lefthanded starters?  I understand lefthanded spot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters than lefthanded batters.  I just don't understand why people insist on lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium). Most batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters. I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams may be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's.  However, this is probably only a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters for this reason during the regular season.  I think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of whether they are lefties or righties.  Lefthanded starters tend to have higher ERA's than righthanded starters, precisely because managers go out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of the platoon advantage).

There \\\"....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies.\\\"          Thanx in advance... Shaz....  [I'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions. The primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style of the translation.  It's pretty unusual to see significant differences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying text.  That's because before printing, manuscripts were copied by hand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the original, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are generally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are something like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved, but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don't think there's much uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of translating is free of error.  But I also don't think there's enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that it has much practical effect.  Whether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot topic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it (though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details that don't affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there being multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in all the versions.  I'm surprised to find a reference to this on the title page though.  What version are you talking about?  I've been referring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get referenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been editions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into single narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor objects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible has long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making editions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from a variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine one of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all inaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it's not any edition that's widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is. (Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It's been alleged that a few translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize inconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best, I'm afraid.)\",\" [Stuff deleted]     Will, there has been a lot of discussion going on about this over in s.r.c.b-s. I will make the case here though and try to help you out:  8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9).  Yes, it is by God's grace and our faith that we are saved.  We are not saved by what we do.  However,  15 If ye love me, keep my commandments. (John 14:15).  Keeping Christ's commandments is a \\\"work\\\" per se, and a demonstration of our love for him.  Also,  6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. 7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? 8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: 9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down. (Luke 13:6-9).  Again,  16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. (John 15:16).  It is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit.  What is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being love, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest in the actions that we carry out.  If a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things Christ commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith.  Asking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your pants is more important.  Good works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith, true faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable above speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs commands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit, then we shall be uprooted just like the tree.   It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for days about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a building and not hit the ground.  In other words, I can sit and tell you all day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really don't have that faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the test.  Words and talk mean nothing.  I could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, but this should be sufficient.  Hope it helped.

Lately, I've been seeing people with the old portables, and they're selling for $300 LESS that the PB 100s. What I want to know is: what are the differences between them? All I know is that the Portable is heavier, but the PB100 doesn't have an internal drive. Here's what I NEED to know:  Does the portable support Appletalk/network connections? What's the CPU inside a Portable? (68000?) DOES THE PORTABLE SUPPORT SYSTEM 7????????? What's the maximum memory capacity of the Portable? Can you still get  RAM (meaning: does it use special SIMMS?) What kind of internal HD does it use? Does the Portable have a better screen?

The xpert mailing list is the general, public mailing list on X maintained by the X Consortium. The mailings are gatewayed, so xpert is almost  identical to the comp.windows.x Usenet newsgroup.    *** If you get comp.windows.x, you don't need to  ***  *** be added to the xpert mailing list.   ***   Otherwise, you can join the list to receive X information  electronically. It is best to find a local distribution; perhaps someone within your company is already receiving the mailing. As a last resort, send mail to  xpert-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with a valid return electronic address.    The xannounce mailing list carries major X announcements, such as new releases (including public patches from MIT), public reviews, adoption of  standards by the MIT X Consortium, and conference announcements.  It does NOT  carry advertisements, source code, patches, or questions.  If you already  receive the Usenet news group comp.windows.x.announce or the xpert mailing  list, you don't need to be added to the xannounce mailing list.  Otherwise, to  subscribe, send a request to xannounce-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu. Note: Only  redistribution addresses will be accepted for this list -- i.e. no personal  addresses. If you wish to receive xannounce yourself, please contact your mail  administrator to set up a local redistribution list and to put you on it.    comp.windows.x.apps is not gatewayed to a mailing list.   In addition, the X Consortium sponsors these public lists:   bug-clx         CLX bug reports and discussions   x-ada           X and ada   x11-3d          people interested in X and 3d graphics   ximage          people interested in image processing and X   xvideo          discussion of video extensions for X  To subscribe to one of these lists, assuming no-one in your  organization already receives it, send mail to <list>-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with the Subject line including the name of the LIST in caps and the request \\\"addition request\\\".  In the body of the message be sure to give an address for  your local distribution which is accessible from MIT (eddie.mit.edu).

A mailing list discussing multi-threaded Xlib can be subscribed to at mt-xlib-request@xsoft.xerox.com.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   5)  How can I meet other X developers?    O'Reilly and Associates sponsors a mailing list for the use of X user  group organizers; subscribe by sending to listserv@ora.com the message  \\\"subscribe xgroups your@internet.address\\\".   Local area X user's groups are listed in Issue 4 of O'Reilly's X  Resource journal; a list may also be available from xug@ics.com.   The French X User Group is called AFUX and is based in Sophia Antipolis by CERICS. Information can be obtained from Miss Vasseur or Miss Forest; BP  148; 157, rue Albert Einstein; 06561 Valbonne Cedex; Phone: +33 93 95 45 00 /  45 01; Fax: +33 93 95 48 57.  [10/90]   The European X User Group was formed in 1989 to represent X users in  Europe.  It holds technical conferences at regular intervals. The EXUG also  publishes a regular newsletter which is distributed free of charge to members.  The EXUG also runs a email mailing list for members which is frequently used to address issues of European interest in X. The EXUG can be contacted at P.Whitehead@cc.ic.ac.uk, +44 (071) 225 8754, fax +44 (071) 823 9497.   GXUGiV is the German X User's Group in Vorbereitung (\\\"in preparation\\\") being formed for X programmers and users; it is associated with the EXUG. All interested should contact Olaf Heimburger (+49 30 7 79 54 64; and at mcvax!unido!tub!olaf).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   6)  What related FAQs are available?   Liam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posts a FAQ on Open Look to  comp.windows.open-look.    Jan Newmarch (jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) posts a FAQ on Motif to  comp.windows.x.motif.  Peter Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) posts a FAQ for comp.windows.x.intrinsics; it is on export in contrib/FAQ-Xt.  Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca) posts to comp.windows.x a FAQ on  maximizing the performance of X.  Steve Kotsopoulos (steve@ecf.toronto.edu) posts to comp.windows.x a FAQ about using X on Intel-based Unix systems.  The FAQ in alt.binaries.pictures contains information on viewing images with X and on massaging image formats.  The FAQ in comp.mail.mh (gatewayed to MH-users@ics.uci.edu) includes a  section on xmh.  The FAQ in comp.lang.lisp contains information on several interface tools and toolkits.  There exists a PEX/PHiGS FAQ.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   7)  How do I ask a net-question so as to maximize helpful responses?   When asking for help on the net or X mailing lists, be sure to include  all information about your setup and what you are doing.  The more specific you are, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without all the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are able to respond at all.   Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it  from. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system, give details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S  version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to  mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.   Then tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what you expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the  exact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote  doesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary  (just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available?   The trade magazines (Unix World, Unix Review, Computer Language, etc.) are publishing more articles on X.  Two X-specific publications include:   - O'Reilly and Associates publishes \\\"The X Resource: A Practical  Journal of the X Window System\\\" (103 Morris St. #A, Sebastapol, CA 95472).   Editorial information: Adrian Nye, adrian@ora.com.   - The X Journal is started bi-monthly publication September 1991 on a  variety of X topics. Subscription information: The X Journal, Subscriber  Services, Dept XXX, P.O. Box 3000, Denville, NJ 07834, USA. Editorial  information: editors%topgun@uunet.uu.net.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   9)  What are these common abbreviations/acronyms?   Xt: The X Toolkit Intrinsics is a library layered on Xlib which  provides the functionality from which the widget sets are built. An \\\"Xt-based\\\"  program is an application which uses one of those widget sets and which uses  Intrinsics mechanisms to manipulate the widgets.  Xmu: The Xmu library is a collection of Miscellaneous Utility functions useful in building various applications and widgets.  Xaw: The Athena Widget Set is the MIT-implemented sample widget set distributed with X11 source.  Xm: The OSF/Motif widget set from the Open Software Foundation; binary kits are available from many hardware vendors.  Xhp (Xw): The Hewlett-Packard Widget Set was originally based on R2++,  but several sets of patches exist which bring it up to R3, as it is distributed on the X11R4 tapes. Supplemental patches are available to use it with R4/R5.  CLX: The Common Lisp X Interface is a Common Lisp equivalent to Xlib.  XDMCP: The X Display Manager Protocol provides a uniform mechanism for  a display such as an X terminal to request login service from a remote host.  XLFD: The X Logical Font Description Conventions describes a standard logical font description and conventions to be used by clients so that they can query and access those resources.  RTFM: Common expert-speak meaning \\\"please locate and consult the  relevant documentation -- Read the Forgotten Manual\\\".  UTSL: A common expression meaning \\\"take advantage of the fact that you  aren't limited by a binary license -- Use The Source, Luke\\\".  API: Application-Programmer Interface. The function calls, etc., in a programming library.  BDF: Bitmap Distribution Format; a human-readable format for uncompiled X fonts.  GUI: graphical user interface.  UIL: the User Interface Language, part of OSF/Motif which lets  programmers specify a widget hierarchy in a simple \\\"outline\\\" form  WCL: the Widget Creation Language, a package which extends the  understanding of the Xt resource format such that a widget hierarchy and  actions on the widgets can be specified through the resources file  GIL: the file format put out by Sun's OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0  UIMS: User Interface Management System  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  10)  What is the ICCCM? (How do I write X-friendly applications?)   The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the  official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It  describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with  other clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need  to read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the  selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window  manager.  Get it either:  - as part of the R4 distribution from MIT  - in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys \\\"X Window System\\\" book  - as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, \\\"X Protocol Reference Manual.\\\" A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.  The version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to  the efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the  presentation.  [from David Rosenthal, 10/90]   - the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's \\\"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5\\\". The complete document is on the R5 tapes.   Alternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in \\\"RTFM\\\" and is the most-important of the least-read X documents.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?   The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of  cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software  interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.  MIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and  administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the  Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership,  Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).  Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail,  with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape, interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.   Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with  others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification is produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium as a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public  review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.  Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or  Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.  Write to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer  Science, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.  [For complete information see the XCONSORTIUM man page from the X11R4 distribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?   OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK was developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was developed by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF  members.    OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide;  there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications. Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the  one from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce  programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's  (formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a \\\"virtual toolkit\\\" which provides objects in the style of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.   OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising  their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.  [Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?   Open Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system  that combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface  specification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including the SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and a number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).  [thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?   DECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI  toolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a  session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar,  dxpsview, etc.).  (At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.) [8/90]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  15)  What is PEX?   PEX is the \\\"PHiGS Extension to X\\\".  PHiGS stands for \\\"Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics  System\\\" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation  and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in  hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension  allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized  hardware for 3D graphics.  Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely  redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample implementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release. Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for  their workstations and X terminals.  [last modified 10/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  16)  What is \\\"low-bandwidth X\\\" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?  There are several options for using X over serial lines:  SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP packets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years, and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations. Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really  ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per  packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully  so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links).   CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the  40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do  anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help, but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed  data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).  PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than SLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial  line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for  running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable.  XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition  to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes  redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and  using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a  pseudo-X server or \\\"proxy\\\" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There  are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:    (1) You don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't   otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly   connected), and    (2) It reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that  have to cross the serial interface, and    (3) In addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering   packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for   blocks to compress.  LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a standard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using  NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information  (e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps,  etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a  Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample  implementation available in R6.  Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/ in the following files:         XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote         XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX  [information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]   There is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk at the 7th MIT X Technical Conference.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?   The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the X window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is no single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways  for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout, decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order (generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):   wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3  uwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed,  although it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.  twm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window  managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a re-parenting window manager.   awm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers  cwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system.   rtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.  dxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering  hpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm  mwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit  tekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering   olwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style Guide functionality  olwm (AT&T): ditto  gwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in Lisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on avahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]  m_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape  pswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release  swm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple GUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes from the resources file  twm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked twm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape  vtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a single-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available on archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available  from export. [3/92]  tvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is available on archive servers  olvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is  available on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.  mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version is floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a  source license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].  NCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look   XDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals   ctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5  twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export. Version 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.  vuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.  4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM  piewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?   It needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your  window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X  session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your  window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in the background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:   exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action. Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window,  whether or not you kill or restart your window manager.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?   Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature -- which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the geometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something  close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are  looking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces.  Look for the application \\\"xplaces\\\" on an archive-server near you. There are  several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage. [10/90]  Some new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the  saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running applications and the resource database.  [Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?   DEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this,  add to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:  sm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?   You can turn auto-repeat on or off by using \\\"xset r on|off\\\". The X protocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is a capability not supported by all systems.  Some servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over  server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the  server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server  from MIT with the options \\\"-ar1 350 -ar2 30\\\" to reduce the sensitivity of the  keyboard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?   There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful  for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and  does not do \\\"macro expansion.\\\"  Some (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors,  accept a translation resource such as:  xterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\\\   <Key>F1: string(\\\"setenv DISPLAY unix:0\\\") which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control characters in the string, use \\\\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include.  Window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor has a special \\\"remapper\\\" client been made available.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  David B.

Nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation.  An  instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies.  According to  Nazi theoreticians, Gypsies were an Aryan race.  They were persecuted, and in huge numbers murdered, because most European Gypies were considered not pure Gypsies but \\\"mongrels\\\" formed from the pure Gypsy  race and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between  the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies, by the way.

It is not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL means that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable.   If your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI sales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a shot.   As one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in 1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates sped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5 years. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ('85-'89), the PI ('88-'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D's - '86-'90), the Power Series parallel systems ('88-'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics architectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every 18 months to 2 years.  These are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become almost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new platform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths, faster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we don't, we become uncompetitive.  From the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today.  You can't wait to buy, but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep for one in writing. If it's feasible, they should be able to do that. Some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as the Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge R4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.   If that's happening, it's becausing of misunderstandings or mis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our customer base.   Most SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule slipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments.   Five years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processor technologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at least 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is really 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.  There are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don't give up, we know it.

We are now mapping the human genome.  We will  ;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic ;engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want. ;No breeding, no \\\"hybrids\\\", etc.  The ethical question is, should ;we?   Two past problems with eugenics have been  1) reducing the gene pool and  2) defining the status of the eugenized.   Inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted genes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to crowd out \\\"garbage genes.\\\" This may in the future become possible. Even if it does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully mean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy later. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa and for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We don't really know what the future may hold for our environment. The reduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred domesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age, meteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc., etc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible available is a good strategy for species survival.    Of course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out as no different than anyone else's. But if we could make \\\"philosopher-kings\\\" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they) want to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their kings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually realized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while, it was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen to persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing new under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before \\\"1984.\\\"      I see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2 problems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to use any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That hasn't stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which have died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also many are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own power. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the fates of others, and have survived by making better choices when their turns came.   Not that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us off the face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global warming or whatever could and may still do that, too.    The real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don't think man has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any better than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we may not. If we don't, I hope there are reservoirs of \\\"garbage\\\" people out in some backwater with otherwise long discarded \\\"garbage\\\" genes which will pull us through.    I believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same. Man needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his lacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have, and I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God in their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue needed to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have died out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough input from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed themselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the ones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit to use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes thus far, or else haven't had enough power for long enough.    In summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new technology is really an ancient one. And the answer, in some ways hard, in some ways easy, is the same ancient answer. It isn't the power, it is the Spirit.   Sorry for the long post. Got carried away.\",\"Hi again,  Many thanks to all the people who responded to my request for a MS- Windows screen grabber.  It proves to me AGAIN that the net is a  wonderful thing.  :-)  So, in summary:  There are two choices:  1) Various screen grabber packages (Corel Draw has one, there are a couple on simtel and cica).  2) Use the built-in PrintScreen and Alt-PrintScreen functionality to paste the screen (or window) to the clipboard.  Then paste the  clipboard to your application.  Cool!  Again, thanks for the info...

Many of our monitors, as they age, develop shadows on white and bright colors. \",\" I don't think anyone is arguing that there would be no effect. But there would be no _net_ _positive_ effect. You also have to  consider the negative side: Law abiding citizens, armed with  fireamrs (pistols for the most part), prevent between 80,000 (National Crime Survey) and 1,000,000 (Dr. Kleck) crimes each year. (Those are the extremes. Most studies find the number to be 500,000 to 600,000.) About 1% of those crimes are homicides, so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately 5,000 lives each year. There are roughly 12,000 criminal homicides and fatal accidents involving guns each year. For there to  be any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measures would disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns. That would be very hard to do: According the the federal BATF, only 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Since gun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legal sales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed, law-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on armed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.)  That doesn't sound like a net benefit to me.     Since most were with licensed weapons, I assume you are not supporting \\\"reasonable\\\" laws (i.e. waiting periods, background checks, licenses, etc...). Since only a complete ban would  alter the statistic you refer to, I assume that's what you are supporting.  By the way, 1135 people dies in 1986 from falling down stairs. 250 accidental handgun deaths isn't significant next to  other household accidents.   1080 children under the age of 10 died by drowning, 69 from  drinking poisonous household chemicals (like Drano), 139 from falls. If the real goal is to reduce the tragic, accidental deaths of children, wouldn't a ban on drain cleaners be a  better palce to start? (Or, perhaps, restricting ownership to professionals like plumbers?)   While you might call it \\\"emphasis\\\", refering to completely two statistics in the same sentence _implies_ a comparison. If it isn't valid, and you put the numbers together to convince people you are right, the kindest thing I could call it is propaganda.\",\"(quoting someone else here)            Yeah!   The algorithm is classified because a military contract (or similar government equivalent to military) has been let for this \\\"proprietary\\\" design that the Feds say that NSA developed.  Is there a patent?  Is that patent publicly available?  My betting is that that too is classified.   If the algorithm were made public, or reverse-engineered, it would compromise not only the goal of Justice of being able to read every chip users cypto-data but would reduce profits for the selected chip maker.   Wouldn't that just be too bad? \",\"Well, I'm back from Tokyo, so here are the standings after the April 13 update.   - Andrew  USENET Hockey Draft Standings Week 27  Posn Team    Pts Proj Cash Last Posn  1.

EX:  I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM, an external video card (so I don't rob my SIMM's), and the default Apple cache card (I believe this is 32K?).  Say I have my cache set at 2 MEG, what good does a measly 32K do me on the cache card?  Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache between the card and the SIMM's?  Or does it still speed things up by providing a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly into the SIMM RAM cache?  I'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to really do any good compared to what you can set yourself.  Yet, Daystar FastCache has numbers which show around a 30% performance boost on some operations.  Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMM accesses?  Please help, I'm trying to find the optimum memory settings for the IIci system described in the EX above.\",\" I've seen a film of it, my memory may be faulty, but as I remember it the vehicle was slightly over a meter long, with a thick baseplate 30-40 cm in diameter. I think the narrative said it was propelled by dynamite sticks. There were four detonations within about 2 s, the second coming after about 2 m of flight in. Max altitude seemed to be on the order of 50 m, but that is hard  to judge.\",\"My brother has been alienated from my parents and me since shortly after his marriage to a domineering and insecure woman, about twelve years ago. We've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level for most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined slights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'll happen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I've seen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep the next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact with us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his choice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.    From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a relationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful relationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, \\\"Why be dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse to get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to come back.\\\" It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on with the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I could think of.    Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and raved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and in which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was beyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the allowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not quietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their relationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung up. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is the first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if she's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have the break out in the open and done with.       I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself; angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for persisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their children; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us that he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to appease an unappeasable, emotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess; scared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will change and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self- righteous over this bit of proof that they can't \\\"get away\\\" with treating us or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even beginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad, sad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in a horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--or they can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustrated because I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me up the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence, and vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am not free of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO* something, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besetting vices; I'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal mental chatter enough to listen for God.)   Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? Is this a time to reach out to my brother? To let things be? How can I conquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him?   Here's the big question I've been evading throughout this long, long post: Is it ok, as a Christian and a proponent of faith, hope, and charity, to accept the destruction of a relationship? To give up on my own brother, or at least to accept that I am powerless to help him and can only wait and see what happens? Do please answer--by e-mail or post.

If you are uninterested, since I will have the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can kill them.  I will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course, are subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as possible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks and/or did not play for another NHL team this season.  Thus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...  #1 BRIAN HAYWARD  Season: 11th Acquired: '91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  P (D)  It is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that featured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and '89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing grade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this year, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would not be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.  But Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first ever victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames. As he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.  #30 JEFF HACKETT  Season: 3rd Acquired: '91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft Grade:  C  Hackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply wasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles, almost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save percentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to bench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry the team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early injury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor, but upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next year.  #31 WADE FLAHERTY  Season: 1st (still eligible as rookie) Acquired: '91-92, signed as undrafted free agent Grade:  I (A-)  It is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the incomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary Flames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started the season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades' owner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP honors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he tries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs Irbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up all-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can share the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor Robins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he may not ever.  #32 ARTURS IRBE  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  B+  I may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that he's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has provided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting the team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26. He has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and making passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the goonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do with such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for a playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named as a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.\",\" Of course, the list has to agree with the nickname laws laid down by the GIPU almost 2000 years ago (you know... the 9 of them that were written on the iron tablets that melted once and had to be reinscribed?).

[FARID] To count on Iranian help to supposedly counter Turkish influence will  [FARID] be a fatal error on the part of Armenia as long as Armenia in  [FARID] violation of international law has Azerbaijani lands in occupation.   Armenia is not counting on Iranian help. As far as violations of international laws, which international law gives Azerbaijan the right to attack and  depopulate the Armenians in Karabakh?  [FARID] If Armenian aggression continues in the territory of Azerbaijan, not  [FARID] only there won't be any aid from Iran to Armenia but also steps will  [FARID] be taken to have Armenian army back in Armenia.   And who do you speak for? Rafsanjani?  [FARID] The Azerbaijanis of Iran will be the guarantors of this policy.

Well, Farid, your supposed experts are not expert! The Russians have had non-stop influence in the Caucasus since the Treaty of Turkmanchay in 1828. Hmm... that makes it 1993-1828 = 165 years!   Oh, I see the Azeris from Iran are going to force out the Armenians from  Karabakh! That will be a real good trick!   [FARID] Iran is not alian to developing the capability to produce the A bomb  [FARID] and a reliable delivery system (refer to recent news releases  [FARID] regarding the potential of Iran).   So the Azeris from Iran are going to force the Armenians from Karabakh by forcing the Iranian government to drop an atomic bomb on these Armenians.  [FARID] The moral of the story is that, you don't go invading your neighbor's  [FARID] home (Azerbaijan) and flash Russia's guns when questioned about it.   Oh, but it's just fine if you drop an atomic bomb on your neighbor! You are a damn fool, Farid!  [FARID] (Marshal Shapashnikov may have to eat his words regarding Turkey in a  [FARID] few short years!).   So you are going to drop an atomic bomb on Russia as well.   [FARID] Peaceful resolution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is the only  [FARID] way to go. Armenia may soon find the fruits of Aggression very bitter  [FARID] indeed.

These areas control the release of gonadotropin, which controls the release and flux of steroids governing development, especially sexual development.

I've never seen one that specifically provides the info that Davis insists that he has, so I'd love to have a cite.   Wrong.  There's one gun design where that can happen, and it is supposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber. (Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under the hammer.  In other words, it can be usefully carried in a safe manner.)  Other handgun designs don't have that property; if their trigger isn't pulled, the hammer can't hit the firing pin.   The breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them I can safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a large negative number of people are killed by animals, because we know that the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the number of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the described circumstance) is near zero.

This was two weeks to the DAY from when I called the order in.      Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the  peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway  documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals. The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office) was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and  has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a  lot to do with it.      It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications.  I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then \\\"maps\\\" the other machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can \\\"cd\\\" to these drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine. It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the  peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive.     My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430 credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!    So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it was me.

They say the 39-year-old mechanic committed suicide after     killing his wife, Jocelyne Parent, 31.       The couple had been separated for a month and the woman had     gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money     for food. A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked     his wife with a kitchen knife, cutting her throat, police said.       She was only the latest of 13 women slain by a husband or     lover in Quebec in the last five weeks.       Five children have also been slain as a result of the same     domestic \\\"battles.\\\"       Last year in Quebec alone, 29 [women] were slain by their     husbands.

By far the (still) best method to diagnose a hernia is old fashioned physical examination. If you have an obvious hernia sac coming down  into your scrotum, or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by increasing intra-abdominal pressure.... Sometimes is not that obvious. The hernia is small and you can only  detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal.  Whether you have a recurrent hernia, or this is related to the previous operation, I can't tell you. The person that examined you is in  the best position to make that determination.  Are there non-invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia?

Of cause, the R4-version  did not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass    instead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition    (formerly XtTblPosition).  Since compiling with R5, the program causes a zero width or height error  (on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the  model_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText   widgets) exist, XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of    zero.   Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the    width and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup   or XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on    whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource    file or not).    Question: Does anyone know, why XtQueryGeometry returns so low prefered    values when working on table widgets or perhaps what    to do about?   I'll be happy, if someone is able to help me.

I would first like to thank each and every person who sent me a response (be it a positive or negative one). I read EVERY letter and thought about  each one!!   I got all sorts of responses, from \\\"marry her\\\" to \\\"have nothing ever to  do with her again\\\"  Through reading the Bible and through a lot of prayer, here is what I have decided to do.  I sent her a letter today. First, i told her that if she was really serious about moving away from home to another state that \\\"I would do anything to  get you here in NC.\\\" I told her that I tried to find out if there were  any new stores planning to be built---but they wouldn't tell me.  About her marraige comment (I'm not gonna call it a proposal, cause I still don't know if it was a total joke or not) I more or less said that \\\"Marry me?? Well, get transferred to NC first and then we'll talk :) :)\\\"  Hopefully, what i said could be interpreted either way.  Needless to say, there has been a lot of praying over this...I  have done a lot of reading about marraige from the Bible. If she was dead serious about getting married---I wouldn't do it yet simply b/c she is not (as far as I know to this point) a Christian. It just wouldn't work w/o God in the marraige as well. I figure that if God wanrs this to go through--he's kept us in touch for 10  years now---he can handle one more. If God wants it to happen, it will happen!  She will be in NC in June meetinf some relatives so I'll get to  see her...and I'll get a letter from her befoe then so I know more of what to look forward to.  I guess all I can do now is wait and pray. I have decided not to tell my folks until I'm totally sure what is going on.  I do ask that everyone that wrote me to please keep this situation in your prayers..  Finally, I would like to thank EVERYONE who wrote in...

Don't both halfs of the key have to come together (in some form) at the time the chip is constructed?  Or is it built like a fusable prom, with the chip being sent to the 1st escrow agency to program its 1/2 key, then the 2nd agency to program its 1/2 key (but who invents the safeguards that prevent the 2nd agency from reading the information already programmed by the 1st)?

This is not hell, this is permanent death. It is indeed what atheists (generally) expect and it is neither fair nor unfair, it just is. You might as well argue about whether being made mostly of carbon and water is \\\"fair\\\".  However, the atheists who claim that Hell is unfair are talking about the fire and brimstone place of endless suffering, which necessarily includes eternal existance (life, I dunno, but some sort of continuation); not at all the same thing.  Granted, you clearly feel that hell=death, but this is not a univeral sentiment as near as I can tell.  If *your* idea of God \\\"condemns\\\" heathens to ordinary death, I have no problem with that.

Is it distressing Brendan?  The point is that any eugenic solution to the Jewish Problem as Elias has proposed smacks of pure Nazism.  The fact that Elias' proposal cast the entire \\\"problem\\\" as one of the abnormal presence of Israeli society in the Middle East, and that he buried a slam against U.S. aid to Israel in the midst of his \\\"even-handed\\\" solution of the Jewish Question, made it obvious what  he had in mind: disolving the Jewish polity.  That *is* a Nazi doctrine: rectification of the \\\"abnormal presence\\\" of the Jewish people within a  larger body politic.  Whether your \\\"solution\\\" involves gas, monetary  incentives to the poor Jews to marry out, or as Feisal Husseini has  said, \\\"disolve the Zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal  surrounding Arab culture,\\\" you are engaged in a Nazi project.

Wirewrap gets into trouble at much higher frequencies than any TTL can handle.  The 'increase' of wiring capacitance is not really relevant (you have to use transmission line techniques, and the capacitance is no problem).     Hand-powered is a terrible choice (IMHO) unless you are a field maintenance person who will do maybe a dozen connections at a time.  Your hands will cramp.  Battery-powered wire-wrap guns are available in the $150 range, and so are the little twiddle-stick manual types ($15).

This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line looks better on low resolution devices.  The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent.  They also give an example of how to \\\"emulate\\\" strokeadjust in PostScript environments where it is absent.  The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints of a line using the following formula for each coordinate:   new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25   Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in \\\".25\\\".  From reading I thought that what they might actually do is:   new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25   This results in all the coordinates ending in either \\\"0.25\\\" or \\\"0.75\\\"  whichever is closer.

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here? * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt? * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?   * What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?    Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always   make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.   You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same   newsgroup. After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the   readers want to see.  * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?    No. In fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were   created exactly so that political questions like ``Should RSA be   patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. Many   sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,   comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of   people who don't care about those other topics, try to put your   postings in the right group.    Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic   ``spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either.  * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?    ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here's some   ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a   doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.    If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some   ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by   random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the   opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is   distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some   systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts   and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but   this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most   sci.crypt readers won't bother with.    So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,   find out if it's really new. Look through this FAQ for references and   related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the   introductory textbooks.    When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at   large, try to break it yourself! You shouldn't waste the time of tens   of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily   answered on your own.    If you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some   reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your   system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to   sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated   in some areas.)    If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.   You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted   cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break   Snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. If you don't have enough   experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will   be able to find a flaw. If this happens, it's your responsibility to   consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more   layer of complication and come back for another round.    A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA   look at it. A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope   of this FAQ.\",\"      As I recall, the Penguins and Devils tied for third place last year with identical records, as well.

These are folks who    believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only    Jesus, rather than Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  This may have    doctrinal implications, but as far as I know it does not mean that    these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father.  I'm not the    right one to describe this theology, and in fact I think there may be    several, including what would classically be called monophysite or    Arian (two rather different views), as well as some who have beliefs    that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards, but who won't    use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply    because it is not Biblical.  --clh]  Not Biblical?  What then can they make of the end of Matthew?  (28:18)And Jesus came and said to them, \\\"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. (19)Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, (20) and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded to you.  And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.\\\" {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]  The notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other texts contradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the Trinity the most likely explanation after all?  But maybe I simply misunderstand their views.  (Is anyone else out there forced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged dictionary??  Christianity really is an education in itself.)  -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian language as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things like \\\"one essense and three persons\\\".  Obviously the three-fold baptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the term \\\"three-fold\\\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly consistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose full formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent's.  It's unlikely that Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine. Indeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do not believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae occurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in the name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as well.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in Mat. to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.  \\\"Jesus only\\\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this consistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I'm not the right one to ask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not appear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of dealing with the idiomatic phrase \\\"in the name of\\\".)  Those who use the three-fold formula don't seem to have a standard answer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus. I suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \\\"in the name of\\\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name of Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus' authority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism with the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there's a certain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we could just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn't require the specific three-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes baptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  One might well suspect that in the early church, more than one baptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to be the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great damage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that I think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of the few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize mutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in the interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that those groups that actually use \\\"in the name of Jesus\\\" now do seem to have in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I've said before, I'm not the one to explain what their doctrine is.\",\" Newsgroups: rec.audio,misc.forsale Distribution: na Subject: Forsale: Sony D-22 diskman \",\"To Mr. Millitello -   Listen, Sammy, can you explain why Buck pitched you in relief yesterday?

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the newsgroups.  Many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles:     1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers    2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism    3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)    4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument    5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources  This is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The others are entirely optional.  If you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup news.announce.newusers.  The articles titled \\\"A Primer on How to Work With the Usenet Community\\\", \\\"Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet\\\" and \\\"Hints on writing style for Usenet\\\" are particularly relevant.  Questions concerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.  If you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the \\\"Finding Stuff\\\" section below.

These articles are free.  Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute them to anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to the author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network.                                   Finding Stuff  All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are some suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:  1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with    \\\"Alt.Atheism FAQ:\\\".  2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.     If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up    correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the    problem.  3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].    Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest    versions of the FAQ files there.     FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you    need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with        send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq     in the body.  4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article    \\\"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\\\" carries a list of these    sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.  5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu    consisting of the following lines:        send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources       send usenet/alt.atheism/faq       send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction       send usenet/alt.atheism/logic       send usenet/alt.atheism/resources  5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of    the following lines:        send atheism/faq/faq.txt       send atheism/faq/logic.txt       send atheism/faq/intro.txt       send atheism/faq/resource.txt     and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.    There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are \\\"help\\\" and    \\\"send atheism/index\\\".  6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the    newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this    if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to    clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.    it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,    people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have     FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files. \",\" : >DUCATI3.UUE : >QUUNCD Ver. 1.4, by Theodore A.

Deputy Prime Minister Erdal Inonu told reporters in Ankara that Turkey was responding positively to a request from Azerbaijan for assistance.  \\\"We are giving a positive response to all requests\\\" from Azerbaijan, \\\"within the limits of our capabilities,\\\" he said.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Vural Valkan declined to elaborate on the nature of the aid being sent to Azerbaijan, but said they were within the framework  of the Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  Hurriyet, published in Istanbul, said Turkey was sending light weapons to Azerbaijan, including rockets, rocket launchers and ammunition.  Ankara began sending the hardware after a visit to Turkey last week by a high-ranking Azerbaijani official. Turkey has however ruled out, for the second time in one week, that it would intervene militarily in Azerbaijan.  Wednesday, Inonu told reporters Ankara would not allow Azerbaijan to suffer defeat at the hands of the Armenians. \\\"We feel ourselves bound to help Azerbaijan, but I am not in a position right now to tell you what form (that) help may take in the future,\\\" he said.  He said Turkish aid to Azerbaijan was continuing, \\\"and the whole world knows about it.\\\"  Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel reiterated that Turkey would not get militarily involved in the conflict. Foreign policy decisions could not be  based on street-level excitement, he said.  There was no immediate reaction in Ankara to regional reports, based on Armenian sources in Yerevan, saying Turkish pilots and other officers were captured when they were shot down flying Azerbaijani warplanes and  helicopters.  The newspaper Cumhuriyet said Turkish troops were digging in along the border with Armenia, but military sources denied reports based on claims by local people that gunfire was heard along the border. No military action has  occurred, the sources said.  The latest upsurge in fighting between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis flared early this month when Armenian forces seized the town of Kelbajar and later positioned themselves outside Fizuli, near the Iranian border.  \",\"[reply to keith@actrix.gen.nz (Keith Stewart)]     It would help if you (and anyone else asking for medical information on some subject) could ask specific questions, as no one is likely to type in a textbook chapter covering all aspects of the subject.

It's in the hands of cops, and while I am sure most of the time they are good, their security will not be as good as the escrow houses.

But that's OK, I understand you have a hockey background. Stats like \\\"plus/minus\\\" make RBI look good.   OK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to which I'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please answer yes or no, Roger:  Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs? AL only, please.  For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact that a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the team scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite, hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a rule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs, for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game. So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that they scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other things being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack Morris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238 for Boston), the \\\"Red Jays\\\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or enough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola pitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in (particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs his team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this analysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but that is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and evaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that \\\"had Morris performed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\\\"   This is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.

The same writer also objects to the Bible for teaching that   > \\\"woman was created after man, to be his helper\\\" etc.  This is presumably a reference to Genesis 2.

The statement that woman is not capable of functioning by herself, that she needs a man to open doors for her, would have been seen as a particularly gratuitous insult. The fact that the creation of woman from the dust of the ground was given only briefly and in general, while the creation of the Man was given in six times the number of words, would have been cited as evidence of the author's estimate of the relative importance of the sexes.

No experimental result should be accepted unless it is described in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications do indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be accepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and reasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.  But people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy reasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a large part of the history of science.  There are a couple of negative points to make here:  1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct verification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted part of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What would be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical reality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could lie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of experimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.  (I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though. I don't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less a theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it is hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather directly verifying the existence of qi.)  2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational experiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and interpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical controversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall, there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations, petty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which computations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical function of science: results don't count unless they can be replicated.  The whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate part can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.  Pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals; but even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed; that when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate polarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was indistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur's irrational motivation had led to a replicable, and important, result.  This is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not even produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.

That's because these \\\"peer-reviewed\\\" studies are not addressing the effects of MSG in people, they're looking at animal models. You can't walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects demonstrated in humans.  Note that I wouldn't have any argument with a statement like \\\"noting that animal administration has pro- duced the following [blah, blah], we must be careful about its use in humans.\\\"  This is precisely NOT what you said.   It most certainly is for neurotoxicology.  You know, studies of glutamate involve more than \\\"food science\\\".   So, point us to the studies in humans, please.  I'm familiar with the literature, and I've never seen any which relate at all to Olney's work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons.   Well, actually, they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine; it's a essential amino acid.  They just try to get as little as is healthy without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the blood.

It's just that this \\\"projected safety margin\\\" is a construct derived from animal models and given that, you can \\\"prove\\\" anything you like.  We're talking prudent policy in infant nutrition here, yet you're misrepresenting it as received wisdom.   You mean \\\"asserting\\\".  You're being intellectually dishonest (or just plain confused), because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other.  Olney's reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants, but that's not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods, nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects (for obvious reasons.)

Questions to Israelis   To:  shaig@Think.COM  Subject: Ten questions to Israelis  Dear Shai,  Your answers to my questions are unsatisfactory.  In the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence of Israeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information I have received from other quarters, according to which there are two distinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship (Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passports etc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all times and present them at many public places, almost every day. These ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab. You maintain that this mainly because of religious services provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ? Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it serves no other purpose ?  In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was established, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).  Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public official. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to Vanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.  Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning 'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from Ma'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?  You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been used by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet Union into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they would not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be very happy if you could convince me that what I am told about Israel were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so. I suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.\",\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Symbiotics: Zionism-Antisemitism   Zionism and the Holocaust -------------------------- by Haim Bresheeth  The first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history of the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without anti-semitism is impossible. Zionism agrees with the basic tenet of anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.  The history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While the industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942, its roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles in Europe. When the hopes for liberation through bourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for improving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.  The socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had to contend with opposition from a new and small, almost insignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these two offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe. While the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of Europe's workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme aimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a Jewish state.  Historically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of forces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option tree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become barred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point before that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an option was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority position until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist Federation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny minority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to represent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an interantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was the only international organisation allowed to operate during this period. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist Federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that surprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political power, power based not on representation, but from being selected as the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish problem'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in Germany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in Germany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to be considered by German Jews.  The best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934. Immediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German goods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott. It was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull out, the campaign would collapse.  This problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi party as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement that existed between the two organisations on the question of race, nation, and the nature of the 'Jewish problem', and it offered to collaborate with the new regime:  \\\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of Jews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda - such as is currently being carried out against Germany in many ways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do battle but to convince and build.\\\"  In their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott. The main public act was the signature of the \\\"Transfer Agreement\\\" with the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In essence, the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out of the country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility for Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This right was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The Zionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial organisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts - 'helping' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the boycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine, and last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After all, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the Jews come and agree with them.  After news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the Zionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with the Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ? This was not the first time that the interests of both movements were presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von Mildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS, later followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine. This he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader, Kurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a series of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new Jew' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.  This little-known episode established quite clearly the relationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new regime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a number of key instances, even after the nature of the Final Solution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of reports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book concentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the Holocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the Holocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.  In the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen's play PERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end of the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and the African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a number of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A second front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies prepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann, the master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in occupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in April 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish leadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by Kastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their relationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did this is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its three and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly different from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian Jews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class was mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed freedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in fronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were Hungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be exterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in Hungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other countries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and were unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.  Like elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the ear of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this case the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members. Without their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men, plus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and controlled a million Jews, when they did not even know their whereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions. Eichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner's committee, that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them clearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain conditions were met.  The Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary about their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape, being in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the Nazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not have been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite plausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership. Thus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their death, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to work camps.  To be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of destruction: the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised to Kastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it was a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million Jews.  There was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be located, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of Kastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews here and there, but the scale of the operation would have been miniscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.  It is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration, like say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his strongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical outcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to the Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi and Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to disrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere, did Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those Jews.\",\" OK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.  We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is, is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of us who have bikes are familiar.  Let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its own, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to get rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches to transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to remain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike, through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the same way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along  a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change  surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact  patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It  probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice,  but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like  because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a  better way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch forces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface. You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it was the rotation that did it.  Looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple. Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them about the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels. How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not sideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski or skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels. I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like that, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect. Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try one of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very much like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn. So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's, a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have countersteering.  Conclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have motorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what real effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations of how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm  willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering.   If you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's behaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.\",\"FYI...I just posted this on alt.psychoactives as a response to what the group is for......   A note to the users of alt.psychoactives....

I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we   agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.   When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could   get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he   started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had   miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed   another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was   their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then   brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I   reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be   treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole   deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,   snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by   the turn of events.  Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting   to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and   asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him   that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,   that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs   and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still   pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to   lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told   him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.  A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all   apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus   knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about   it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,   and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....  I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we   decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him   back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the   truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the   incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of   there in my new truck in about 30 mins.  So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not   have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales   person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I   sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their   mistake.  Anyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred   dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.   I'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.\",\" [... stuff deleted ...]  I have to agree here.

You've got a point, though.  There are some who don't want to turn over everything and be a disciple, some have no clue about it because they've not been taught, some have done exactly that and turned over everything to follow Jesus, some are blocked by difficult doctrine taught by uncaring Pharisees and teachers of the law. However, Jesus pointed out what it takes to follow him and to be his disciple in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33.  My question is:  why do people ignore the command and treat it as optional?

It is its own OS, with (Billy Gates assures us) true  multi-tasking/multithreading, meets DOD security specs, will run win3.1  programs as well as DOS programs, has multi-processor support, and is primarily a Server program.  It's overhead is too high for it to be economical for most users.  Speaking of overhead, it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM.   It iwll run with 12, but that's like running OS/2 2.0 with 4 megs.  And that's  just to run it.  Also, I have heard that the system files take up 30-50 Megs,  and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig!  The SKD is distributed  on CD-ROM.  Chicogo is what I want to use.  It is, like NT, a true OS with thrue  multitasking and multithreading, but has much smaller hardware requirements,  and does not meet DOD security specs (but that's okay since it will probably  be more of a client OS).  there are a few otehr differences, but those are the  main ones.  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August.  The Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro$oft are in intense  competition, so it is said.  However, I think a different relationship will  arise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology), Chicogo will be the  client machine.  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together,  partly because Chicogo is just a small NT (think of it that way, anyway).   (Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS, so don't scorn the concept.)  Anyway, don't expect it soon.  Windows 4 and DOS 7 are supposed to be  released next year (read: see it in 95), so I expect that Chicogo won't be out  til '96.

These verses do not show that God's love is qualified but rather that He  is opposed to evil.

Frankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of the original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the writings of the era. This  is most refreshing.  Second, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days. My brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend to several matters pertaining to the State Militia.  Some people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro- nism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swiss would agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, both organized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State, Mississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar to one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocks of both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary but are probably similar.  Title 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as \\\"all able-bodied citizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty- two (62) years...\\\". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National Guard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The National Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective. It tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion of this \\\"para-constitutional\\\" arrangement is quite interesting in itself but somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at this date, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing as anything but a Federal reserve force.  Mississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organized Militia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other  States it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as a cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and senior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill on a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once a quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our State-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an organization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will come from the unorganized Militia.  In time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can order the activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will first be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either its contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the event that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law provides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the unorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by law, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militia of Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the State does not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such a force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use of mostly the private arms of the Militiamen.   It is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being the long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.   Regarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the sole representative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will have chosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist end of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, can be chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that the idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia or \\\"train bands\\\" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern- ment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to provide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years, and iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever, \\\"terrible and irresistible\\\".  These protections included: State control, not Federal; limitation of Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and Bear Arms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington. These limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern- ment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.  The National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the  Constitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting wars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The Constitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by the Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the War of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United States territory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutional authorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal Military and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until WW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer. When the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new member also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were \\\"grandfathered\\\". At least one of these \\\"grandfathered\\\" individuals refused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the Federal Courts.  Mr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to members of a \\\"well organized\\\" militia. However, the pre-Constitutional history of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when The Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton's definition of \\\"well organized\\\". In the period of peace between the French & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped drilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution. Perhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors who answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because their units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not be so bold.  Again, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, is not the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton nor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government and many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing of their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their responsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the Constitution.   Misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one error that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The Constitution prohibits States from keeping \\\"Troops or Ships of War in time of Peace\\\". I have heard some insist this prevents States from maintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do not understand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage. Today we call any large vessel a \\\"ship\\\" but in the 18th century the word described a particular kind of vessel.  A \\\"ship\\\" is a large vessel with three or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A \\\"brig\\\" has two masts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping the largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today's equivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles. \\\"Troops\\\" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization. Any study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out.   In at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being personally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia as a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequently both bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on their place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or scarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State's Militia.\",\"Dave Winfield's name does not go           In terms of PEAK, and I repeat PEAK years, Winfield has Done it   all. He has batted in the 340's for a season, drove in 100 and more runs   many times in a row before his injury. Consistently hit at or near 300   while knocking in 35 home runs. Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfield's   slugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. I still think that   dave was one of the BETTER of all time, but obviously not the best. He was   one of the best athletes evr to play baseball. He hit line drives that hit   the scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new   Stadium. Heck, only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence   since it has been remodeled. He could field, had a bullet arm, and his   hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields, and barry bonds   of last season. He is older now, and slowing down, takes more of an   uppercut to lift the ball out of the park, but he will always be my hero,   and my idol. There is nothing that could make me happier than George   inviting Dave back to the Bronx to play his last year of ball with the   Yankees. Of course, he will most likely refuse the offer, but who knows?   For 3 million dollars, he'll play. Heck they are giving gallego 2.5   million this year, having Dave as their DH, while leaving him time to play   the field when Tartabull is injured, or Nokes and mass are traded, should   give the Yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age   of Yankee domination. \",\" Hi Adda,  Most Bible scholars agree that there was one copy of each book at a certain time -- the time when the author wrote it.  Unfortunately, like all works from this time period and earlier, all that exists today are copies.    There are parts of books, scraps really, that date from around the mid second century (A.D. 130+).  There are some complete books, letters, etc. from the middle third century.  The first complete collection of the New Testament dates from the early 4th century (A.D. 325).  Throughout this period are writings of various early church fathers/leaders who quoted various scriptures in their writings.   If you mean that someone discovered thousands of \\\"Bibles\\\" which were all perfect copies dating from the last part of the 1st century...No!  If you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts (within the dates given above, but not letter perfect) and that the most probable text can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest original autographs (now lost) probably were written starting sometime shortly after A.D. 50, then yes.   From the original authors.  We call them Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Peter, Paul, James, and one other not identified.   As long as you make it.

Thus I've never really believed in God and heaven, although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either - I'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess.         Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how religious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though I want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof - just as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can't definitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by religious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.          Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is correct?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian God exists and the Gods of other religions don't?? How do you feel about people who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me - agnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their beliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isn't there contradiction between the religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do you have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they follow a different religion than you would if they were Christian??          Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in the bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??          I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are fairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and 'Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. The only part I find hard is the actual belief in God.          Finally, what is God's attitude to people like me, who don't quite believe in Him, but are generally fairly 'good' people. Surely not believing doesn't make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering why I so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.          Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they came into my head. I'm sure I probably repeated myself a bit too.

My  understanding is that the \\\"optional fpu\\\" refers to your option of purchasing the Centris 650 4/80 without FPU OR one of the other configurations WITH FPU.  Apple does not offer an upgrade from the non-FPU system to become an FPU system.  And, it is unclear whether the '040 processor on the non-FPU system (a 68LC040) can be replaced with a 68RC040 supplied by another vendor. Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris 610, which ONLY comes with a non-FPU 68LC040 processor CANNOT be upgraded to support an FPU - the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot swap one for another (again, according to Apple's memo).

My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the bottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the 46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have large, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get them :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the waist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece size that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's problems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and when I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).  I can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are in some way different from us real folks.  Also, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands. I've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a store wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom in any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my sidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally leave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall down unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight), stuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit), and run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be running errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...  As far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably equal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by 3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around the waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.  So I'd have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit, I still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I own.  Wouldn't go long distance without it.

A: No, no, no!  We do not recognize the State of Israel.  We said    \\\"recognition\\\" -- when a Palestinian state is established.  It will then    decide if to recognize Israel or not.  When it is established, its    parliament will convene and decide.    And replace them with what?  If Israel is to withdraw its control of any territory, there must be two prerequsites.  One is that it leads to a reduction in deaths.  The second is that it should not weaken Israels bargianing position with respect to peace talks.   Leaving Gaza unilateraly is a bad idea because it encourages arabs to think they can get what they want by killing Jews.  The only way Israel should pull out of Gaza is at the end of negotiations. These negotiations should lead to a mutually agreeable solution with security guarantees for both sides.   Until arabs are ready to sit down at the table and talk again, they should not expect, or recieve more concessions.

Since they aren't fixed in position on their stainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different position. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of contact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the ball, not the center cylindrical area.  I've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but needs to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our office's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one could still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might help.  I would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If you can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl  alcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free.  If you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see if it is actually causing the axle to spin.   If all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-( It could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be necessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that dirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction.

Some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they  were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for \\\"numbers\\\" (though  secretly afraid of them). Others steered clear of such puzzle books because  they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern  mathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't  know how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were  no exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a  specialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \\\"I willingly confess that  any time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was a hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of  my friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route --constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid  using algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it's a fact that is  well known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates,  nor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers (nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It  seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade  teachers.\\\"  Now, I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the  bookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to  recommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most  fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a  relatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to Venus and back.

Naive and wise at the same time, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these  problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian  architecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is  now Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant  letters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of  Komitas, or the paintings of Saryan.  An edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a  bibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions of Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh  Century (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).  The abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way  of life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and  worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years  the book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in  Armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just anyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk  Father Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has  brought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the  general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable  problem book.    Vardapet Anania of Shirak   Once fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no   philosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering   it the mother of all wisdom.      --Anania of Shirak  Among ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because  of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his  work. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and Solutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation of scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and Armenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last work was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia,  Movses of Khoren).  In his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:   I, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our  Armenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately,   in the expression of the psalmist, \\\"every day I illuminated the   eyes of my mind.\\\" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,  I came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy,   the mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia   neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the   sciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man   named Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me  that in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,  Christosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But          soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but          only of certain fragmentary facts.   I then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me:   \\\"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the   coast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full   of wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature.\\\" I asked   them how they knew this. They answered: \\\"We saw ourselves that many   people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man.   Indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,  Philagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become   pupils of Tyukhik.\\\" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to   God, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.   I went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I   He sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St.   Gregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself   lived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there.\\\"   Vardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with   me. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated   the science of number, and with such success that my fellow students  at the king's court began to envy me.   I spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not   been translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable   collection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan,   books on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why   enumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did   not have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating  that when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into   Armenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the   translation read as if the work were written in that language   originally.   Tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had   learned the Armenian language. \\\"When I was young,\\\" he said, \\\"I lived   in Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and   for a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I   served as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and   literature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was   wounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to   the Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: \\\"If You prolong my life,   I shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to   collecting treasures of knowledge.\\\" And the Lord heard my prayers.   After I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria   and Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher   from Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned   to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\\\"   After some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for   him, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to   assume the teacher's position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to   God not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because  of his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study   with him.   And I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from   him this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our   country, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God's   help, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me   for my efforts.      Problems and Solutions   A half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed  on verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper;   one forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and   forty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many   copies were printed in all.      --Imitation of Anania of Shirak  A Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\\\"books have their own fate\\\"). The fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The manuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because, according to  Armenian historians, \\\"in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded  from invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children.\\\" Biding their time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of  ancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts). And its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two  manuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction  and commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited,  annotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a  member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).  In the translator's words, the problems of Anania are \\\"amusing, full of life,  and simple.\\\" Orbeli goes on to say: \\\"The subjects of the problems are  generally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland  Shirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are  named, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a  contemporary of Anania.\\\" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used  only \\\"aliquots\\\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is necessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to  represent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).  Like any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the  retelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their  full glory. So let's open Anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages.  Problems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D.  572.  Problem 1  My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the  Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary  heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops.  The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time,  pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third  time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were  still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from  this remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.  Problem 8  During the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak Kamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the Persian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a  day. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent  riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in  a day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.  Problem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian  translation, they are all called \\\"dishes.\\\" But in the original Armenian,  according to Orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are  called mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian  word, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before  Anania's Problems and Solutions.  Problem 18  There was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the  metal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from one fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten  drams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.  Several of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in  Anania's time -- for instance, problem 7.  Problem 7  Once I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank  of the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast.  We caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped out of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found  forty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.  The temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I'll restrain myself and offer you just one more.  Problem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that  inhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no mention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according  to the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of  Shirak offers evidence to the contrary .  Problem 20  The hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik,  was at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild donkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and,  running to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with his brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild  beasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by  arrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were  caught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And  so, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.    \\\"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli\\\"   His biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a   bibliography.     -- K Uzbashyan, Academician      Iosef Abgarovich Orbeli  Anyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the  solution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation  of Anania of Shirak's Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages, has probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders,  and the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great  attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for  a degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma  attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An  advertisement at the end of the book reads: \\\"This book was typeset in  December 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by  me, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with  borders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project  to the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.\\\"  Typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned  orientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage  Museum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had  already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis  Academiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its  rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish  the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian  churches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve  the unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G. Strolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the  blockade of Leningrad in World War II.)  When Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times  were hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania was for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the  printer's craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the  Academy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion of Russian academic typography.     Back to Earth   This book by definition does not exhaust all the most important   works in this domain. The editor hopes that those who are guilty   of this incompleteness will read these lines and, stung by shame,   will work up, if not a collection like this, at least a monograph.     --V.

Perhaps by then there will be more than n copies of his timeless Problems and Solutions. And  we can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by  Iosef Orbeli.

What strikes me as self-contradicting in the fable of Lucifer's fall - which, by the way, I seem to recall to be more speculation than based on biblical text, but my ex RCism may be showing - is that, as Benedikt pointed out, Lucifer had perfect nature, yet he had the free will to \\\"choose\\\" evil.  But where did that choice come from?  We know from Genesis that Eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a tempter which many assume was Satan, but how did Lucifer discover, invent, create, call the action what you will, something that God had not given origin to?  Also, where in the Bible is there mention of Lucifer's free will? We make a big fuss about mankind having free will, but it strikes me as being an after-the-fact rationalisation, and in fact, like salvation, not one that all Christians believe in identically.  At least in my mind, salvation and free will are very tightly coupled, but then my theology was Roman Catholic...  Still, how do theologian explain Lucifer's fall?  If Lucifer had perfect nature (did man?) how could he fall?  How could he execute an act that (a) contradicted his nature and (b) in effect cause evil to exist for the first time?\",\"OFM replies to a question on the multiplicity of translations of the bible,   Unfortunately, this isn't true.  On another news group earlier this year, someone posted that the King James Bible was the divinely inspired version of the Bible in English and was, therefore, inerrant; all other English translations were from Satan, trying to deceive the body of Christ.  A few years ago, the pastor of a church I was attending showed me a poster advertising the availability of a certain man to address congregations. Very prominantly on the poster was the fact that the man used only the KJV. The idea that the KJV is THE English Bible is more prevalent than many might think.    -- Scott at Brandeis\",\"David posts a good translation of a post by Suat Kinikliouglu:  [most of the original post elided]     [KK] ***** VATAN SEVGISI RUHLARI KIRDEN KURTARAN EN KUVVETLI RUZGARDIR *****     In translation, as a public service:  [most of the translation elided]     ***** THE LOVE OF THE FATHERLAND IS THE STRONGEST OF ALL WINDS CLEANSING          FILTH OFF SOULS *****  I think this part of the translation is questionable. Although I think the original quote is plain silly, you made it sound as if it is coming from a neo-nazi youth. For example, Turks talk of a \\\"motherland\\\" not a Germanic \\\"fatherland\\\". Why \\\"filth\\\" instead of \\\"dirt\\\"? The indeterminacy of translation is a well-known problem [1] so one may have to \\\"fudge\\\", but with some care of course.

I don't even particularly care for the idea.  But am I the only one that finds the sort of overreaction above just a *little* questionable?  You must find things like the Moon *really* obnoxious in their pollution.  A few questions for those frothing at the mouth to ask themselves:   1) How long is this thing supposed to stay up?  Sounds like it would have a *huge* drag area, not a lot of mass, and be in a fairly low orbit.   2) Just what orbital parameters are we talking about here? What real impact are we talking about, really?  How many optical astronomers are *really* going to be impacted?   3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of 'seeing' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data the sensors are supposed to return along with the data for large inflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)? The choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising is being used to help fund this thing.   4) If your answer to 3) above was \\\"the astronomers\\\", then feel free to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more important research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.  In other words, put up or shut up.   Probably so.  I'm just not sure we agree about who the 'stupid' are.    Yeah, me too.  --  \\\"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live  in the real world.\\\"   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden\",\" I used to think this way, and not just about X. For example, incorrect English constructs such as \\\"its raining\\\" or \\\"it's window id\\\" annoy me. However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically superior as well!).  On a related topic, who is to say that \\\"color\\\" is more or less correct than \\\"colour\\\" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed to American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API terms such as \\\"XAllocColor\\\" and \\\"colormap\\\".  In a world that uses the term \\\"Windows\\\" to refer to Microsoft Windows, perhaps the time has come to accept \\\"X Windows\\\" as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say, \\\"the X Window System\\\" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it. Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short, snappy, descriptive title (\\\"X\\\" is positively obscure) will help when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should be called \\\"Microsoft Windows\\\" or \\\"the Microsoft Window System\\\" or how about just plain \\\"Microsoft\\\"!  To summarise (or should that be \\\"summarize\\\") the point of this message: I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system (or should that be \\\"windowing system\\\"). Whatever gets recognised is fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System. \",\"Roland HS-60 (SynthPlus 60)   - 6 voice polyphonic fully programmable analog synthesizer   - 61 full size keys   - MIDI   - Memory to store 128 patches   - built in speakers   - Connectors: MIDI in thru out, Input(2), Expansion Pedal, Head Phones,     Tape Load & Save, Patch Shift, Pedal Hold, Output(2)  Asking $225\",\"  The chip and algorithm are classified.

OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,     and distribution.  Digital immortality.  The basic idea behind \\\"digital immortality\\\" is that computer networks    are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be there...and someone will dig them up.     If that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is  breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will  travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.   Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and  let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption... that's what they're here for.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  WHERE?               OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.       141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site     sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite   (you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)  Merely \\\"anonymous FTP\\\" to either site on Internet and change to the appropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the \\\"bin\\\" command to make sure you're in binary.  OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North America....the following systems have a substancial supply of OTIStuff...

What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely    photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me (email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received, it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works are also welcome.  OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.   GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to  see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at  most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit tougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,   you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change     JPG files to a standard GIF format.   OTIS also accepts animation files.        When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You  can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of  emailing).  If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send copies to:  The OTIS Project c/o Ed Stastny PO BX 241113 Omaha, NE 68124-1113  I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will   scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.   Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line  description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what the images are to be named, include those as well.     Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please contact me and we'll arrange things.  If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\\\" disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back. This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP, but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or JPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather not have to.  At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they can stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to  get a slab-o-OTIS.  As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.   Email me for current archive size and directory.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  DISTRIBUTION?  The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely    on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local  bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the appropriate text files along with the images.     It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.  It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite BBS system....or even just post this \\\"info-file\\\" there.  It would be keen of you.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  USE?  If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory, you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the  stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or full address credit).  You will either find this in the \\\".rm\\\" file for     the image or series of images...or in the \\\"Artists\\\" directory under the  Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have  to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for  you, or give you their contact information.   When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  NAMING IMAGES?  Please keep the names of your files in \\\"dos\\\" format.  That means, keep the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or four digit \\\"code\\\" for the series of images, plus the series number. Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something like:    ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC  Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems.     ----------------------------------------------------------------------   CREATING IMAGE FILES?  When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in case they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title, address or other information you'd like people to know.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  HMMM?!  That's about it for now.  More \\\"guidelines\\\" will be added as needed. Your input is expected.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS          (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,       or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations       however.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original         image files.  The files will go to the public at large.         It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone       could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.             Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS       takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights       revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to        give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed        electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed            all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is       NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or       broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not        limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,               screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific       permission for this sort of usage.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Remember, the operative term is \\\"stimulate\\\".

Please help since my mechanic and me are clueless!...\",\" I don't meant to defend Eric Molas- I find it somewhat annoying when someone pops up on alt.atheism to tell us all about his (usually atheistic) beliefs, so I can certainly see how Christians might be annoyed- but I'd like to point out a few things.   \\\"no meaning from God\\\" is not the same as \\\"no meaning\\\". From my (atheistic) point of view, if you want meaning in your life, you get to go and get some or make some.  No free gifts of meaning. (I never quite understood how any God can just \\\"give\\\" your life meaning, actually. If he says you exists to do or be X, that gives you a purpose if you care to accept it, but is that the same thing? But I digress...)    This would truely be a miserably existance, which I doubt Eric endures. Life can be enjoyable, so you can live it because you like it, or purposefull, so you can live it to get something done. One should endeavour to make it so, if it is not. Otherwise it would be as you say. Terrible.   Probably true. Remeber he almost certainly sees that particular joy as an illusion, and does not want it. So maybe it isn't so bad?   As an atheist, I am free to be a human person. I think, love, choose, and create.   Ah, now here we begin to diverge. I will not live forever with anyone.  (I don't think you will either, but you are welcome to your opinion on the matter.)   I tend to agree with you.  It's my opinion that (unlike drugs) religions are normal parts of human societies.  I think they have outlived their usefullness, but they are evidently quite ordinary, normal things that haven't proved lethal to humanity yet.   I have heard this claim quite a few times. Does anybody here know who first came up with the \\\"God-shaped hole\\\" business?   You might want to provide some evidence next time you make a claim like this.   I don't know Eric, but I do not think it is wise to assume he has a less joy-filled and abundant life because he holds certain beliefs.  ---    - Dan Johnson And God said \\\"Jeeze, this is dull\\\"... and it *WAS* dull.

Any information is appreciated.   Thanks in advance.\",\"Hi... can anybody give me book or reference title to give me a start at  fractal image compression technique. Helps will be appreciated... thanx\",\"Due to the resolution and size it is in 14 parts.  This is a uuencoded bitmap.  960X600 256 colors. The picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background. The size is just right for centered wallpaper on a 1024x768 display because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons to fit in without being on top of the picture. Reguarding image quality and resolution - I have not seen much better.  For those of you who haven't worked with pieced image files, here is how to put it back together.  1. save the 14 parts to 14 individual files  2. use a text editor to remove the header and footer     in each file.  3. concatinate all the parts into a single file  4. uudecode the file There are tools available to do this without the hassle such as uuconvert (UNIX) and UUcoder (Windows).  If neccesary I could post these tools or where to get them by FTP -- let me know. ------------ Part 1 of 14 ------------ begin 644 ROMAN.BMP M0DT:S0@``````!H#```,````P`-8`@$`\\\"``H,%4L*%DX2%G*E95(4'U9:8&% M@?HT-%T,,$A`55U]?>K*=769QLY(1,Y9<77*RLJJUN(P/%UI@8D8&%E(3%D0 M/%VZNKI55?)U@<[*JJH42&U$55DH*'&RVOH857T0/&$X4%6-KL:JSOH@>;:) MB>HT/%D42'%=7<Y$1'V9F?_*B8DL,%D858&=KO^-MKH<89&5H?_*:6DDA<HL M,%W*OKX8584\\\\2&%U<?I$0%DT-'$<896%H<X@;:7*G9V-I>)(684D>;8<89FA MI:65NM9QA;(@;:H\\\\2&G*?7UYB<8D>;IYD;8T1%G&QL9E=94HA<H01&504(59 M5?\\\\H)%W*LK*VMK9978E]A?I,55DHA<XP,&'&^OI$2%F)D?(44'G*D9%]F:%E M8?HP.%5(885,68FAMOIM>;+*<7'*QL:VXO\\\\878V5G>Y`4%UA<84<:9TX1%T0 M.%EU?<K*I:441&D<::$84'E`/%D@(%T@=;(X,%E,887*A84D@<*)F?(84'V^ M]OHX3%5(76EU=>(@*%!I;;(D(%4@=;8<78W*966AQNK\\\"PL(D@<;*NKJ1B?]] MH:5MA=XHC=8P0%D<79&RLK)5685]>?HL+%T@::$\\\\/'&1D?+*F9F9LO^!E>I0 M4*6AH:$\\\\,%EM:>J5KN)A8;I(4%D\\\\1&6=LO;*>7EI=:ZZZOH,-%`X.%E$4&DT M-*&EOOH00&&=NNHLC=;*KJZZZO\\\\43'&5I?I9686ESMZRYNX00&5$/&6JVNX4 M3'7*C8T<'%G2^O^!D<X8685$1%EIA9D43'DX0%7*;6W*PL*VWOH868E`3%F^ MOKX<99DT2%5M:?](2'U588U(65TP-%D@<:K*H:&!H;8\\\\55FNKJY]?=HD?;H< M99TX0%V9I?^-KJZESNX@<:Y95=+*@8&1NKYM;<IA=7DD?;Y56:55896-KK(H MB<YUD9U077E096E$0*6RTOK*MK8X0&6^\\\\OI(4'FJQOJ9QL8HB=*9D?](2/(` M``````````````````````````````````````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`=]W=0$E)W4!W=W>%W=UWW7=)=W=`=W=W M2>-`A4!)2>/C=W?CA>-)=^-)22-WXTE)XTGCXX6%0.-)0$!)X^-)X^/C2>/C MXTE[X^/CXTGCX^/C>^/CX^/CBDF*24E[BN/7XXKCBN.*BN/CX^-[XXKCXWLR MX^/CBHJ*,GOC>S).>^/C,HI.XS**,GN*3GN*BDXRBHI8,GN*6(I8BHJ*BC(R M6(J*>S**BDXRBHI.,O/S3DY.Y_-.BN=.,HJ*6//G\\\\_.*,DY8YS)8Y_-8\\\\TY.

In order to turn the spacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be available, or you need to retrain a new team.  Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed. Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA  series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set. Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a \\\"standby\\\" mode for use in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is still required to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is relatively cheap.  Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance to stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin- stabilized control mode because it would require little power or  maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time to time.  In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money), but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.\",\"I want to press a function key and have a text string appear in an XmText widget.

Numerous articles in major newspapers  (London Times) and periodicals (Newsweek) during the war, had suggested  the existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the  Nazis. Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to  deal with this issue extensively. Derounian's motives were twofold: his  deeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt  obliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history. Concurrently, Derounian embarked on what one would call 'crisis control'  or face-saving. In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger  Armenian community in the United States, he marginalized collaboration  as deplorable but insignificant.[1]  [1] John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), 'The Plotters,'     E. P. Dutton & Company, Inc., New York 1946, p. 182.    Source: \\\"Mitteilungsblatt, Berlin, December 1939, Nr. 2 and 5-6\\\"   Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately   forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi   collaboration.   A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft  is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The   magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany  and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the  magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,  is attention-getting.   This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically  important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be  an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.    In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain  political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They   occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.  The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered   \\\"Aryan\\\" and what befell them.  Now wait, there is more.  Source: \\\"From Sardarapat to Sevres and Lausanne\\\" by Avetis Aharonian.

So a \\\"hourglass\\\" cursor should be shown when the application is busy, or a \\\"caution\\\" cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in another. Defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level. So defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain subpart of it, is a rather complicated matter. When cursors have been defined for some windows, e.g. a \\\"crosswire\\\" cursor for a DrawingArea, things get even more complicated. My intuition says that things should be easier, but is this so? If anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem, please let me know.

I'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I can help a little.    Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects for both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on high-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames per second).     It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is. True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations.  Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15 frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general does not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the UNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time operation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes.  Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time operation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not even SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due to their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.  From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2 systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.    You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop VR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

A NASA friend and I spent one    drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar we'd need    to put the golden arches of a certain American fast food organization    on the face of the Moon.  Fortunately, we sobered up in the morning.  Hmmm. It actually isn't all that much, is it? Like about 2 million km^2 (if you think that sounds like a lot, it's only a few tens of m^2 per burger that said organization sold last year). You'd be best off with a reflective substance that could be sprayed thinly by an unmanned craft in lunar orbit (or, rather, a large set of such craft). If you can get a reasonable albedo it would be visible even at new moon (since the moon itself is quite dark), and _bright_ at full moon. You might have to abandon the colour, though.  Buy a cheap launch system, design reusable moon -> lunar orbit unmanned spraying craft, build 50 said craft, establish a lunar base to extract TiO2 (say: for colour you'd be better off with a sulphur compound, I suppose) and some sort of propellant, and Bob's your uncle.  I'll do it for, say, 20 billion dollars (plus changes of identity for me and all my loved ones). Delivery date 2010.  Can we get the fast-food chain bidding against the fizzy-drink vendors? Who else might be interested?  Would they buy it, given that it's a _lot_ more expensive, and not much more impressive, than putting a large set of several-km inflatable billboards in LEO (or in GEO, visible 24 hours from your key growth market). I'll do _that_ for only $5bn (and the changes of identity).\",\" The sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside of the orbit of Mercury.  The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observed perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to Newtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations and calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later improved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's system of equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit of Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was afoot with Mercury.  But alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rate it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly curved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915 and Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian  geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of it's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession of Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb's numbers rather than Leverrier's.)  Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and that's fine.  But subsequent efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar have been fruitless.  -Bill Gawne   \\\"Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe   are the laws of the universe.\\\"                       - G.

In fact, one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in person is that I can key in on him instead of watching what I'd probably be seeing on tv.  He does so many subtle things behind the play.  He said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad stressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have to learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took that advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrived in Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldn't and wouldn't play a lick of defense.  It's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought all of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he has certainly helped, and even ol' Kjell has been steady.  But looking at this team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-up permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it wouldn't matter.  If I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would be 1) Tom Barrasso; 2) Ron Francis; 3) Larry Murphy.  (I'd love to put Francis first but I do think the only thing that could really damage the Pens right now would be to lose Barrasso.)\",\" >With that in mind...

The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the   maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the  characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility  in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font  file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters  appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on.  Well, yes, both Type 1 and TrueType fonts can contain lots of characters. And in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to Windows ANSI in Windows, and to Mac standard roman encoding on the Mac.  No difference there between T1 and TT!     And as for fonts with thousands of glyphs, right know these are a liabiliaty rather than a great new thing.  Reason is that a font with 3000 characters is very large, and if you can only access 224 of them you are paying a heavy price in downloading time and printer storage.  (And at the moment there is only one program of that uses `partial font downloading')   For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows  char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font  is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac  char set.    Yes and T1 text fonts all have the `ISO Adobe' character set, which is a superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding.  The question is whether you can get at the glyphs.  In Windows, for example, you cannot get at the ligatures `fi' anfd `fl' (both T1 and TT)even though a font may very well have them.  ANd, while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type 1 font and to create a new Windows metric file (PFM) for it, there are utilities out there to allow you do this.  How do I reencode a TrueType font?  How can I get at the `fi' and `fl' ligatures in Windows (or on the Mac)?  Are there utilities that make it possible to circumvent the hard-wired Windows ANSI encoding?      > Regards,                                            1001-A East Harmony Road    > Bob Niland                                          Suite 503    > Internet:  rjn@csn.org                              Fort Collins CO 80525    > CompuServe: 71044,2124                              (303) 223-5209 \",\"For Sale...:           Three software packages for IBM PC and compatible computers:                     o Wing Commander deluxe edition                 o Includes Secret Missions 1 & 2                 o Includes all original packaging, manuals                   and disks                 o Includes registration card (so you can                   send it in and register it in your name)                 o Original price for Wing Commander: $69.95                 o Original price for Secret Missions I: $29.95                 o Original price for Secret Missions II: $29.95                 o Total original price: $129.85                 o My asking price for all these of these                   games TOGETHER is $65.00                 o Wing Commander and the Secret Missions is a                   battle and flight simulator set in space.

Any thoughts on the new (old) Reds uniforms.  I remember seeing a Pete Rose rookie card, and unless I miss my guess he was wearing the exact same duds.    The Mets (HOW ABOUT DOC'S PERFORMANCE TODAY?!!!!!) have reinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the Mets insgnia on the front of the jersey.  To my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since 1962, and it reminds me a little of the Dodger logo.    Many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional. (Phillies, Reds, Expos, White Sox, Padres, etc.) and the once bright colors have been altered to gray.  The trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties.

One might find oneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near term that require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting a few weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December with preferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.  2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations of what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects beside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given to unsophisticated investors in late 1986 to \\\"sell now and save on taxes.\\\"  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similar advice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advice was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986), but merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates (without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).  It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal economic interest.  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless pulleys, though, this sort of thinking often fails to describe accurately what happens in the real world.  \",\"  So does that mean that anyone who is a Christian to avoid Hell isn't really a Christian at all?

But not all of them did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.  Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively swollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there's nothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include: psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most -- maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental toxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of these.

The trouble with regulations is  that they only tell you what you are no longer permitted to do, not what  you should do instead.       I think the cause of the new regulations is the Montreal Protocol  which has a definite CFC-phase-out schedule.  (Of course the cause of  the Montreal Protocol was all the research done on the causes of the  Ozone Depletion Problem.)       Someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast  to ban the ozone-depleting (CFC) chemicals and not gasolines and other  greenhouse-gas-producing compounds.  The greenhouse effect (produced by  infrared-trapping gasses like CO2 and methane) and the ozone-hole problem  (produced by long-lived, chlorine-containing molecules) are not the same  thing.  It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's  (chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which  are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms.  Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help  the greenhouse-gas problem, but would do nothing for the ozone problem.   Fred W.

And what does it show?     Re: RMS readings  Unless the DVM *says* it's measuring RMS, it's probably Average voltage. The input is diode rectified and measured as DC.  If it says it's RMS and but measures square/triangle/etc.  incorrectly, it's measuring average and multipling by a correction that's *only* true for sine waves (i.e.  Vave*(0.707/0.63) = Vrms).  If you want correct RMS for (most) any waveform, you need a \\\"True-RMS\\\" DVM/DMM which literally does the Root-Mean-Square calculation in either analog or digital circuitry.  :  :    Related question (less important to me): :    What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with  : analog ones?

It does not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime in the first place.  The true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually stop one from murdering.  (Or commiting treason -- are there any other capital crimes anywhere in the USA?)  That is, if there were no death penalty, would its introduction deter a would-be criminal from committing her/his crime?  I doubt it.  This is only the first step.  Even if it were a strong deterrent (short of being a complete deterrent) I would reject it.  For what about the case of the innocent executed?  And even if we could eliminate this possibility, I would reject the death penalty as immoral. This makes me something of a radical on the issue, although I think there are many opponents of captial punishment who agree with me, but who find the innocent executed the strongest argument to make.  I would, if magically placed in charge, facilitate state-aided suicide for criminals who have life-sentences.  This could be a replacement for capital punishment.

Take a look at Great Britain sometime for a  nice history on drug criminalization.  The evidence there shows that during periods of time when drugs (such as heroin) were illegal, crime went up and people did die from bad drugs.  During times when drugs were legalized, those trends were reversed.   Now this is a great example of an ironclad proof.  Gosh, I'm convinced. ( :-} for the humor impaired).  First, assert something for which you have no evidence, then dodge requests for proof by claiming to know what this group was intended for.  As to research, if you'd done any at all, you'd realize that there is plenty of reason to believe that legalizing drugs will have many benefits to society.  There are some plausible arguments against it, too, but they aren't enough to convince me that criminalization of drugs is the answer.  I'm willing to be convinced I'm wrong, but I seriously doubt the likes of you can do it. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ...Dale Cook    \\\"Any town having more churches than bars has a serious                    social problem.\\\" ---Edward Abbey The opinions are mine only (i.e., they are NOT my employer's)\",\"If anyone has the current Moto Guzzi National Owners Club address please e-mail it to me.

Mitra is Sanskrit for Friend, as such He started out as an avatar of Lord Visnu  mentioned first in the Vedas. Later he seems to have risen to chief prominence  worshipped by the Persians. Associated with the Sun but NOT the Sun, he is  the lord of contract honor and obedience, therefore naturally worshipped by  soldiers. He was ordered by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and He reluct-  antly agreed because of His obligation...the blood of that bull spilled and  grew all earth life...then Mitra and the Sun sat down to eat.  Worship of Lord Mitra ended in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians.  Hundreds of years later He was rediscovered and thrown into the Official Roman  Pantheon (tm) for some semi-tricky reason, I forget why. But all references of  Him ended abruptly when He was stricken from same, so apparently His worship  was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy, like membership  in the Communist Party was in the Soviet Bloc. The sociology of religion in  ancient times is fascinating!  Oh, His B-day was 25 Dec. Ahem.  I am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after His was booted from the  Roman Imperial God Roster or what. It contained mostly soldiers, with 7 levels  of initiation. They worshipped underground in caverns in pews. The bull horns  in those temples were for scaring away or impaling evil spirits, I'm not sure  that they had Mithraic significance or not.  I don't know that the ritual meal was of a cannibalistic nature as is the  Christian masses. But eating deities goes way back to Old Kingdom Egypt.  Someone mentioned bullfighting. Did Mithraists sacrifice bulls? I forget. More  likely, for a religious source, might be the shower of bull's blood enjoyed  by the worshippers of Cybele on the Day of Blood? Cybele worship extended all  throughout even up to France bigtime.\",\"Mark Gregory Foster writes (concerning 1 Corinthians 16:2):   > The idea was introduced to me once that the reason Paul wanted  > the Corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the  > first day of the week was that this was when they received their  > weekly wages.

Is anyone out there in Christendom listening? If so, why don't we get some dialog going here?  Here's a topic to get things started. My daughter's Christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sent something *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of a national (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible.   What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding impossible without sparking a holy war.   Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming sacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days. Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think it is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it happen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand.

I've never seen her ump a game. I have no first hand experience with her ability as an umpire.  But I have seen her on talk shows. And her point seems to be that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. It seems to me that she is missing the point and if that's how she sees the role of umpires in the game, well I wouldn't promote her either.  The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners safe or out; hell, Joe Lundy could do that. Their primary function is to maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the players from trying to kill each other.   Umpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies most of us, both men and women. And if Ms. Postema thinks that she deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of the rulebook, then I think that disqualifies her as well. Umpires need to command the game; command of the rulebook is secondary.   \",\" A word of warning, though:  Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable locks under the Kryptonite name.

For about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock (advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both, Kryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel). I chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.  First, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by the Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards of quality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable lock with the Kryptonite name on it.  Secondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I don't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes it would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.  Thirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the  dark.  I didn't try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the  lock mechanism would stand up to an \\\"insert screwdriver and TORQUE\\\" attack.  Fourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to  deter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).  All cables suffer the weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time.  If you are patient you can cut cables with fingernail clippers.  Aviation snips would go  through the cable in well under a minute.    -- \",\"Could some kind soul out there e-mail me the 411 on where I can find the mlb.c   program?

I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, I have other xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning.  In case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles, here's a crude picture:   ====================== Figure 1 ====================================  |  |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+  |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C +  |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+  |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C, but +  |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  +  |    +      window, window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     +  |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+  |  ====================== Figure 1 ====================================  Squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack, with easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really need, since I also insist on having a virtual WM.  The only problem is that the title location is static, that is,  it is configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and time-consuming.  Therefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right } functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click of a button, you can change this:      +---------+     + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+  to this:                     +---------+                    + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+   ===============  Okay.

One way would be to post, in comp.windows.x, a description of this enhancement, together with an explanation of why I think it is a Very Good Thing, and hope that someone reads it. :-)  In case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing, look back up at Figure 1, and picture window A moved over on top of windows B and C; now window A's title hides Window B's title; but when you hit f.squeezecenter, the result is:          +=========+   +---------+   +=========+         + title B +   + title A +   + title C +         +-------------------------------------+         +   this is the body of the window,   +         +   window A, which is on top.        +         +-------------------------------------+   ===================  The rest of this posting explains how to implement it, based on my X11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the full diffs would be too long.  The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the ExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c:  #ifdef SHAPE  case F_SQUEEZELEFT:  { static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT, 0, 0 };   if (DeferExecution (context, func, Scr->SelectCursor))     return TRUE;    tmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze;   SetFrameShape( tmp_win );   break;  }  .... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and  squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ... #endif  ( Of course, you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h   and add     { \\\"f.squeezeleft\\\", FKEYWORD, F_SQUEEZELEFT },      ... and so forth ... to parse.c  In order to use these functions, add something like the following to your .twmrc file:  Button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter   =================  About a year ago, I posted this, but our news was broken and I *think* it didn't get out.

If you check the THN stats for Kansas City, you'll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having played in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the 4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible.   Well, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isn't quite accurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing, which was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because he knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which point he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks and he disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not reporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as injured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped him down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly not with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a no-no).  Very nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was hurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably another expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of his career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players motivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a bad judgement call.     Always gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but hustle isn't always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me one night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to hold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto's neck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turned around and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter wasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.  The Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbie McDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me \\\"you have to make room for the kids\\\". Carter, in fact, refused to report to K.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto retirement, but I haven't heard anything official. His only hope in hockey now is the Gulls.    Because, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked fairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I didn't think he was quite ready to make the jump to the NHL.   Agreed (BTW, I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you wish they'd performed than how they actually performed.

The technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key.  If the frequency path depends on they key, as I understand it to, it *could* be made effectively impossible to record.  Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule today.  But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain cellular calls and then ask a judge, \\\"Hey, can we have permission to listen to those tapes?\\\" can they?   Yes, that is a major concern, but I think that they think they can win just by having 99.5% of the USA use this system.  They don't even have to care about the cautious .5% that's left.

In expanded muxed mode, you *could* do it. Much easier if you get a DRAM controller IC.

TORTURE.  /* Written  4:41 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */ /* ---------- \\\"From Israeli press. TORTURE.\\\" ---------- */ FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.  Newspaper: Ma'ariv Date: 18. December 1992 Author: Avi Raz  Subject: Torture  Title of article: Moderate physical pressure  Several times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation room in Tulkarm prison, during which he says he was humiliated, beaten and tortured, Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator, a Shabak agent 'Captain Louis', chatting on the phone with his wife. \\\"At those moments\\\", Omar said, \\\"I felt that he was like a humanbeing, but right after he finished talking, he would be beat me and say, 'You listened to the conversation and enjoyed yourself' and I understood that he was not really a human being\\\".  In late October 1992, after 38 days in detention at Tulkarm prison, Omar Jaber was released without charges. \\\"Among the Jews, as among the Arabs, there are good people and bad people\\\", he said after his release, \\\"but there, in Tulkarm, in the interrogations rooms, you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that he is a human being\\\". Although he left the detention installation in Tulkarm bruised and humiliated (\\\"I sat at home for ten days. My hands shook from nerves\\\"), one may consider Omar Jaber lucky: He got out, not so healthy, but entire, and even ultimately returned to normal functioning, at the small solar heater plant he owns.  In contrast, Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi, for example, was released seven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in the Shabak wing, cut off from his surroundings. He doesn't speak or react. Mustafa Barakat, aged only 23, who was arrested in early August and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation, left it one day later - dead. \\\"We have recently received an especially large number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at the Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators\\\", noted Dr. Niv Gordon, director of the Association of Israel and Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights. (...)  The right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan Saber Makhlouf, a 20 year old student. In fact, he was extremely fearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated in Tulkarm prison, in case the publication in the paper would return him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment.  (...follow description of tortures....)  Omar, a tall bearded man, was silent. \\\"I do not want to talk about it\\\", he finally said, quietly. Some time later, embarrased and ashamed, he spoke: \\\"Sometimes he beats you and beats you until you'll kiss his hand, and not only his hand. Even the hands of another interrogator, and another, whom he calls into the room, later if I want, you will kiss my ass.\\\"  These things take place in an Israeli army detention installation, located within the military government compound in Tulkarm (West Bank). But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. In early March the IDF allowed representatives of B'Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories, to visit Tulkarm prison, but denied them access to the interrogation wing. \\\"The interrogation wing is Shabak property, being solely under Shabak responsibility. All interrogations are performed by it\\\", said Lieutnant Sharon Sho'an, the commander of the installation, according to the internal report written by B'tselem member, Yuval Ginbar, following the visit. Major David Pe'er, governing commander of the prison system in the Central Command, was quoted in the report:  \\\"There is an ethical problem here - no one can enter the interrogation wing\\\".\",\" Sorry, I misread your remark about young men and women.  (Though I am now unsure what that sentence does mean.)   You implied that anyone who wants to send troops to Bosnia wants to do so to help the \\\"butchers of their choice\\\".  Since the primary targets of help are Muslim victims of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", you imply that such Muslim victims are butchers.   This implies both sides are equal.  True, it may sometimes be difficult or impossible to determine which side is the victim, but that does not mean that victims do not exist.  Would you, in WWII have said that there were atrocities on the sides of both the Jews and the Germans?   Yes, but both sides want different things.  The Muslims chiefly want to not be \\\"ethnic cleansed\\\".  The Serbians want to \\\"ethnic cleanse\\\" the Muslims.  It is indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants, but the things that the two sides want are not equivalent.   I recall, before we did anything for Somalia, (apparent) left-wingers saying that the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to Somalia was because the Somalis are third-worlders who Americans consider unworthy of help.

One aim of experiments is to investigate the validity of the hyptheses resulting from the models produced by this thinking process.   Science has one advantage of all other approaches to explaining the world. It is objective.   Anything which affects the physical world can be studied.  For example, since we are part of the physical world, anything (including spirits) which affects our behaviour can be observed.  Science does not make any claims about the existence or non-existence of objects which do not affect the physical world.   The purpose of science is to produce a model of the *physical* world.  The model must be able to explain all past observations and predict the outcome of future observations.  One of the aims of experiments is to carry out well defined observations which are objective.  Ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world, and the model which realises on the minimal number of assumptions.  At the moment models which do not rely on the assumption of some *spiritual* world existing are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a *spiritual* world.  As the non-spiritual models has fewer assumptions it should be the currently accepted models.  The scientific process never assumes that its present models are the correct ones, whereas many religions claim to represent the truth.  The arrogance of many theists is that they claim to represent the truth, this cannot be said of scientists.\",\" I was waiting for this. I think your question should be rephrased. The many verses of the Bible which condem homosexuality (by our beliefs) have been shoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by (well-meaning?) Christians. The question is how do they interpret these verses. Any discussion of any issue (this or any other issue) requires a proof of your case as well as a disproof of the opposing view. We are already familiar with those verses and many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour. We must now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on the interpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips with them.\",\"Have you considered the Apple Laserwriter IIg.

Anyway, turning the thread around, the other day I played tennis during my lunch hour.  I'm out of tennis shape so it was very intense exercise.  I got overheated, and dehydrated.  Afterwards, I noticed a tingling sensation all over my head then about 2 hours later, I could feel a migraine start.  (I continued to drink water in the afternoon.) I took cafergot, but it didn't help and the pain started although it wasn't as intense as it usually is and about 9pm that night, the pain subsided.  This isn't the first time that I've had a migraine occur after exercise.

That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something    they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be    verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the    chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the    output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output    bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.     If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that    some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that    they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,    DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output    change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think    NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.  Consider a cryptosytem that starts out by XORing bits 23 and 47, and not using either of these bits except through this XOR. This system makes early use of every bit. but an exhaustive key search would now only have 2^79 keys to search. Your test by varying single key bits wouldn't turn up anything interesting.     Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see    the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased    subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The algorithm I suggest above would stick out like a sore thumb, but I'm sure I could design a system with a more subtle key redundancy which was well-hidden, but would still make an exhaustive key search take far less than 2^80 encryptions. I don't believe your claim that the real keysize can be verified externally.\",\") )That's your mistake.

(And I suspect that there are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to Christianity.)

Atheists don't believe in any sort of afterlife.    I think it's safe to say that Hell was never intended metaphorical. Certainly  not the equivalent of ceasing to exist.

That's because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  Like so many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.  I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I deign from commenting much further.   Now hold it.  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as many other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that Christians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily being arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute, but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.    Not quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably* determine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible human beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The  distinction is subtle yet important.  When a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results are reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could have been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken, without sacrificing his convictions.  Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty. Throughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know with complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the right direction when he uttered, \\\"Cogito, ergo sum,\\\" yet we have not advanced much beyond that.  Do you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that the computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely certain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course, you have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all practical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with Christianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about absolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability  that they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do)  abandon these absolutes.   As I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does not mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to  render all doubts unreasonable. \",\"Did you remember to clamp ground to the engine block first?\",\"[Most info regarding dangers of reading from Floppy disks omitted]  In all fairness, how many people do you know personally who read images from Floppy drives?

They probably can't tell Clippered voice from Clippered triple-DESed voice until they get their copy of your key.  Any criminal who's going to use encryption will do it under cover of Clipper.  The only way to avoid this will be to try to prohibit strong encryption.  I probably shouldn't say this, but they could try to detect the use of an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statistical properties of the plaintext.  An old-fashioned wiretap could then detect the use of pre-encryption, which would drastically increase the measured entropy of the input.  A countermeasure to this would be to use steganographic techniques which put out voice.

The athiest's position is that there is no PROOF of the existence of God.  As much as some people accept their Church, their priests or straight from their own scriptures as the \\\"proof\\\", this does not  satisfy atheists.

What they dispute is that Churches, priests, scriptures etc. represent true authorities and know the TRUTH.   Are you asking us to believe blindly?  You are trying to deny that part of us that makes us ask the question \\\"Does God exist?\\\" i.e. self-awareness and reason.

I don't find anywhere that God restricts heaven to particular    ethnic groups or religious denominations or any other category    that we humans like to drop people into. But He does REQUIRE    that we believe and trust Him. In Hebrews it says that God spoke    of old by the prophets (the old testament), but in these last days    he has spoken to us by His son Jesus Christ. And we learn of    Him through the pages of the New Testament. The Bible tells us    what we need to believe.

I   >don't know how a public-key system could work in this regard, but it might   [...]   heh heh... I posted this just before reading all the Clinton Chip messages..  I guess they beat me to it..  Anyway, I think it would be a great idea to  develop such a product, perhaps in the underground, as it would otherwise  probably become illegal pretty quickly here...  It's really very feasible and shouldn't be too expensive - all that's needed is a box with a phone jack on one side, a DSP in the middle to do codec functions of speech->compressed bytestream, and an RS232 on the other side.  You'd plug your phone into it, plug the RS232 into your computer, and have a good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port.  The CPU in the middle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on a byte stream.  With v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream, it should work.  Quality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone.  At the very highest price, you could use one of those voice-mail compatible modems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 on the cost of such a box.  In practice, you really ought to be able to get the price well below $100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap&nasty home RISC box (Acorn Archimedes) with the digitising microphone I bought for 25 pounds, if I knew how to write good speech compression software (which I don't).  The reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one - the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip. Economics, I'm afraid.  However... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even with the bottleneck of a v32bis modem.  When we get ISDN for all (ha ha ha) and the new NREN, it might then be trivial to run compressed speech over a tcp/ip connection on the Internet.  Perhaps we should start thinking now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatible for everyone, and side-step the clipper stuff and use internet for all our phone calls in future :-)  [1/2 joking]\",\"PSA 145:9  The LORD is good to all: and his  tender  mercies  are over all his works.\",\" You assume this because you believe in a designing creator, and you observe our ability to procreate...   ....

What are people's experiences with these cars?  Daryl\",\"I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when I came across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for cooling components.  For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side to the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.  Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a couple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an efficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour).  Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the temperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably its power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no leakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more (although that would be a lousy way to control it).  What I would like to know is:  1: Are the above guesses correct?  2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?    (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm    too fast when I unplug it)  3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?

Then replace \\\"prince\\\" with \\\"government\\\" or \\\"president\\\", as appropriate, and read it again.    [From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by Daniel Donno.]   In order to keep their lands secure, some princes have disarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the cities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against themselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they initially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have destroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular circumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself will allow.   To begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince disarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he proceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their arms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal, while those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they are transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all, nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by extending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties and dangers should receive advantages.     When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by showing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you distrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you. Moreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would have to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been discussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be good enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful subjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired state has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is full of examples proving that this is so.   But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he annexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire it; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render soft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to his original domain.   ...\",\"     Lets just say it is DUI here now!   ----===== DoD #8177 = Technician(Dr. Speed) .NOT.

The Magellan spacecraft continues to operate normally, gathering gravity data to plot the density variations of Venus in the mid-latitudes.  The solar panel offpoint was returned to zero degrees and spacecraft temperatures dropped 2-3 degrees C.  2.  An end-to-end test of the Delayed Aerobraking Data readout process was conducted this week in preparation for the Transition Experiment.  There was some difficulty locking up to the data frames, and engineers are presently checking whether the problem was in equipment at the tracking station.  3.  Magellan has completed 7277 orbits of Venus and is now 32 days from the end of Cycle 4 and the start of the Transition Experiment.  4.  Magellan scientists were participating in the Brown-Vernadsky Microsymposium at Brown University in Providence, RI, this week.  This joint meeting of U.S. and Russian Venus researchers has been continuing for many years.\",\"I have the following Canon items for sale, the condition is listed as numerical. 10 indicates like new condition.

To increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed from 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively. This is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some aluminum foil down to work on.  1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case.  2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables,   spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out.  3. Remove the flopy drive.  4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting   the supply straight up and out.  5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom   side of the fan and lifting straight up and out.  6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and   right side of the board and sliding the board forward then   lifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the   board must be removed first)  7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules).   This is not easy even for a skilled solderer.  8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins   by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.  9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder    them in.  10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.  11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and    the other large chip just to the right of the processor and   figure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made a   simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole   in the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using   insulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat   sync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.   12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.

It's understandable--most corporate execs don't know much about cryptology, and it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil.  And, the proposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what exists now.      The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have to concern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSA has put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs, probably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the existence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say) a DES keysearch machine.      As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination could acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since it would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked jodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency or organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak- nesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for (say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the complaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars to build a keysearch machine for.)      How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of the GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?  How about home phones of major execs and important engineers and designers? \\\"Gee, Mr Jones, I understand you've had some financial problems lately. Maybe I can help...\\\"        Indeed, if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likely as secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However, the system as a whole isn't resistant to \\\"practical cryptanalysis.\\\"  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes how several NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despite security measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.  And NSA confidential data was *not* subject to being requested by thousands of police organizations and courts across the land.\",\"[reply to frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer)]         From A Dictionary of Philosophy, by Anthony Flew:   \\\"Objectivism:  The belief that there are certain moral truths that would remain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desired.  For instance, 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering' might be thought of as a plausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the contention remains true, just as '5 + 7 = 12' remains correct even if there is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor can they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding content;  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true in virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to action (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may talk of 'self-evident truths', but can he deny the subjectivist's claim that self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself.  To hold a moral opinion is, he suggests, not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human activity.\\\"\",\"Sorry for posting this here, but noone has replied to my post from the politics side of the group.

Imake support has been improved, a few defaults have been changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.  This is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will incorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will support X11R5 and Motif 1.2.x.  Note to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this distribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.  Here is the original ANNOUNCEMENT:  HISTORY  The University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation, has developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++ classes. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through member-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1. However, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only worked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no longer actively supported by the University of Lowell.  I, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell  bindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and enhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the general public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).  NEW RELEASE  I am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++ bindings.   This release offers:  - Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support - Support for Xbae widgetset  - Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate   progress in an application. - Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake        and its config files on your site. I have tried to        provide the bindings with a standard Makefile, tweakable        for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely        tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you        have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma        release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude        of platforms to test the Imake-files on. - Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs) - An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted   on Usenet.  WHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS  Ftp:  Anonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11.  Note:  Please be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large files during working hours.  Also note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this is an old version of the bindings.  E-mail:  Those who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and I will send the bindings by e-mail.  REQUEST  Those who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please contact me, and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of bugs, a bug-fix of course ;-).

They are pushing to get a standard in place, a secret standard, and if they get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market. It will be legal to sell better, untapable encryption that doesn't have registered keys, but it will be difficult, and thus not a plan for most phone companies.  You see, with clipper chip phones you'll be able to talk to any cellular company, or other phones or ports because they will follow the standard.  AT&T has already announced a clipper chip encryption product.  The government has marketed hard to get major vendors to use these chips.   If they get enough market share, they will rule.  And thus there will be very little market for systems that can't be tapped by the police.  The public isn't that concerned about it now, after all.  They freely do calls that anybody with an old TV can listen to today!  They won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure them only from the police.  Well, some people will buy these phones, but they will only work with other proprietary phones, so the market will be small and the phones expensive.  Unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them cheap, only the Mob will buy them.  And this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists of better encryption phones, because \\\"the only reason a person would want one is to evade the police.\\\"  Interesting.\",\" I think Murray has done a great job.

All of this in three years.  Has anyone done better?  The year before he took over, the Wings didn't even make the playoffs. There was about a year and a half during Demers' stint that the Wings did OK, but that was due to Demers' motavational skills and clutch and grab style.  They didn't have much talent.

The blast is believed to be the work of a suicide bomber. Radio reports said a car packed with butane gas exploded between two parked buses, one belonging to the IDF and the other civilian. Both busses went up in flames. The blast killed an Arab man who worked at a nearby snack bar in the Mehola settlement. An Israel Radio report stated that the other man who was killed may have been the one who set off the bomb. According to officials at the Haemek Hospital in Afula, the eight IDF soldiers injured in the blast suffered light to moderate injuries.  \",\": I'm in the market for all small (12x12 or so) digitizing tablet and would : like any comments.

[Quotations omitted.  This is in response to a question about the Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification up to our Catholic readers.  --clh]  There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the mention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the \\\"Annunciation\\\" by Angel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28   And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto  a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a  man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's  name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\\\"Hail,  thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed  art thou among women.\\\"_  Now, now, hold that line of thought - \\\"the Lord is with Mary & blessed art thou among women\\\" - while you read on....  In the book, \\\"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of Devotion to Mary\\\" by Peter Lappin:  The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible that the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title \\\"The Conception of Saint Anne\\\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter, just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary is the incorruptible timber \\\"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of Christ's sinless body\\\"; she is \\\"God's Eden, in whom there is no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\\\"  Her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her purity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus, she was hailed as \\\"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate, spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\\\". ... At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan, John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a  greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_. ...  Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin. From \\\"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\\\" by John A. Hardon:  Baptism - Concupiscence Remains after Baptism. Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of Christ Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).  Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall: In the light of the foregoing, we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over: -They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the  power to think and to choose freely. -The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality  and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires. -They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,  the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding  title to enter heaven. By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely.  Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's sin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day...  Going back to _Immaculate Conception_ (I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):  Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born  AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but STILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was: \\\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou amongst women\\\".  Even Mary was confused about this greeting.  Mary could very well have possessed all of the _treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents (Adam and Eve before their sin):     Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)     Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)     The Lord is with you (At those times, God would                 definitely want to be with those He                 has made _blessed_)     Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)  At the conception, God made Mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body of Christ and so,  Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still has maintained her Immaculate Heart. \",\" According to this morning's Post-Gazette:  The Pens will be carried by KDKA-Radio(1020 am), unless the Pirates are playing.  When the Pirates play, the games will be carried by  WDVE(102.5 fm).  WDVE will carry 12 games, starting with tonight's game.  In fact, after this season, KDKA will no longer be the flagship station for the Pens.  The Penguins and KBL have struck a new  deal regarding the TV and radio rights to the games.  It seems more than likely that WDVE will be the flagship radio station next  season.  KBL will carry 62 games on tv,  with 17 of the games to be  simulcast on KDKA-TV.  The remaining 22 games, as well as some of the  early round playoff games, will be available by \\\"subscription tv\\\" only. To receive the games, you'll have to pay a one time hook up fee, and then a monthly fee of $11-12 dollars.  Also, under the new deal, there will no longer be radio/tv  simulcasts.

[snip]   The 3DO box is based on an ARM RISC processor, one or two custom graphics chips, a DSP, a double-speed CDROM, and 2MB of RAM/VRAM. (I'm a little fuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and RAM/VRAM capacity).  It was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the Electronic Cafe in Santa Monica, CA. From 3DO, RJ Mical (of Amiga/Lynx fame) and Hal Josephson (sp?) were there to talk about the machine and their plan. We got to see the unit displaying full-screen movies using the CompactVideo codec (which was nice, very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft) ... and a very high frame rate to boot (like 30fps).  Note however that the 3DO's screen resolution is 320x240.  CompactVideo is pretty amazing... I also wanted to point out that QuickTime does indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was stated above... I'm sure if the material had been compressed at the large size then it would play back fine (I have a Q950 and do this quite a bit). The price of generality... personally I don't use the dynamic sizing of movies often, if ever. But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick on the latest 040 machines.

I haven't seen anybody write that AIDS was a *punishment* for certain types of sin (this includes Mark Ashley who you were responding to here).  I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way that curses will come on you and others.  Although one definition of 'curse' is 'retribution', I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used the word.  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in his Bible.  God doesn't cause curses, he warns us of them.  Kevin Davis wrote (a while ago):  The Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death (which is much worse than AIDS) -- we have all hurt God with our sin.  Paul Conditt reveals his feelings:  The first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is \\\"obvious\\\"ly wrong to be angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angry which is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at us for putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was \\\"forgive them Father, they know not what they do.\\\"  Knowing how forgiving Jesus has been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of love for Him.  Please don't give in to anger, it will only cause foolish quarrels and more bad feelings.  It's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need to address it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone out there was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with AIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I would frame a response something like this:  \\\"It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which is simply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishment for people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of his children equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  We will all be judged after we die, but until then we all have the opportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him with all of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of our sin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new life for him.  Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is not to short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart or a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even through the worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all men that they may perhaps reach out and find him.\\\"  The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears of people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing is actually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in the earlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't been expressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount your perceptions, but please try to be open-minded.  You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people because they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters and I do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of the city and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with some brothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so that you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.  The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual contracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their salvation in that there may be repetence involved.  The important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God's commands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm or misfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way to prevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways, is to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife or husband.  I hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.  Love,\",\"I've got an Eimac 818A/4PR1000A transmitter/linear amplifier tube, unused, in original packaging (but opened and inventoried).

No one suggests that :such analysis should be left to \\\"regulators.\\\"  In fact, the \\\"re-inventing :government\\\" movement provides just such a cost/benefit approach to the :analysis of public spending.  Libertarians would do well to learn more :about it.     Okay,  let me try to explain this.  When one votes for such a creature as a Senator or,  worse yet,  a President, one votes not for specific policies but for a general package which must cover all issues for 4 or 6 years.  As such,  one's influence is highly diluted. I might add that,  even if one were free to vote on individual regulations, the vast amount of time required for considering a particular regulation, combined with the very small chance of one's vote making a difference,  would make it unreasonable to expect the voter to make an intelligent decision with respect to specific regulations.      :Sorry, but it strikes me that it is the only \\\"feasible\\\" approach.  What is :not feasible is a wholesale attack on all government regulation and  :licensing that treats cutting hair and practicing medicine as equivalent :tasks.  I'm not sure what you mean by \\\"feasible\\\" in this case.  Do you mean that [] are impossible in priciple,  or merely that it would be undesirable in fact?   :Actually, the only areas of public spending above that strike me as  :generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense.  2 of the four you saw fit to  mention,  and education of minors is always another possibility,  since minors are generally considered not to be responsible to make their own decisions as adults are.  :(It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to :be to a principle of non-coercion, the only areas of public spending :that they frequently support involve hiring people with guns....hmmm...)  You say this as if it were surprising,  yet in fact a necessary consequence of libertarian philosophy.  All non-coersive functions should be dealt  with privately,  therefore it follows that the only functions remaining to the state are the coersive ones.  :Perhaps you have.  May I suggest that you consider that revolutionaries :frequently generate support by acting as protectors of \\\"geezers,\\\"  :mothers and children.  Governments that ignore such people on the grounds :that \\\"we don't have much to fear\\\" from them do so at their own peril.  Much more likely it's drunken teenagers.

In the unlikely event that you missed my earlier sarcasm,  let me say this directly: The idea that such programs as Social Security or AFDC should be considered \\\"defense\\\" (an idea which has been advanced in ths and other newsgroups) is so absurd a lie as to be unworthy of consideration.  Do you seriously dispute this?    I don't want to seem patronizing,  but you still seem to be laboring under the delusion that under a socialized economic system it is reasonably intelligent and honest persons (like yourself) who make the decisions. I feel any third party added to a transaction is every bit as likely to be ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller.  I don't expect you to agree with me,  but you explain why you feel I'm wrong? \",\" This sounds wonderful, but it seems no one either wants to spend time doing this, or they don't have the power to do so.

(I can hear it in my guitar amplifier, too...)\",\"A local dealer is advertising \\\"No negotiation necessary!\\\" Make you wonder... \",\"   The word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the \\\"B\\\" word, or the \\\"H\\\" word, or even the \\\"N\\\" or \\\"W\\\" words. It is the \\\"L\\\" word - LOSER !!   That's right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it is all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.   Remember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail buffer can claim they are \\\"too young\\\" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet. The eighties were about \\\"How America Learned to Win Once Again\\\". Then (wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win. No Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer (We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no holds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a few \\\"little\\\" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an S&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to contend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never had it so good.    In the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one doesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a \\\"kinder and gentler type of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of discourse about people who \\\"don't get it\\\". For those of us in the winning business, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no  suggestion of losing.   But what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our  \\\"white male\\\" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out  photojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one with a \\\"Hail Mary\\\" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'three yards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses in the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the  weapon of choice these days.     Who is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on  your face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This  is known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt  sure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the  same. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to  take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?   What we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is  the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood used to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott declaimed, \\\"Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will  not tolerate a loser.\\\" And so on.    The political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and Democrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some  \\\"equitable\\\" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a  loser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian homosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%)  minority.   Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most conservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't care who's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say something about make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition). In the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a  \\\"neoconservative\\\" or a \\\"neoliberal\\\" depending on how much you want to limit the pot.   Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be popular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still be popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I  would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it is the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any other place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in Columbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in the eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to  see more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious  preference, and sexual orientation.

Here is the scoring:  Pick 1st round winner, way off on games:  2 points Pick 1st round winner, within one game:   3 points Pick 1st round winner, pick # of games:   5 points  Pick 2nd round winner, way off on games:  3 points Pick 2nd round winner, within one game:   4 points Pick 2nd round winner, pick # of games:   6 points  Pick conference champ, way off on games:  5 points Pick conference champ, within one game:   6 points Pick conference champ, pick # of games:   9 points  Pick Stanley Cup champ, way off on games: 8 points Pick Stanley Cup champ, within one game:  10 points Pick Stanley Cup champ, pick # of games:  14 points Pick loser in 7, series goes 7:           2 points Pick loser in 7, series decided in Game 7, OT: 4 points (these last two are sympathy points, probably won't happen anyway)  Obviously, picking the Stanley Cup champion is important.  I will do some tests to see if the format is fair, but probably I will be too lazy to modify it, so the scoring will probably be like this.  As for entry forms, well, this post is getting too long, so see next post.   --     Keith Keller    LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!

We always came home with a nasty case of jiggers (large red bumps where the buggers had burrowed into the skin). My mother would paint the bumps with clear finger nail polish. This was repeated daily for about a week or so. The application of the polish is supposed to suffocate them as it seals of the skin. All I can say is it worked for us. One word of caution though. Putting finger nail polish on a jigger bite stings like hell.  (If I do get flamed for this just put jam in my pockets and call me toast.:) \",\"This probably is in a FAQ somewhere, but....
