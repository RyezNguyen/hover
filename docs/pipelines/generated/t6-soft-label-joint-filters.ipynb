And in the NHL, there exist these things called \\\"ties\\\".  A tie occurs when a game ends with the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie.  There also exits these things called \\\"wins\\\".  A win is when one team has a higher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other at a time, so I can say \\\"the opponent\\\".)  A team gets two points for a win.  So, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10 ties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The first team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86 points.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number of wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That's amazing.  So, Rex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then that's what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the tiebreaker and therefore have the \\\"better\\\" record, even though both teams had the same number of points.

This is an improved version anyway so no loss the first time.  HL}  The standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents  is probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, \\\"Hermeneutrik und  Kritik,\\\" _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of _Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Noerdlingen: Beck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The  Prophetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 (SLC:  Deseret Book, 1989). (If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibley describes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little knowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subject and the reader.)  Nibley's extract from Blass's work is in the form of \\\"rules for forgers.\\\"  It makes interesting reading.  I confess that I have not read Blass's work, only Nibley's extract thereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required and as far as I know there is no English translation available.  However, I believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that  any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one  would expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not  be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to  determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and  culture or is a later forgery.  Actually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:  1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For example the Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientific means to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found with them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual physical objects.  2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the copy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find a document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something from centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several generations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still  be tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannot expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so we must confine our testing to the text itself.  It is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if the document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date the document and identify its culture of origin.  For example I've heard of a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king in what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn up scholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the holograph).  They could check the language, content and writing style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a Palestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results were positive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually wrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but (barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for  comparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way to determine who the actual author was.  As I say, I'm no expert on Blas's work.  I do remember some of the tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.   Specifically we might ask:  1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradict itself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to  maintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The  longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency. For this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.  2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time? Again a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the writing is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be able to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuous things which someone from that culture would get right without even thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous  and trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.  3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speech etc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that  seem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book?   If so do they fit in with the culture?  Of course there are complications if the document has been translated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language when he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the culture claimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems and reduce certainty to be sure but don't necessarily prove forgery.  These tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work  with) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the  historian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to  ask are, \\\"Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we  know about the culture of claimed origin?\\\"  If there are things  which don't fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due to our lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really  significant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture.\",\" Well I can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the  significant drop in price year after year.

Yet it was done.  Done quite successfully for a number of years. *Somebody* thought it was worth the risk.          Your assumption is that this \\\"low\\\" dollar/pound area is sufficiently low as to make gun-running unprofitable.  On what do you base this?           And given that smuggling channels are already established, and given the economies of scale, would it really add significantly more expense to start smuggling firearms, especially considering doing so would be less hazardous (in terms of getting caught) than drugs?

And customs doesn't even have the extra advantage of being able to sniff them out.           I'd be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would be worth more than a shipload of raw ore, *and* you're virtually guaranteed to get it past customs, because they'd have to hand search every hold of every ship which came through.

The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be depressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damned thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just about (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working correctly is totally drop safe.  Now, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single documented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because he failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the proprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely prevented the office from getting shot.  The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire. This does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down intentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a 'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else. By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece. From the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of firing it.  The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that the firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the wide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be familiar with that particular type of firearm.\",\" [...]  (the date I have for this is 1-26-93)  note Clinton's statements about encryption in the 3rd paragraph..

Other countries have different names for loose equivalents; autostrada, autoroute, motorway etc.   Europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasn't passed as far as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than the US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred to the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things you really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more professional attitude to driving. You just never see two cars running parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.   You're wrong. GTI's  go this fast. Just kind of noisy, not the ideal  autobahn car.

Besides, the unique sound of a horn is more effective in attracting the attention of BDI cagers than is the sound of an engine, which is what they expect to hear (you are on the road!).  As is usually the case, a single anecdote hardly constitutes sound safety procedure.  The answer is 161.33 feet. \",\"Hi there!...   Well, i have a 386/40 with SVGA 1Mb.

That being said, I still think Baerga was VERY SLIGHTLY better last year, but I think this is as close to a wash as you're likely to find.  I personally don't care much for Alomar's defense.  I don't think he's nearly as good as people make him out to be, and he can't turn the DP to save his life.  He comes across the bag improperly, and his release is slow.  Considering the high leverage of the DP, this is a shortcoming I can't overlook.  In the long term, I'd move Alomar to another position.  If the Jays could trade a hot Devon White for something, I'll be Alomar could be a hell of a CF.  In the long run, I think I'd rather have Jeff Kent at 2B and Alomar in CF than Alomar/White.    \",\" The file that would be a problem is DBLSPACE.BIN, not .EXE.\",\"Vera Shanti Noyes writes;   Of course I believe in Predestination.  It's a very biblical doctrine as Romans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Church has always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free will.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also affected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and Jansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4).  For God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect, who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final perserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those without that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need it, as they had freely chosen hell.          ^^^^^^^^^^^ People who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own effort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined them to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were deserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and sinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.   Well, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some blessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little), for those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And those He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one or in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal punishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it (cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder were forgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I need not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement is quite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from the Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira, Jerusalem in 70 AD, etc.  not a >good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we not >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more  We should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the U.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am an isolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But in the case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily involved, it would not be a \\\"just war.\\\"  \\\"Blessed\\\" after all, \\\"are the peacemakers\\\" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Our actions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is unrelated to anything to justify it for us.\",\"  You apparently think you are some sort of one-man judge and jury who can declare \\\"total\\\" victory and then sit back and enjoy the applause.  But you've picked the wrong topic if you think a few rigged \\\"quotations\\\" can sustain the legend and lie of the Deir Yassin \\\"massacre.\\\"  You have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology. At the most basic level, you should know that there is a big difference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding \\\"quotations\\\" that support your preset opinions.  If you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that many of the sources of your \\\"quotations\\\" have an axe to grind, and therefore you must be very careful about whom you \\\"quote.\\\"  For example, Meir Pa'il, whom you cite, was indeed a general, a scholar, and a war hero.  But that doesn't mean everything that comes out of his mouth is gold.  In fact (and here your lack of experience shows), Pa'il is such a fanatic, embittered leftist that much of his anti-Israel blathering (forget about anti-Irgun blathering) would be considered something like treason in non-Israel contexts.  But of course you don't consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy \\\"quotation\\\" that you can use to attack Israel.  Benny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a \\\"scholar\\\" when he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don't be fooled. It's just the old Zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as an attack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely at the section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence, you will see his \\\"indictment\\\" to be pure hot air.  And this is the BEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning evidence.  Unfortunately for him, because his book parades itself as \\\"scholarly,\\\" he is forced to put footnotes.  So you can clearly see that his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing.  The Deir Yassin \\\"massacre\\\" never took place as the propagandists tell it, any more than the Sabra and Shatila \\\"massacres.\\\" Do you get the feeling people like to blame the Jews for \\\"massacres,\\\" even if they have to make them up?  It must sound spicy.  Even some Jews like to do it, for reasons of their own.  Please, don't confuse any of you Deir Yassin \\\"massacre\\\" stuff with facts or scholarship.  You should stick to Begin's version unless you find something serious to contradict it.\",\"The only ether I see here is the stuff you must have been breathing before you posted... \",\"Mark Singer brings up the Strawberry Incident, where he lost a homerun and the fan caught it.   Yes, I think he should have done more to get out of the way.  As much as fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winning the game is more important.  As a Dodger fan, he has to be aware that this is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win in any way possible.  As soon as the ball was hit that far, his first instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catch it himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.  I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against  visiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the field.  Now, this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or not.  Sure, he probably screwed up, but the fan should realize his first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win. \",\" At the company I worked for previously, I received a file that was des encryped and the person that had sent it, went on vaction.

As soon as you possibly can.  The difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally, any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in these kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  The remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from a wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (Occupational Safety and Health Service): \\\"Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and Rehabilitation: A Practitioner's Guide\\\".  First, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands): (note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)    RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries   OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI   CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI   WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI   CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)   Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.   Pronation: Turning the palm down.   Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.   Supination: Turning the palm up.   Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.   Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.   Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.   Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.   Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.   Abduction: Moving away from the body.   Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.  Now then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse conditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles, tendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt. Diffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle discomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of tenderness in muscles, although they're not necessarily \\\"the problem.\\\"  --- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theory.  Normally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which pass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict the blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power, you're completely restricting your blood flow.  Without fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out, then they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates nasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.  Once one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the load.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes things worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow, and the cycle continues.  Another by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from your nerves.  They need blood too.  Anyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a change for the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never relax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor ergonomics, only make things worse.  --- Specific injuries you may have heard of:  (note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute injuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)  Tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to cause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability to lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets inflamed, and you've got your problem.  Tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon can cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating, and can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more swelling, and more pain.  \\\"Sub-acute\\\" tendonitis is more common, which entails a dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse with repetitive activity.  Carpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include feeling \\\"pins and needles\\\", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation. CTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.  Adverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is where the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere. AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS  disorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy  (brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).  Others: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name for a way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS conditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors misdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you may have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion before somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).  ==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment  The most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce tension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax. If you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out the world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding principle in your work: every three minutes take a three second break. EVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every three minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings, calm down, and relax.  If you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and relaxation are really a big deal.  There are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce inflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad posture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen your muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold contrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's best for you.  --- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was written in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim from Appendix 10. -- dwallach]  . Let your shoulders relax. . Let your elbows swing free. . Keep your wrists straight. . Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward. . Keep the hollow in the base of your spine. . Try leaning back in the chair. . Don't slouch or slump forward. . Alter your posture from time to time. . Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.  Set the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There  should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees, and your thighs should not slope too much.  Now, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable to work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a footrest.  Now, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in the hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this area.  If you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning back, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.  [Now, I diverge a little from the text]  A good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair, go find a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle, back height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in the way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm rests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good store and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you. In the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend \\\"Just Chairs.\\\"  The name says it all.  --- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:  There is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some people, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you shouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your keyboard to be \\\"right there\\\".  If you drop your arms at your side and then lift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands when your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid pronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads may or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and look at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It's often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or deviated hands.  Some argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly designed.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.

This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory in a powerbook and a ci.   When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I was told by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would return the original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.)  I followed the instructions for returning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks.  Well, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which were ever returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me \\\"Why we never received your old chips.\\\"  I then explained I the procedure that I had followed to return them, to which the person replied \\\"You mean you sent them US Mail?\\\" (which I had, per the original sales person's instructions.)  I was told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that I should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly what I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were absolutely no help.  I sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attempted to trace the package through the US mail, made *many* more phone calls to TechWorks, all to no avail (I wouldn't give-up because I was so disgusted.) Sales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing I could do to pursuade them to \\\"make it right.\\\"  I finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, asking them to investigate the problem.   Three weeks later, the credit miraculously appeared on my statement.  I have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted with the service that I received from a company.  In all fairness, they had no way of knowing that was not trying to rip them off, but I went to *such* great lengths to prove to them that this really happened.  Oh well, c'est la vie.

They did some fine penely-killing in the first (2 men down for a couple of minutes at one point) but they just couldn't keep it  up.  They spent virtually the entire game either short-handed or just coming off a penelty -- as soon as they'd get re-grouped, they're penalized again!   Sheesh -- like Gilmour said after the 1st -- you can't go calling  every little push an shove in a game like that.  And if you're going to, you have to do it for both teams.   Pearson (one of my four favorite Leafs) played like a bonehead -- I saw him personally screw up at least 2 good scoring opportunities, and then he got that *bonehead* 5-minute major high-sticking penalty.   Cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand-full of games ago and he played a good game.  If the other players on his line can smarten up, that line should do okay.  Clark's got to get tough -- he's got to intimidate and go for the net.  Send Clark up the left  wing over the blue line a couple times... his patented wrist shot will put some numbers on the board... and Pearson... heck, maybe he should be benched.   I hate to repeat Grapes, but where the heck was Foligno?  Zezel can't do all the checking himself -- and get MacLlwain on the move... we  need some speed out there!  Keep Potvin in net, he did okay  considering... although (like I said a couple weeks ago) Potvin  messed up in a couple games in the AHL playoffs last year -- he can  easily do it again.   My prediction last week was Toronto in 7 -- that the games DET wins  will be blow-outs and the game TOR wins will be close -- I still stand by that.   Don't fret, Leafs fans, in order to win in 7, the other team has to win 3! :-)   Burns is going to make some magic -- he'll mix up some lines.  Match the Wings line-per-line.  He'll have his team checking hard, and he'll never let them get out-numbered in their own end.  The Leafs will win Wednesday night... and will take 1 or their home games (probably the first one).\",\"Hi,    I am trying to write an X-windows based interface that runs on top of GDB.

Lewis has taken a couple of pretty severe hits in this group lately. First somebody was accusing him of being self-righteous and unconvincing. Now we are told that we Christians should be embarrassed by him. (As well as by Josh McDowell, about whom I have no comment, having never read his work.)  Anyone who thinks that C. S. Lewis was self-righteous ought to read his introduction to The Problem of Pain, which is his theodicy. In it, he explains that he wanted to publish the book anonymously. Why? Although he believed in the argument he was presenting, he did not want to seem to presume to tell others how brave they should be in the face of their own suffering. He did not want people to think that he was presenting himself as some kind of model of fortitude, or that he was anything other than what he considered himself to be -- \\\"a great coward.\\\"   OFM has adequately handled the question of whether we ought to be embarrassed by Lewis' liar/lunatic/lord argument (which, by the way, is part of a *much* bigger discourse.) I would just like to add that, far from being embarrassed by Lewis, I am in a state of continual amazement at the soundness and clarity of the arguments he presents.   - Phil -\",\"With the continuin talk about the \\\"End of the Space Age\\\" and complaints  by government over the large cost, why not try something I read about  that might just work.

If you want to detect a 1kHz tone, set a switched-capacitor filter chip to that frequency, feed your input to it, and see if anything comes out the other end.  The NE567 was what you used when good clean bandpass filters were hard to do; nowadays they're easy, and the results are better.\",\"Secrecy in Clipper Chip  The serial number of the clipper chip is encrypted with the system key and transmitted as one part of a three part message.  Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the system key   2) Recieve Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number      is necessary for local operation).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large, making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.  IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number.\",\" Dear Defiant (or Unfaithful or Pixie):  I will take up the challenge to reply, as I am a theist.  The foundation for faith in God is reason, without which the existence of God could not be proven.  That His existence can be proven by reason is indisputable (cf. my short treatise, \\\"Traditional Proofs for the  Existence of God,\\\" and Summa Theologica).  Now, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason, I assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?  Because God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter, the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the Measure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order to the universe (logos).  I next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which is contrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And, since God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savior as early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5, God instructs that because a human (Adam) was first responsible for man's alienation from the Source of all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship. Thus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.  Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claim is true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.  You next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the United States Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will reply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned, and thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  For example, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton's head, he could have denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics must be obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true.   Therefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.  QED   --  boundary\",\" I don't buy this at all. Roy was the reason the game was tied... and that would *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool.  Hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ... Both Dionne's and Bellows' shots were misplayed by Hextall, but just because his gaffes were early in the game, no one seems to care. Roy stood on his head  for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from  end-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by  Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall  for most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero  because Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities.  Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very  well, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over  Bellows' stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all  those opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them. Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ...    Sure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against an explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.   I disagree. Roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole night.  The defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic, Nolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.   This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities, as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.   And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. Roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5, when you consider the defense, or lack of one, that played in front of him for most of the season.   The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans. Why should they read the papers? They played 58 minutes of \\\"Burnsian\\\" hockey to shut down Quebec. All they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the  extra 2.  Red Light to face Quebec...rubbish. That's a guaranteed way to end the series 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ? The fans, the media, and Racicot, perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team.   If you mean the goal should never have gone in, because there should never have been an OT, then I agree. But the goal itself was a great piece of work by Young. Roy had both the near and far posts covered, but Young flipped the puck up under Roy's arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all.\",\" Apple has patented their implementation of regions, which presumably includes the internal data structure (which has never been officially documented by Apple).  Apple cannot patent the concept of a region.  I'm guessing that either NuTek reverse-engineered Apple's internal data structure for regions (I dunno if this would hold up in court), or they came up with their own data structure.  If it's the latter, then they won't be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files, there aren't many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTime movies, perhaps?)  As long as the region isn't being stored on disk and transferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it doesn't matter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure.  I remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware, and that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port.

This summarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300 participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in Seville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).  OLYMPUS has been particularly useful : -      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of        new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small        antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested        data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,        distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few        examples.  -      in opening the door to new telecommunications services        which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-        frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over        Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.  -      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS        received for the first time in Europe, over several months,        high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and        then distributed it to various centres in Europe.  When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the world's largest telecommunications satellite; and no other satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.  OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some of the world's largest businesses. Access to the satellite is given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or services; over the past four years some 200 companies and organisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over 100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning organisation.    As the new technologies and services tested by these OLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then make use of operational satellites such as those of EUTELSAT.\",\"pwhite@empros.com (Peter White) relates a story about a person who  gives a message in tongues which consists entirely of the words pu' ka.

The magnitude of such accelerations he estimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not be a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published in 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very long-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in fact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of course. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration? Can this be extended to larger accelerations?\",\"Hi.

In fact, be- fore BATSE, having this widely separated \\\"Interplanetary Network\\\" was the only sure way to locate a random burst.  With only one detector, one cannot locate a burst (except to say \\\"It's somewhere in the field of view.\\\").  With two detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.  With three detectors, one gets intersecting annuli, giving two possible locations.  If one of these locations is impossible (because, say, the Earth blocked that part of the  sky), voila, you have an error box.  BATSE, by having 8 detectors of its own, can do its own location determination, but only to within about 3 degrees (would someone at GSFC, like David, like to comment on the current state of location determination?).  Having inde- pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty.  You did touch on something that you didn't mean to, though.  Some believe (in a reference that I have somewhere) that absorption-like features seen in a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector.

Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian without neglecting the need for scientific rigor.   (Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing will be discussed at the beginning - Note: I've set all followups to sci.med since most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I'm sure most of the replies, if any, will be med-related.)     They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS). Oops, that is not a recognized \\\"illness\\\" in the psychological community, better not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)  Actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system, just e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general population, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among physicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage - any help here a.p.p.er's?)  One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious choleric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to control, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are also extroverted, they are best described as \\\"Field Marshalls\\\".  This trait is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to lead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge, to raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically- minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However, when the NT person has self-image challenges, the \\\"dark-side\\\" of this personality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.  A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling), and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've known many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them with a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).  Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)  Enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.    You've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being the phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent.    In my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune stressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged. I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the details), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this diagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal therapy below).   The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being considered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween infection.    I was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after my blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then dropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received zinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular specialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal, he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin) supplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene. Call me carrot face.  :^)  Hopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to all supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for example, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had good information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.    Though I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my sinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that demonstrate candida \\\"blooms\\\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation (sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on Sporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered normal).  BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious) aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion.    My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic response to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive. Another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow part-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a  threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post, one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a  Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.  BTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \\\"Sinus Survival\\\", has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic anti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over 90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it doesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection is not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that nystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.  This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit, lots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who has to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.    This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the appropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture the yeast \\\"bloom\\\" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.  It's a real Catch-22.  Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that no studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not up to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which should not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should be done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets, you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get funding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the smaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other doctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get nowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.  It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have *decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable hypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue -  excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will not, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...    Aren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia?    Again, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus species can grow hyphae (\\\"roots\\\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing in bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but you can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has been pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in e-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long- term treatment of GI tract \\\"candidiasis\\\".  It's like trying to weed a garden by cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away.  The $60000 question is whether a contained candida \\\"bloom\\\" can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \\\"systemic\\\" in the classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal.    Also, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a prior post, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)    As I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work. For example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention surgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and fairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and equalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly improved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated. Of course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have improved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to \\\"live with it\\\".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total \\\"cure\\\".  The anti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those having sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above. Be sure to get the revised edition.)    Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his visits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said \\\"you'll just have to live with it\\\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and non-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road to recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti- \\\"yeast hypothesis\\\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as, \\\"it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\\\", to put it mildly. I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient.  Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \\\"hypothetical yeast overgrowth\\\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people have identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues have been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things - you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice? Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with \\\"scientific correctness\\\" that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which we don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach (such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having exhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I went to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment, and as a result I have found significant relief.  Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having his license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt) therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me: \\\"well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority to use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I can't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State Board.\\\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic reasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the patient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine, and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything it can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of which seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all (true quackery).

Scientific models are a game to play, and are only as good as the assumptions and measurements (if any) that go into them.  As an example, I remember when nuclear winter was the big hype in atmospheric science.  It wasn't long after Sagan's admonitions that one of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model of the nuclear winter scenario at ERL in Boulder.  He decided to assume that the atmosphere is more like a two-dimensional thing, than a one- dimensional thing.  He also assumed that it rained and that the winds blow in the real atmosphere.  On returning to Georgia Tech, he showed a transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they were generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlation between the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remoteness from reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagan's model showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model  in sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to our boy's model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in the winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer. He predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry, the biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would probably see even less cooling.  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even less than a nuclear autumn, one might say, to a nuclear fizzle.  To quote from H.S. Yoder,   The postulated models have become accepted as the reality  instead of the lattice of assumptions they are.

Yes, I understand the issues.  I don't even particularly care for the idea.  But am I the only one that finds the sort of overreaction above just a *little* questionable?  You must find things like the Moon *really* obnoxious in their pollution.  A few questions for those frothing at the mouth to ask themselves:   1) How long is this thing supposed to stay up?  Sounds like it would have a *huge* drag area, not a lot of mass, and be in a fairly low orbit.   2) Just what orbital parameters are we talking about here? What real impact are we talking about, really?  How many optical astronomers are *really* going to be impacted?   3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of 'seeing' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data the sensors are supposed to return along with the data for large inflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)? The choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising is being used to help fund this thing.   4) If your answer to 3) above was \\\"the astronomers\\\", then feel free to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more important research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.  In other words, put up or shut up.   Probably so.  I'm just not sure we agree about who the 'stupid' are.

I inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  I can stick it in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  I'm not fat, just have a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch to get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it still hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and   muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent  irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep,  wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the puncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the  spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot, and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 \\\" apart.)  This is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.

Since it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicy:pointer, I suggest you set colormapFocusPolicy:pointer also.  That way, the cmap focus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus, but will beat its own path.

I wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences between PHIGS and PEXlib (it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out pretty soon).  But here's a brief summary...  PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many devices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and take advantage of a 3D extension to X called \\\"PEX\\\".  PEXlib is a slightly \\\"lower\\\" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX extension to X.  Some advantages of using PEXlib... - Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS - Provides immediate mode capabilities - Is free of \\\"policy\\\" - PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support   features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).   PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.  Some advantages of using PHIGS... - Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones - Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output - PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier - PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you - PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.  If you're working strictly in X and don't care about things like archiving, I would go with PEXlib.  Either way, you will find that both API's have a lot in common.\",\"FYI:  The actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an HP deskjet is 1/600th inch.  The electronics and dynamics of the ink cartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch. On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.  The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer results in much less spread than ink drop technology.  It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than inexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printers offer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1 ppm for an ink jet printer.  Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the life of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about $US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield) cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over the life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are less than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closer between the two technologies.

WHy did the FBI not announce \\\"this window,     blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come     down\\\", and maintain a left to right sequence?    b)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when     mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)     suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to     brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long     exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend     to ignite.     What other chemicals come up in the forensics?    Who else will be allowed to test the site?    c)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation     rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made     to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature     above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain     heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length     of time (start a wall fire and wait).     Check your military records; look at the tapes.    Why were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),    tear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why    the hurry. was there still a comm channel open    to the outside?).     Do you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the    compound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which ones    are missing?   Do I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not.  You trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement?   IN advance of a Court?  God help us.    (For we are surely not helping ourselves).  You trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate?    You are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting.   Look again.   Did it happen that way?  I do not know.  I was not there.   AND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO DECIDE.  But will that happen?  89 people will NOT have the chance   to tell their side as the BATF leader was, on camera.  No one wins.  Except:  more force next time.   Listen to your hearts, people.  Thanx again Stephen.  roy andrew crabtree\",\"Hello.   I just read my first newspaper in a while and noticed an article on a 'messianic cult' leader named 'David Koresh'.  I'd like to know more about this and what is going on with them.  Please email me as I don't normally read this newsgroup.  Thanks. \",\"  (just an interrupting comment here) Since EARLY 1980's , israelis said they are  willing to give up the Adminstration rule of the occupied terretories to Palestineans. Palestineans refused and will refuse such settlement that denies them their right of SELF-DETERMINATION. period.   Ok. I donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations. However, i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who have the right for it.  As for the Arabian and Palestinean voices that are against the current negotiations and the so-called peace process, they are not against peace per se, but rather for their well-founded predictions that Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank (and most probably the same for Golan Heights) back to the Arabs. An 18 months of \\\"negotiations\\\" in Madrid, and Washington proved these predictions. Now many will jump on me saying why are you blaming israelis for no-result negotiations. I would say why would the Arabs stall the negotiations, what do they have to loose ?  Arabs feel that the current \\\"negotiations\\\" is ONLY for legitimizing the current status-quo and for opening the doors of the Arab markets for israeli trade and \\\"oranges\\\". That is simply unacceptable and would be revoked.   Just an opinion.\",\"  The latest news I saw was that two of the eight known survivors (not NO SURVIVORS!!! as you so rudely put in all caps) said they started the fire.  I won't go on with the things the wacko of Waco did. \",\"  I heard he had asked the FBI to provide him with a word processor.  Does anyone know if Koresh has requested that it be WordPerfect5.0?  WP5.0 was written (and is owned) by Mormons, so the theological implications of requesting (or refusing) WP5.0 are profound!\",\" WFWG does use NDIS but it cooperates well with the NDIS shim for ODI. (I've heard that it is as fast as NDIS direct)                               The additional TSR load is minimal.  I think I eat another  20K total. This is worth it to me since it allows me to get to my Windows NT  box.  Novell hasn't released a decent NT Novell client yet so I share through my WFWG box.         \",\"  ------------ Part 10 of 14 ------------ M:J\\\"U$$,^UM[>WE/M[>V+BXN+BXN+BXN+BXOM[>U34U-34[\\\"PL!D9<7'2TM+2 M/3T]/3T]F9F9`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`$!`0&$`0%XGG5UP,#`P%M;%*JJJFMK\\\"0G/S\\\\_/SPD)-C9N MV=E&!UDS4G9V4I5960<'$=G9V=G9V=EN;FYN;FYN;F[9V=EA86%A!05L;&QL M!04%>7F3DV-CDY.3DY-C555555555555555L;&QL$A(2$A(2;&QL556TM!$1 M[NXV-C8)J@F`\\\"6L\\\";MD1$3,S4G83$W924I4S,S,S$1$163,SE5)V=G9V4@$!

Lack of belief in YOUR god does NOT imply atheism. Just because some moslems aren't moral does not mean they don't believe in a god named Allah, although their Allah may not do the things your Allah does. If a moslem says he/she believes that a god exists, he/she is a theist (though maybe not a TRUE follower of islam).    Jerk. \",\" Dr. cheghadr bA namakand!

For about six weeks, I've been suffering on pains in my left head side, the left leg and sometimes the left  arm. I made many tests (e.g. computer tomography, negative, lyme borreliosis, negative, all electrolytes in the blood in their correct range), they're all o.K., so I should be healthy. As a matter of fact, I am not feeling so. I was also at a Neurologist's too, he considered me healthy too.  The blood tests have shown that I have little too much of Hemoglobin (17.5, common range is 14 to 17, I unfortunately do not know about the units). Could these hemi-sided pains be the result of this or of a also possible block of the neck muscles ?  I have no fever, and I am not feeling entirely sick, but neither entirely  healthy.   Please answer by direct email on <ghilardi@urz.unibas.ch>  Thanks for every hint\",\"  Very sensible.     Must you rave so? Fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government engaged in  disgusting cowardly massacres of Azeri women and children. I am really sorry if that fact bothers you.    More ridicule, I take it? Still not addressing the original points made.   Then what seems to be the problem? Did you ever read newspaper at all?   \\\"PAINFUL SEARCH ..\\\"  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \\\"Hojali Disaster\\\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \\\"We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\\\" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. \\\"We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.\\\"  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. \\\"Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\\\" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. \\\"This  is just a small percentage of the dead,\\\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. \\\"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.\\\"  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  \\\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\\\" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  \\\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.\\\"  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.  THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92   HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES  AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.  \\\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\\\" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. \\\"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive.\\\"  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  \\\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  \\\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother.  \\\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\\\" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \\\"We have never got any of the bodies back.\\\"  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  \\\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\\\" Mr Sadikov said. \\\"I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock.\\\"  Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

However the Q700 upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21\\\" with 8 bit depth and up to 16\\\" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It also has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.

The trouble with regulations is  that they only tell you what you are no longer permitted to do, not what  you should do instead.       I think the cause of the new regulations is the Montreal Protocol  which has a definite CFC-phase-out schedule.  (Of course the cause of  the Montreal Protocol was all the research done on the causes of the  Ozone Depletion Problem.)       Someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast  to ban the ozone-depleting (CFC) chemicals and not gasolines and other  greenhouse-gas-producing compounds.  The greenhouse effect (produced by  infrared-trapping gasses like CO2 and methane) and the ozone-hole problem  (produced by long-lived, chlorine-containing molecules) are not the same  thing.  It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's  (chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which  are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms.  Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help  the greenhouse-gas problem, but would do nothing for the ozone problem.   Fred W.

Xt Glossary ----------------------------------------------------------------------  o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code   to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with   this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,   RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,   etc.  The terms \\\"Xt\\\" and \\\"Intrinsics\\\" are used interchangeably,   however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X   window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,   Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the   Intrinsics are not especially useful.  o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The   precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It   is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the   Object class although these are more accurately called windowless   widgets or gadgets.  o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below   the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib   functions because Xt provides most such services although an   understanding of Xlib helps with problems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  In brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for critical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the appropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a list traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.  The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the interrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous to add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never be called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop about the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal. However, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.  Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.          Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4.  How do I use a different visual than the default? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has three things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and border pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap resource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions deals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen and DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is not properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is created.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends on the visual being used.    How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier because the basic information you need is available.  The first is a little harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the needed information.  /*  * Some sample code to start up an application using something other  * than the default visual.  *  * To compile:  * cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm  *  * To run:  * ./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow  *  * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap  * to install.  */  #include <X11/Intrinsic.h> #include <X11/StringDefs.h> #include <X11/Shell.h>  typedef struct {  Visual *visual;  int depth; } OptionsRec;  OptionsRec Options;  XtResource resources[] = {  {\\\"visual\\\", \\\"Visual\\\", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *),  XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL},  {\\\"depth\\\", \\\"Depth\\\", XtRInt, sizeof (int),  XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL}, };  XrmOptionDescRec Desc[] = {  {\\\"-visual\\\", \\\"*visual\\\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL},  {\\\"-depth\\\", \\\"*depth\\\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL} };    int main (argc, argv)  int  argc;  char  **argv; {  XtAppContext app;  /* the application context */  Widget  top;  /* toplevel widget */  Display  *dpy;  /* display */  char  **xargv; /* saved argument vector */  int  xargc;  /* saved argument count */  Colormap colormap; /* created colormap */  XVisualInfo vinfo;  /* template for find visual */  XVisualInfo *vinfo_list; /* returned list of visuals */  int  count;  /* number of matchs (only 1?) */  Arg  args[10];  Cardinal cnt;  char  *name = \\\"test\\\";  char  *class = \\\"Test\\\";   /*   * save the command line arguments   */   xargc = argc;  xargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *));  bcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));   /*   * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can   * retrieve the appropriate visual resource.   */  cnt = 0;  top = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv,           (String *) NULL, args, cnt);  dpy = XtDisplay (top);  cnt = 0;  XtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources,        XtNumber (resources),        args, cnt);  cnt = 0;  if (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top)))  {   XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt;   /*    * Now we create an appropriate colormap.  We could    * use a default colormap based on the class of the    * visual; we could examine some property on the    * rootwindow to find the right colormap; we could    * do all sorts of things...    */   colormap = XCreateColormap (dpy,          RootWindowOfScreen (XtScreen (top)),          Options.visual,          AllocNone);   XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNcolormap, colormap); ++cnt;    /*    * Now find some information about the visual.    */   vinfo.visualid = XVisualIDFromVisual (Options.visual);   vinfo_list = XGetVisualInfo (dpy, VisualIDMask, &vinfo, &count);   if (vinfo_list && count > 0)   {    XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNdepth, vinfo_list[0].depth);    ++cnt;    XFree ((XPointer) vinfo_list);   }  }  XtDestroyWidget (top);    /*   * Now create the real toplevel widget.   */  XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNargv, xargv); ++cnt;  XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNargc, xargc); ++cnt;  top = XtAppCreateShell ((char *) NULL, class,     applicationShellWidgetClass,     dpy, args, cnt);   /*   * Display the application and loop handling all events.   */  XtRealizeWidget (top);  XtAppMainLoop (app);  return (0); }  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 5.  Which visual should an application use? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to be specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your application probably falls into the category of always using the default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular visual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some such).  Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server allocates resources I may not always want your application to run in TrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may be very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor or just monochrome.  As an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different possible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static color, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above  plus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that shell.  A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have its own realize method to use the visual when it calls XCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be obtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A reasonable value is probably XtNvisual.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This is interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen() and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e. it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.  If the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies colormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the visual.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This was especially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  See section 2.8 of the Xt specification.  It eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The Intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed. It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any pending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned up before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then performed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have completed, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the list is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among other things.  As some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the Intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the widgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs immediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not destroyed until returning to the outer event loop.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting an application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget may not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open sockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):    Widget  ToplevelGet (gw)   Widget  gw;  /* widget to find toplevel */  {   Widget  top;    for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))    /* empty */;   return (top);  }   void  ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)   Widget  gw;  /* widget */   XtPointer closure; /* data the app specified */   XtPointer call_data; /* widget specific data */  {   Widget  toplevel;    toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);   XtUnmapWidget (toplevel); /* make it disappear quickly */   XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);   exit (0);  }  One can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying the toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never occur.    This works for most widgets and most applications but will not work for those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant of the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the widget may change and someday require that some external state is cleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.  One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and difficult to maintain practices.  Try the following code instead.   #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>   extern Widget ToplevelGet (  #if NeedFunctionPrototypes   Widget  gw  #endif  );   extern Boolean ExitWorkProc (  #if NeedFunctionPrototypes   XtPointer closure  #endif  );   extern void ExitCallback (  #if NeedFunctionPrototypes   Widget  gw,   XtPointer closure,   XtPointer call_data  #endif  );   Widget  ToplevelGet (gw)  Widget  gw;  /* widget to find toplevel */  {   Widget  top;    for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))    /* empty */;   return (top);  }    void  ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)  Widget  gw;  /* widget */  XtPointer closure; /* data the app specified */  XtPointer call_data; /* widget specific data */  {   Widget  toplevel;    toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);   XtUnmapWidget (toplevel); /* make it disappear quickly */   XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);   XtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),       ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);  }   Boolean  ExitWorkProc (closure)   XtPointer closure;  {   exit (0);   /*NOTREACHED*/  }   ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the application is next idle -- which happens after all the events are processed and the destroy callbacks are executed.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. How do I resize a Shell widget? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  After it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper thing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget using XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the Shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the request.  However, the Shell must have the resource XtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the window manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.  To change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not the child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  It does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does not fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not block, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to block.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For a file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF -- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to be read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based OS's it is the poll() system call.  How to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use another process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe to connect the application with this other process and pass the file descriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on BSD systems is \\\"tail -f filename\\\".  It's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_ reliable.  In particular:   - IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while    (several thousand times) and then stop until some other    event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race    condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.   - Pyramid, doesn't work at all.   - Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as    sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing    side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it    all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at    a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks    (get raound it by detecting the situation and having    select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had    been given the whole block).   Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as read(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and may not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with part of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this point I don't know.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  I have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full details of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already familiar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may not find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, which means its a 1000 pages.  Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., \\\"X Window System Toolkit, The  Complete Programmer's Guide and Specification\\\", Digital Press,  1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by  Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC  Direct at 1-800-DIGITAL.  The other book I commonly recomend to novices is:  Young, Doug. \\\"The X Window System: Applications and Programming with  Xt (Motif Version),\\\" Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8).  (ISBN 0-13-972167-3)  And of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt. O'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt reference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively overhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding it very useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related information.  I read two periodicals, \\\"The X Resource\\\" and the \\\"The X Journal\\\". These are the only two dealing specifically with X.  \\\"The X Resource\\\" is published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being the MIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no advertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  For orders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorial matters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted at math.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in ~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.   \\\"The X Journal\\\" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising. The articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical audience.  I read it more to see what's going on then with an expectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a fairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty good collection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call (908) 563-9033.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 14. What Widgets are available? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  There are three popular widget sets:  Athena - The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most    purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is    available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z. Motif - From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on    many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but    Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think    it is poorly implemented. OLIT - The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets    implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by    AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.    I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.  In addition the following collection of widgets are also available:  Xtra - a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software    Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked    bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,    spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen    them so I can't comment. FWF - The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of    freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,    FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets    can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine    a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z. Xcu - The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the    early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for    buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so    widely used. Xs - The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but    seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise. Xw - The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written    for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.    Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.    The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was    originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided    much experience for the designers of Xt. Xo - A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you    can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*  The following specialized widgets are also available:  Tbl - Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif    widgets as children.  Part of Wcl. Plots - The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).    Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there? ----------------------------------------------------------------------   __________________________________________  Name  Language Vendor  __________________________________________  Xview  C  Sun  OI  C++  ParcPlace  Interviews C++  Stanford  Tcl/tk  C  sprite.berkeley.edu  __________________________________________   However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and implementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop in the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language other than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  First, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)  typdef struct  {       String name;      long value;  } Arg;  and the code:  Arg arg;   XtSetArg (arg, \\\"name\\\", 3.2)  expands to  Arg arg;   arg.name = \\\"name\\\";  arg.value = 3.2;  you can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value gets the integer \\\"3\\\" instead of the floating point value \\\"3.2\\\".  When the value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is wildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So, how to get around this?  The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now recomending it over the previous suggestions.  #define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\\\     if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\\\         XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\\\     } else { \\\\         XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\\\         XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\\\     }   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. How do I write a resource converter? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Courtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):  The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5) Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow for destructors and caching of converted values.  There are several main types of resource converters:      string to data type     data type to string     data type to data type  i) string to data type     Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings     that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often     used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:   Name  Value  \\\"True\\\"  1  \\\"False\\\"  0      In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare     the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most     readily accomplished by the use of the \\\"quark\\\" mechanism of the     resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,     which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a     single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the     quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.      If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many     converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then     a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the     resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of     these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks     and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one     of the converters.  ii) data type to string     This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data     type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,     the data type value is simply converted to a string value,     probably by the use of sprintf.      Data type to string converters are useful for applications that     wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that     they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This     mechanism can be used to provide a \\\"snapshot\\\" of application state     into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to     a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.      If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type     converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to     string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure     that they are consistent.  iii) data type to data type     This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type     value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be     converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for     red, green and blue.   The type signature for a resource converter is as follows:  typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,  XrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);     Display *dpy;     XrmValuePtr args;     Cardinal *num_args;     XrmValuePtr fromVal;     XrmValuePtr toVal;     XtPointer *converter_data;  When the converter is invoked, the \\\"fromVal\\\" argument points to the source X resource manager value and the \\\"toVal\\\" argument points to the destination X resource manager value.  The \\\"converter_data\\\" argument is an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified when the converter is registered.  The \\\"args\\\" and \\\"num_args\\\" arguments allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is invoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the Pixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.  Care must be taken with the \\\"toVal\\\" argument.  An XrmValue has the following type definition and specifies a size and location for a converted value:  typedef struct {     unsigned int    size;     caddr_t         addr; } XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;  When the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of the given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL. In the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the destination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If the destination area is not large enough, then the converter should set the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the converter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply copy the converted value into the space given and return True.  If the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to the address of a static variable containing the converted value and return True.  When writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it becomes convenient to define a macro:      #define DONE(var, type) \\\\       if (toVal->addr) \\\\  { \\\\    if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\\      { \\\\        toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\        return False; \\\\      } \\\\    else \\\\      *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\\  } \\\\       else \\\\  toVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\\\       toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\       return True;      #define DONESTR(str) \\\\       if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\\  { \\\\    toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\    return False; \\\\  } \\\\       else \\\\  toVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\\\       toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\       return True;  Inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety checking on the \\\"num_args\\\" and \\\"args\\\" arguments to ensure that your converter is being called properly.  Once you have written your converter, you need to register it with the Intrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.  To register a converter with a single application context, use XtAppSetTypeConverter:  void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,  cache, destructor)     XtAppContext context;     String from;     String to;     XtTypeConverter converter;     XtConvertArgList args;     Cardinal num_args;     XtCacheType cache;     XtDestructor destructor;  To register a converter with all application contexts, use XtSetTypeConverter:  void XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,  cache, destructor)     String from;     String to;     XtTypeConverter converter;     XtConvertArgList args;     Cardinal num_args;     XtCacheType cache;     XtDestructor destructor;  In the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and XtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter and XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be used.  When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a \\\"cache\\\" argument specifies how converted resource values are to be cached:      XtCacheNone  Don't cache any converted values     XtCacheAll  Cache all converted values     XtCacheByDisplay Cache converted values on a per display basis  Caching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a good idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).  The \\\"destructor\\\" argument is a routine that is invoked then the resource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is being destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:  typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,  XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);     XtAppContext context;     XrmValuePtr to;     XtPointer converter_data;     XrmValuePtr args;     Cardinal *num_args;  The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated with the \\\"to\\\" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed to by the \\\"to\\\" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the conversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments for the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to free the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private data passed in when the converter was registered.  Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT R5 distribution:      mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c     contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c     contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. How do I open multiple displays? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  See \\\"Multi-user Application Software Using Xt\\\", The X Resource, Issue 3, (Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues involved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a nutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_ application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display and remove it from the application context.  The real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can happen 3 ways:  1. User selects a \\\"quit\\\" button on one of the displays,  2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,  3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,     server shutdown/crash, or network failure.  I'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a problem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that display.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.  The third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the Oliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult problem.  The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O error is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true for a single display X based application, but not true for a multiple display program or an application that does things other than display information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the I/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit() happens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid returning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment demonstrates this:  #include <setjmp.h> jmp_buf XIOrecover;  void XIOHandler (dpy)  Display  *dpy; {  destroyDisplay (dpy);  longjmp (XIOrecover, 1); }  main () {  ...  if (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)   XSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);  XtAppMainLoop (app_context); }  The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go back to the application specific data and perform any necessary cleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().  For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is first called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the jmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to the same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value of this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to longjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this purpose it is adequate.  Some other problems you might run into are resource converters that improperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors such as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical value.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to connect to a display.  There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in November of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically said this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 19. What changed from R3 to R4 to R5? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This addresses only changes in the Intrinsics.  First, the general changes for each release are described.  Then a, certainly incomplete, list of new functions added and others that are now deprecated are listed.  Brevity is a primary goal.

Where are the resources loaded from? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places (from highest priority to lowest priority):   1. Args passed at creation time.  2. Command line arguments.  3. User's per host defaults file  4. User's defaults file.  5. User's per application default file.  6. System wide per application default file.  Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result of steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.  The per host defaults file contains customizations for all applications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either specified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.  The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program \\\"xrdb\\\" is used to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the display must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is reasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER but most do not.  A user may have many per application default files containing customizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.  The system wide per application default files are typically found in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the fallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.  [Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]  You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.  Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located):   setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N  The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see XtResolvePathname()):   %N The value of the filename parameter, or the   application's class name.  %T The value of the file \\\"type\\\".  In this case, the   literal string \\\"app-defaults\\\"  %C customization resource (R5 only)  %S Suffix.  None for app-defaults.  %L Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \\\"ja_JP.EUC\\\")  %l Language part of %L  (e.g. \\\"ja\\\")  %t The territory part of the display's language string  %c The codeset part of the display's language string  Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is \\\"Myterm\\\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm  $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm  As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.  Let's consider another example. This time, let's set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.   setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N  The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,       for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is       defined so %T and %S are useless.  With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization resource value.  For example, you might run the \\\"myterm\\\" application like this:   myterm -xrm \\\"*customization: -color\\\"  If one of your pathname specifications had the value \\\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C\\\" then the expanded pathname would be \\\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\\\" because the %C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource.  The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:    /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N  (Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings.)  The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is     <root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   <root>/%L/%N:\\\\   <root>/%l/%N:\\\\   <root>/%N:  <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.  Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to \\\".\\\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \\\"./\\\", a dot followed by a slash.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. What order are callbacks executed in? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)  The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to modify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one currently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot guarantee the order of execution.  The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have; therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the list.  Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback    \\\"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the   procedure is to be appended.\\\"   you may not infer from the word \\\"appended\\\" that the callback routines are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback list.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 22. How do I know if a widget is visible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)   Right, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a \\\"deficiency\\\" in the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the protocol.  (The \\\"deficiency\\\" is that the information is available in one way, in this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section carefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.  A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from viewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped; that is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency. Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol; see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.   You'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.   As an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action routine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget which contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the map_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are suggestions.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  You can't.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc() tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is handled something like:   ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))  if (!ptr)  {   perror (\\\"malloc in xyzzy()\\\");   exit (1)  } To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions XtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which all use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and realloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.  In addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses XtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:   if (!ptr)   ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));  else   ptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));  ++count;  to be written as:   ptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);  Also, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I've found the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'm allocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so I can fully recover from not enough memory errors.  XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a structure or copying a string:     struct abc *xyzzy;    char      *ptr;    char      *str = \\\"abcdef\\\";     xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc); /* takes care of type casting */    ptr = XtNewString (str);  A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with malloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:    char       *ptr;    ptr = XtMalloc (100);   /* ... */   free (ptr);  may not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did this broken and complain to the vendor.  A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string when they should really be using XmStringFree().  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. How to debug an Xt application? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First, I'd recomend getting \\\"purify\\\" from Pure Software.  This is a great package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey at $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb (contact support@pure.com for more info).   Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into  the object code produced by existing compilers.  These  instructions check every memory read and write performed by  the program under test and detect several types of access  errors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past  malloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts  checking logic into all of the code in a program, including  third party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies  system call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory  usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel  adaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly  comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program  down typically by a factor of two to five.  An alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on many Unix's and has pretty similar features is \\\"The SENTINEL Debugging Environment\\\".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library functions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com for more info)  Next, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run in synchronous mode, easily accomplished with the \\\"-sync\\\" command line argument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then set a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the original Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous mode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to Xlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the server are asynchronous.  Next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the undocumented resource \\\"xtIdentifyWindows\\\" or the class resource \\\"XtDebug\\\" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window. For example:      example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &     example% xwininfo -tree       <click in new xload window>  will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each window is included.  This can help for checking the location and size of errant widgets.  Next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to test the way a widget manages it's children, you can try export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour of both.  It's a very clever idea.  The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from a pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to go to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands. Unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to your application which is stopped.  The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on your desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment) on one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly using a command sequence like this:   othermachine% xhost +thismachine  thismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;  thismachine% gdb application # Your favorite debugger.  or this:  othermachine% xhost +thismachine  thismachine% gdb application  (gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0  (gdb) run ...  I believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method of dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to release any grabs during breakpoints.  Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and knowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing the internals of a particular widget but not very far without understanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great deal.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work? ----------------------------------------------------------------------    I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,    XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when    I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.    I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works    perfect, but in my \\\"real\\\" application nothing happens.   The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those routines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is they use a default application context different then the one you may have created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per application context basis and you are using two application contexts, you won't get those events.  For example:   ...  cnt = 0;  toplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,        Desc, XtNumber (Desc),        &argc, argv,        Fallback, args, cnt);   XtAddTimeOut (...)  XtAddWorkProc (...)   XtAppMainLoop (app)  would never invoke the timeout.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)  Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an ``intuitive'' fashion.  Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has supported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with each other, and so far as I know, they are not published.  I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public protocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to support a \\\"standard\\\" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop and contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long as it is based on Xt).  The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM conventions, for more details read the code.  I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that it works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif anyway.  The latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from netcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.

If this were so, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide would be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in cities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show a higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this not to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks (which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants), the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the proportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.  What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on the part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended to show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave physical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the head neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this pattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.

Actually, I'm not fond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and Americans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic differences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I don't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent crime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every law-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.  On the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more culturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive, seven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates of Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities with roughly the same population, urban economy, geography and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.  In Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After a 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed weapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.  In Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason to purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted. Recreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are regulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a restricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box. In short, gun control but not unreasonably so.  Both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for gun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers studied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated), burglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from 1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same standard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.  Results: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver (1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99). 18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in Vancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 / 1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher (1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by weapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged. Although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were far more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.  Over the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle (11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000). After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations, the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as compared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.  When homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate of homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in Seattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver. Virtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns accounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns were 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than in Vancouver.  The authors of the report also investigated \\\"legally justifiable\\\" homicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during the seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only 21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in Seattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After excluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these earlier findings.  -------  This is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the argument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because Vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times that of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports annual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC, Chicago, Los Angeles and Houston.  Critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a gun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently. If the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to be higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study interval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns was not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that few would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.  As well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding citizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did experience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these cases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities during the course of the study period.  And, as was reported, Seattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category over Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for self-defense.

Here are the highlights:       R    H   E                  Oakland  2    9   0       Detroit            3    7   1  Chad Krueter scored Skeeter Barnes from 1st with an RBI double in the  bottom of the ninth against none other than Dennis Eckersley to give the Tigers the victory.  Barnes also had an RBI single to score Thurmond to tie the score in the ninth, also off Eckersley (sp?).  The A's got their runs on an RBI single by McGwire in the 1st and a solo homer by Reuben Sierra in the 6th.  Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the 7th for the other Tiger run.  John Doherty pitched another strong game for the Tigers, once again lasting through the seventh inning.  He was relieved by Bolton and then David Haas in the 8th, and Haas got the win.  Bobby Witt started for the A's, and was replaced by Honeycutt in the 6th, followed by Goose Gossage in the 8th, and finally Eckersly in the 9th.  Doherty gave up both of the A's runs, while Witt gave up the first Tiger run and Eckerseley gave up the last two.  In the post game interview (on WJR radio in Detroit), Sparky Anderson said its one of the few times he's gotten emotional in his managing career.  It was a big moment for him, and I'm sure all of us Tiger fans are unanimously very happy for him.  And what a way to get number 2,000!.

No, gravity is an inherent system.  You don't need any excess information other than observations to determine anything.  It is possible to objectively determine someone's guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system. I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state that everything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean that it cannot be objective in theory.   Perhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  Anyway, as I noted before, the practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likely the only ones to be considered \\\"immoral\\\" under the previous \\\"definitions\\\" of the natural law.  Therefore, some revisions are in order, since the class of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.   It seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system because perhaps you think that it would imply inherence, which would necessitate some sort of grand design?   I think I have.  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired behaviors, etc.  An immoral behavior could be unwanted, unproductive, or destructive, etc., depending on the goal of the system (that is, immoral to what end?).\",\" When the Lunar Society's $500M estimate of the cost of a lunar colony was mentioned at Making Orbit, somebody asked Jerry Pournelle \\\"have you talked to Bill Gates?\\\".

I'm serious; I tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but I'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are any.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can look up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).    Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was \\\"rushed\\\", although there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the next year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job, and has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was performed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being \\\"rushed\\\"; Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have been less likely to give up on him.  Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.

If a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church they go to is a logical first choice. You have been born into the family of God. People should hop around from church to church as often as they hop from natural family to family.  If you met the Lord on your own (so to speak) there may not be an  easily identifiable church to try for starters. Here you are more like an orphan. Prayerfully go and \\\"leave yourself on a few doorsteps\\\" and see if anyplace feels like home.   I wouldn't expect that God want to place you in a church where you have difficulty fitting in with the people, but on the other hand there are no perfect churches. If you have an attitude of looking for problems you will both find them and make them. On the other hand if you have an attitude of love and committment, you will spread that wherever you go.   In general, I think that God will try to place you in a church that talks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and is expanding on that base.\",\"Hi,  Can anyone tell me the difference between ~30-pin and 72-pin Simms?

If it's a choice between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is only one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first.  Second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent.  Third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social beasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are two types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which dominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible. But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh rapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!  Now, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a game, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one; when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of interception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to react to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of.  With a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures may be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important -- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the road, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up newspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The larger the dog, the greater your anger.  Dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he are not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.  Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped punishment.\",\"     ....................   This example is probably wrong.

The department has    always used sneaker net to transport files to the MAC, since it requires a       filter to strip out the <LF> characters.

If the answer is positive, you would know if ms-windows is a \\\"mature\\\" OS.    Days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real OS. I can see why they have such question. Ms-windows confuses many people. Microsoft simulated Mac, but it did a lousy job.  For example:  (1) You can not create hierarchy groups. There is no way to create a group     in a group. (If you know how, please tell me.) (2) Too many system parameters to take care of.  (3) uncomplete documentation. It's not easy to find the reason why causes     an unpredictable error. (4) Group deleting/file deleting     After deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files.     But if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full     of nonsense files. (5) share problem     Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some     language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. You just     can not open or save the program if it is loaded. It makes sense to     prevent from saving, but not opening.  Microsoft try to compromise between DOS and windows, but they just make  ms-windows a graphical DOS with capacity doing mutiple DOS jobs;  the worst thing is they complicate the environment. The orginal purpose of ms-windows should be to simplify the environment, and make PC easier  to use.      It's by no means easy to satisfy everybody, but if Microsoft want to keep their reputations, they should evaluate the user interface more carefully before products distribute.

It is not asserted to be \\\"the truth\\\" so no flames, please.  It comes out of a background of 20 years as a senior corporate staff executive in two Fortune 50 companies.  I'd be happy to use a crypto system supplied by the NSA for business, if they told me it was more secure than DES, and in particular resistant to attempts by Japanese, French, and other competitive companies and governments to break.  I'd be happy to do so even with escrowed keys, provided I was happy about the bona fides of the escrow agencies (the Federal Reserve would certainly satisfy me, as would something set up by one of the big 8 accounting firms).  I'd trust the NSA or the President if they stated there were no trap doors--I'd be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined the thing under seal of secrecy and reported back that it was secure.  I'd trust something from the NSA long before I'd trust something from some Swiss or anybody Japanese.  This may seem surprising to some here, but I suggest most corporations would feel the same way. Most/many/some (pick one) corporations have an attitude that the NSA is part of our government and \\\"we support our government\\\", as one very famous CEO put it to me one day.

The scenario I outline is more similar to the Oliver North trial. Ollie confessed to treason (aiding an enemy of the US) during Senate hearings, under immunity. The team which was later to prosecute him on criminal charges had to sequester itself from all reports of ON's immunized testimony. ON's lawyer brought up the probability that at least someone on the team had heard about the Senate testimony, and it was a strong factor against the prosecution, which is one of the reasons this ON is still walking around free today.\",\"From the Santa Rosa (Cal.) Press-Democrat, April 15, 1993, p. B2:      Male sex survey: Gay activity low      A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough     examination of American men's sexual practices published since     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2     percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and     1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.      The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday     by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than     the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional     wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report.  The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners. The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3. Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson, and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general male population.  It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are.\",\" however, the word \\\"pa^ques\\\" in french _is_ the word for easter.  ask any francophone, whether from quebec or from paris.  besides, haven't you heard of the phrase \\\"the paschal lamb\\\" (meaning jesus)?  sorry to nitpick on the more trivial part of this thread....\",\"Surely some one of you is familiar with what a mail-order company goes through.

I keep  getting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the  program. When I compile the program, it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so  I can't seem to explain why it crashes.  All it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and after a while of sitting, it will screw up all the variables. This leads me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing.    Does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions that do not return anything??

The Caps have a shot at least - the Flyers sure don't\",\"  \\\"Assuming\\\"? Also: come on, Brad. If we are going to get anywhere in  this (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never  addressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is  \\\"right\\\" or who is \\\"wrong\\\", only that civilians ARE being used as cover  and that, having been placed \\\"in between\\\" the Israelis and the guerillas, they *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.    [The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms   is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that   civilians will not be thought of by the other side as  \\\"combatants\\\". So, what do you think is the \\\"meaning behind\\\",   the intention and the effect when an \\\"army\\\" purposely   *does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look   like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will   receive from this \\\"cover\\\" is more important that the harm  that will come to civilians.*  This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians in \\\"the middle\\\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians.   But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves  at greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \\\"why set   ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made   cover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of   view, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept   some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.   I agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND ineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait  until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that \\\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\\\" will do more to stop attacks.   As I said previously, Israel spent several decades \\\"sitting passively\\\" on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after* the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well. The \\\"host\\\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks  from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact  on the civilians caught in their path.    This is just another \\\"selectively applied\\\" statement.   The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your criteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.  That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for  the \\\"interim\\\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are demanding conditions that essentially define \\\"autonomy\\\" already. They DO NOT trust that Israel will \\\"follow through\\\" the entire process and allow Palestinians to reach full autonomy.   Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians?  If you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians  be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words? Since they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up \\\"tangible assets  (land, control of areas) in exchange for \\\"words\\\". For this reason, they are also concerned about the sorts of \\\"guarantees\\\" they will have  that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.  Absolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the Israelis \\\"word\\\" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being demanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party finally gets HOLD of this \\\"land\\\", what the \\\"other party\\\" does is totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land, your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to keeps its word does NOT get the land back.   While the \\\"major armaments\\\" (those allowing people to wage \\\"civil wars\\\") have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still remain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and \\\"commando\\\" raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.   Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks were commonplace.   There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively \\\"disarmed\\\" UNLESS the state is as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially mirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.  That's what I said, ok? But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to \\\"take over\\\" Lebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that. What both \\\"sides\\\" need is to receive something \\\"tangible\\\". The Arabs/ Palestinians are looking for \\\"land\\\" and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it gives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHEN it gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks\",\"In 12-step programs (like Alcoholics Anonymous), one of the steps involves acknowleding a \\\"higher power\\\".  AA and other 12-step abuse- recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.  Unfortunately, as evidence for God, this can be dismissed by stating that the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes  people 'religious', and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that being religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict, but still maintain that both are escapism.  (And I suspect that there are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to Christianity.)  I think that an essential problem with communication between Christ- ians and atheists is that as Christians we necessarily see ourselves as incomplete, and needing God (the 'God-shaped hole'), while atheists necessarily see themselves as self-sufficient.  If the atheists are right, Christians are guilty of being morally weak, and too cowardly to stand up for themselves; if the Christians are right, the atheists are guilty of considerable arrogance.  (I use the term atheist to refer to a person who has a definite conviction that there is no God, as opposed to one who does not know and/or does not care about God.) == Seanna Watson   Bell-Northern Research,       | Pray that at the end of living, (seanna@bnr.ca) Ottawa, Ontario, Canada       | Of philosophies and creeds,                                               | God will find his people busy Opinion, what opinions?

It's somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry happens in this instance to have originated in rec.scouting, since I always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity.  I understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who happen to be of a different race, religion, ethnic background, sex, or other inconsequential characteristics.  All the evidence I've seen indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are exactly such inconsequential characteristics.  Thus, pending further evidence, I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people are bigots, and organizations that exclude such people are discriminatory.\",\"1) Complete 80386Dx25Mhz System for sale    SVGA card/w color Tatung VGA Monitor    2s/1p    2 floppies (1.44 and 1.2)    230 Watt Power supply    1 meg ram installed    80 meg IDE 14ms Hard drive    Best offer...  2) Bits and pieces  a) IDE controller card  b) internal 2400 baud modem  c) 80386Dx25Mhz CPU  d) 3 megs SIMM memory  e) Standard VGA card  3) Panasonic KXP-1524 Wide Carriage 24 pin Printer  Brand new condition  comes with plenty 'o ribbons  Parallel and Serial ports  Nice crisp output  ALl items are in beautiful condition.

Where do they come  #from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from #whatever is societally mandated.  It's only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily very crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what is necessary to keep that society going  - and often it's a little over-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different thing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble), but is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating meat may be perfectly legal.  # #>#Merely a question for the basis of morality #># #>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_. #># #>#1)Who is society # #>Depends on the society. # #Doesn't help.  Is the point irrelevant?  No.  Often the answer is \\\"we are\\\".  But if society is those who make the rules, that's a different question.  If society is who should make the rules, that's yet another.  I don't claim to have the answers, either, but I don't think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things about the US system, at least in principle.  # #>#2)How do \\\"they\\\" define what is acceptable? # #>Depends. #On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).

The hard trick is to recognise when it is, and equally importantly, when it isn't.  # and only interfering when it's truly #>necessary. # #Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?  IMO, it isn't often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various kinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive  the right to interfere is a difficult question - it's a sort of liar's paradox: \\\"force is necessary for freedom\\\".   One possible justification is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if their own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise if we don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom. # #  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem #>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem #>to agree that some level of interference is necessary. # #They see the need for a \\\"justice\\\" system.  How can we even define that term?  Only by consensus, I guess.  #  Thus you #>get a situation where \\\"The law often allows what honour forbids\\\", which I've #>come to believe is as it should be.   # #I admit I don't understand that statement.  What I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may also be seen as immoral.   The law lets you do it, but you don't let yourself do it.  Eating meat, for example.\",\"or there   Okay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.  The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was because of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by scanning this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines).  When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \\\"I want to play a mono sound\\\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted the documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound.  Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from the IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.  Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware, and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase works. On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra 700/900/950 at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel only. Both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification, but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.  If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their games will only come out the left on some games.  The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related. It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what machine you have.  Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list: and also Hellcats, Super Tetris Oxyd (and many more, these are just what I've tested)  Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.   Other games you list: and also PGA Tour Golf Civilization (and more, these are again only from personal experience)  Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.  The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT! Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to do, but I'm going say it anyway. Stop cheating on sound! Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period is about to end. The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will work even better soon, so use it.  In conclusion: To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug. To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all hardware.   Have fun.  Disclaimer number 1: I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed. So don't write me with sound questions.  Disclaimer number 2: If it says up above that I wrote anything like \\\"the grace period is about to end\\\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.

Presumably only recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention. The necessity it refers to has always been there, but it's been implicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of the new window.   [...]  This is because the warning you read is incomplete.  You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a border-pixel, and the problem should go away.  There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.

Recursiveness has no problems, it is just horribly inefficient (just ask any assembly programmer.)   The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights, is a complete lie and deception, as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving.  Liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost,  almost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable? Similarly for right of life.  When one person must die if he is to save another, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable?   That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty,  especially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable, the serial killer, or the victim?  According to that beautiful line, those two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should be able to remove them.  This _includes_ government.  Admittedly the serial killer has restricted some people's life and/or liberty, but is not his own life/liberty inviolate also?  According to the declaration of independence, it is.   Oooh, I like that.  It means that killing an infant is not murder because it cannot be against its will.  Reason, an infant has no will as such.  Similarly for people who are brain dead (easier to see), in a coma, etc.  Also, under current law, accidental killing is still murder.  How will you include that?   The only real golden rule in life is, he who has the gold, makes the rules.  I.e. Might Makes Right.  That is survival.  Now what is wrong with that?   If you mean the golden rule as I stated, yes, almost every system as implemented has used that in reality.  Sorry, I don't deal as much in fiction, as I do in reality.

With a VGA-adapter (as described in Dale Adams' posting about Quadra video) it works, only some minor interferences occur, small enough not to prevent any action on screen to be visible & clear.  But because the scanrates & stuff of 3D are well enough for emulating Apple 13\\\" RGB, I first made an adapter, then got one fron the local distributor of NEC. With both adapters I can get a picure, which looks excellent most of the time or every now and then. But with radical changes on screen (opening palettes, large windows etc.) there are major interferences in sync. The picture either tilts sideways or scrables up totally. Even when it is clear, there are some \\\"spiky\\\" interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing pull-downs etc. With the self-made adapter, almost identical to the VGA one, only sense pins differ, it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a picture clear enough to shut down from menu... With the adapter from NEC, everything is well most of the time, but sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely lost. But not nearly as often as with the self-made one.  I know, with self made adapters there can always be interference, but with the one provided by NEC... where's the source of this interference?

The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems like heart attack and stroke.  'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1,000,000 Americans using firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some may have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in  using firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population.

(Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity since it was coined by Bnai Brith)  What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media, is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.  However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.  As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.  Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the Jews used to establish their state : Religion. \",\"[why are atheists atheists/ believes it could be the result of \\\"brokenness\\\"]   i agree -- if you are going to find out anything from people who don't share your beliefs, do not attack them or condescend to them and hope to get a neutral picture of them.  come to them with an open mind.   well, you do believe in something, as i see it, even if it is a sort of \\\"anti-belief\\\" (no negative connotation meant; i mean simply that you believe that God _does not_ exist).  christians can also feel that sense of \\\"difference\\\", however, when they are associated with \\\"those weird televangelists who always talk about satan\\\".  if you'll excuse the cliched sound of this, everyone has to deal with his/ her differences from other people.  i can understand how being an atheist could be hard for you; being a christian is sometimes hard for me.   you should not have to repress how you feel -- you should be able to discuss it without fear.  i think there are admirable things to learn from any belief, which can enrich your own -- by asking myself the questions that atheists may ask me, i can learn the answers and become stronger in my faith.  if my faith can't support knowing the answers to those questions, it is weak and untrue.    in some way the pressures were different, of course, because you \\\"chose\\\" your beliefs -- or are you saying that they were not your choice, but born of necessity?

The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of  the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi  to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]    The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain  etymology. It may originally have meant \\\"member of the tribe,\\\" as in the Avestan compound mogu-tbish (\\\"hostile to a member of the tribe\\\"). This meaning would have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \\\"member of the priestly tribe\\\" and perhaps to \\\"priest\\\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is probably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \\\"Magoi\\\" as one of the six tribes of the Medes.   For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a priestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were responsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their knowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median priesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median monarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century through the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the Great (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political and civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced concerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period (Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by Darius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by Greek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of the Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.   The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be attested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.   There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of the priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the Avestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \\\"gift\\\"), is not without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found, in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of purity, or separation of the \\\"mixture\\\" of the two opposed principles of spirit and matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \\\"chorus,\\\" from the root mangh, which is said to mean \\\"sing the magic song\\\" (Nyberg, 1966) and has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though there may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the Avestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite a recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore the Avestan term for \\\"priest,\\\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is  perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis  (Gershevitch, 1964).   The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the Pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in particular derives from an older form, magupati (\\\"head of the Magi\\\"). During the Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of a hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\\\"the high priest of high priests\\\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical hierarchy.   The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl., khwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it. The corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons of putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the Parsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this rite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was in vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with wax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples of Central Asia.   The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a ritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also known for the practice of killing harmful, or \\\"Ahrimanical,\\\" animals (khrafstra) such as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants, tunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of felt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their breath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition that is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was that of the priesthood: white.   In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in possession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they gradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally inclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this they were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible for teaching the prince the \\\"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\\\" and thus the \\\"cult of the gods.\\\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and master of himself.   During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great influence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of Gaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself Smerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation - the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media, in Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.   No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were renowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of the greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men who arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in Bethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were also known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism; this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek, like \\\"goes,\\\" \\\"expert in the magic arts\\\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.   To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called western Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must have been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in contact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in varying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.   The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their varying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical historians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their customs, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism, belief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology and eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted Zoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and placed themselves under his venerable name.   Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those elements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite often, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the Zoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \\\"the law-abjuring daivas\\\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and practices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first chapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the supreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.; Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of all evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the land of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it has been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own priesthood, would be very strange.   The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the first millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to us especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of the ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles of the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\\\"beneficent spirit\\\") and Angra Mainyu (\\\"hostile spirit\\\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra Mainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans- formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro- astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the Mesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known to the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which we give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]   Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of Zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises on the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have survived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of wisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority of such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an abundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).   Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]   The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the religious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce, 1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of Iran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to establish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures in the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar and Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.\",\"CBD>From: Christopher Bradley Devlin <cd1i+@andrew.cmu.edu>  CBD>>but it's nothing compared to the (ahem) unique helmet CBD>>design seen in the new Animated Series: it has a huge opening for his CBD>>mouth, topped by the world's tiniest eyeslits above the enormous mouth CBD>>opening.

OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression.    Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved one (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person having  recurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally, the individual attempts to ignore or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.   The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rather than being from an external source.  Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing, or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a source of the anxiety.  In OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the individual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair their daily routine and social relationships.  Treatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimes certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating obsessions and compulsions.

MARCU$\",\"------ X-posted to comp.sys.mac.hardware and misc.consumers -------  You've heard about Apple's great new customer \\\"support\\\" program.  Well, think again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple computer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on:  In the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort by Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple's attention a problem with certain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice \\\"stick\\\" in the down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the machine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the reported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of BCGA65431. You'll recognize this \\\"sticky button\\\" symptom immediately if you have such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it's not subtle.  Liam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead  suggested that people contact Apple's Customer Assistance Center directly (_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described my defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told Apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of warranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering where my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the serial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed) range Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.  Nothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make it worth Apple's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice. Please, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don't assume you know what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start hacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it. Please take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:                    United States      1-800-776-2333                   Canada             800-665-2775                   UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01                   Australia          61-2-452-8000                   Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500  If the number isn't toll-free, call collect.  Describe the problem and ask for a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse, insist that they register the details of your case, including your mouse's serial number.  Be firm.  Network managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your user bases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please don't send mail to me or post yet another \\\"sticky-button\\\" report, CALL APPLE DIRECTLY!

Those were the days....\",\"I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my wife and me lately: liturgy, in particular, Catholic liturgy.  In the last few years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It's driving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is that what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to  do it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we  present to God.  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.  Lately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion of sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do (which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing. Example.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usually on Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, taking the role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say \\\"Crucify him\\\" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we'd do it again.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were \\\"invited\\\" to sit during the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian \\\"invitation\\\",  I was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seems typical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the musicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the liturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to be explained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we're just sitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about to be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay \\\"experts\\\", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a bias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact of bureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for people to be aware of the Lord's presence.  So we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass going down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or Friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware  of God's presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should  just offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational participation in Catholic Masses lately?\",\" Judging by the way the Reds' pitchers have performed thus far, it appears to me that the zone has been squeezed to the size of a grape.    1/2 :-)\",\":  : All I have to say is...yeah, right.

Why is there such a strong correlation between interest in cryptography and immaturity I wonder.\",\"  I will answer this as I find time.   Notice what I said about this book.  I called it \\\"Easy reading.\\\"  The reason I dropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical Simon's.  I don't know how many walking encyclopedia's I ran across in philosphy classes.  The problem isn't in knowing sooooo much more than your average lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it.  Schaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he was writting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was to simple.  I've talked with Schaeffer one on one.  I've been in lectures with the man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof's from secular as well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories)  His answers were enough that the prof's themselves often were taken back and caused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again at different open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well, simplistic.  It certainly isn't grad level reading.  But we must get off our high horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think most people would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more to say about this secular scientist at another time.  Also, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent* inquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt base.    Look, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we must add a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none in keeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we know its limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust it of all value!  THis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic.  It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christian faith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, we fly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic lesson of life:   \\\"More without limits is less;  less with limits is more.\\\"    Or as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/o freedom.  Let's put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to absurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell the difference between the two if you will let it.  Christianity's contention with rationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has very little else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust go hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called to go on by itself without his understanding.  This is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if the Christian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgment and say, \\\"Father I do not understand you but I trust you.\\\"  Now don't read all your objections of me into that statement.  I wasn't saying I do not understand you at all, but I trust you anyway.\\\" It means that \\\"I do not understand You *in this situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway\\\"  Therefore I can trust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mystery unrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter is a statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of Faith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It is not a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always know why, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all the difference.  Now, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted company with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit more difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith like the insistent \\\"whying\\\" of a 3 year old.  It isn't just that we would like to know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannot know.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the other leads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is in coming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after coming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always need to know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to grasp that, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand may count decisevely against what we are able to trust.    If, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trust him in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xian leaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which allows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may be ambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery to us, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity. And that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in practice.   \",\"    Well, yes, the exhaust is where the majority of the noise comes out, but the basics (tone, firing cadence, etc.) are determined by the engine configuration.

That was my point all along, Fred.      I see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations, not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not debate.  Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last point.  Why don't you take a poll, Fred, if you want some psuedo-objective point-of-view?  And, as usual, you defend your insults with \\\"he started it.\\\"  \\\"Yeah, I took some of his research and called it my own, but he started it.\\\"  \\\"So what if I stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first.\\\"  Besides that, I think it's still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it. So your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway.  Your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool:  \\\"I never borrowed it, I already gave it back, and it was broken when you gave it to me.\\\"  Make up yer mind, Fred!      First, I try to address what I think you meant, for which I am rewarded with a denial of sorts, and a smart remark.  Then, I point out that I am not clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wrongly interpreting you a second time, and I'm stupid for it.  I just can't win, can I, Fred?  You've got a great point here somewhere, it's just that between stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.   *** Fred issue #2;  Nick's alleged meaning ***  Too bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick's, or you would have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had.  My reading of what Nick actually said is that \\\"people aren't required in all parts of all space processes\\\", so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program, I read as \\\"People are required in all parts of all space processes.\\\"  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I'm so patently stupid.

If the latter, I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)  The point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I'd only be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that's your job, Fred.  And, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points, simultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a 'plan' that only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone.   No, no, I finally got it.  You don't like the plan that Nick's posts made you imagine.  And you don't like Nick's obnoxious behavior, even though it's no worse than your own.

If you do, consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years. If you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I went down exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It's just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's no worse than your own.  Let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical, while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and my complaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling isn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might see it better, Fred.  \\\"Net.ghod wannabe\\\"?

I didn't really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was to impress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such a jerk that you'd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands.

It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you very much).   well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell me the order of the wires.   there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.   if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.   btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of little boxes). Oh, well . . .   one more thing: in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on the newer models are different from the connection used on the plus--- you're right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plus and connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. in other words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible. it's merely a matter of finding out the correct order.   omt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solution so others can, too. thanx for the input.\",\"At one time there was speculation that the first spacewalk  (Alexei Leonov ?) was a staged fake.

I have tried to find info on this but I could not get precise answers.  On one hand, we have a Quadra 950 with a 16\\\" monitor, which is capable of 32-bit color. How much VRAM does it have? On the other hand, we have a Quadra 800 with a 16\\\" monitor, which is capable of 8-bit color only, so it must have 512 Ko of VRAM.  I would like to take VRAM SIMMs for the 950 and put them in the 800 so that both machines have 16-bit color capability. Is it possible, and if yes, how many VRAM SIMMs should I take from the 950? From the documentation I have, the Quadra 800 must get 1 Mo VRAM to have 16-bit color, is that correct?  Bonus question: where do VRAM SIMMs hide? From the 950 documentation, they seem to be *behind* the power supply. Do I really have to take off the power supply to access the VRAM SIMMs?   Thanks for your help! \",\"It was announced on NPR 4/17/93 10:00 am EDT, that Turkish President Ozal died  of a heart attack in Ankara.  \",\" Secular laws seem to value criminal life more than the victims life, Islam places the rights of society and every member in it above  the rights of the individual, this is what I call true human rights.   As a Muslim living in a non-Muslim land I am bound by the laws of the land I live in, but I do not disregard Islamic Law it still remains a part of my  life. If the laws of a land conflict with my religion to such an extent that I am prevented from being allowed to practise my religion then I must  leave the land. So in a way Islamic law does take precendence over secular law but we are instructed to follow the laws of the land that we live in too.  In an Islamic state (one ruled by a Khaliphate) religions other than Islam are allowed to rule by their own religious laws provided they don't affect the genral population and don't come into direct conflict with state  laws, Dhimmis (non-Muslim population) are exempt from most Islamic laws on religion, such as fighting in a Jihad, giving Zakat (alms giving) etc but are given the benefit of these two acts such as Military protection and if they are poor they will receive Zakat.   After the Fatwa didn't Rushdie re-affirm his faith in Islam, didn't he go thru' a very public \\\"conversion\\\" to Islam? If so he is binding himself to Islamic Laws. He has to publicly renounce in his belief in Islam so the burden is on him.  Mas  \",\"I am interested in finding out how the 4Runner and Pathfinder have been updated in the past few years.

At the end of last season, the contracts of several veterans with somewhat maginal contributions (Fenton, Bozek, Anderson, and a couple others I can't remember) were bought out. The idea was that youngsters could play almost as well, and had the potential to improve where these older guys did not.  And they traded Mullen, because he wanted to go, not because he wasn't good enough, but I think they were a bit too optimistic in thinking they could make up for his contributions. An example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis but not kept, because of his age. I thought he was a decent contributor worth keeping around.  The youth movement has its advantages; look at Gaudreau who might still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around.

Article crossposted from comp.os.ms-windows.apps ] [ Author was Dr. Richard Timmer ] [ Posted on 24 Apr 93 23:11:16 GMT ]   Hello WinNetters:  I have seen a great deal of discussion herein on the relative merits of  MS Access and Borland Paradox/Win.  However, are there any users out there  with experience with the database package called \\\"Approach\\\".  It has gotten a number of very good reviews from the various mags. and it seems like it would require less hardware overhead than Paradox.  I have ruled out Access because some aspects of it are extremely non-intuitive, e.g. requiring a field to always have a value.  I like what I've seen of Paradox, but it seems like the resource requirements are greater than what I have (386/25 MHz, 6 MB ram).  So, please provide me with your thoughts are \\\"Approach\\\", good and bad.  Thanks. \",\"Does anyone know what causes the ever-growing black border around the edges of my computer screen?  The growth has been gradual so I don't know how long it's taken to get this bad.

[AFS]     Just a quick comment:: [AFS] [AFS]     Armenians killed Turks------Turks killed Armenians. [AFS] [AFS]     Simple as that. Can anybody deny these facts?  Jews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was  quite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi  revisionists say!  [SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in [SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups) [SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother. [SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were  [SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy  [SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not  [SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.  OK.  [SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my [SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these  [SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe  [SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people, [SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...  There is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the Armenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno- Georgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever  killed in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of Anatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian- Georgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after the Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the extermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died in this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of preparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish  genocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers away!  [SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people [SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women', [SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed [SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these  [SY] people not to hate all Armenians.   I don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.  [SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region, [SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation. [SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some [SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts. [SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish [SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with [SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately [SY] very easy to start a fire!  Again, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to do with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that the Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan,  and Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through  Tiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians  militarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of Caucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement  caused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years  earlier in eastern Anatolia. My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek ->  Erzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople ->  Massachusetts.   [SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience [SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were [SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to [SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves [SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail.  My grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste potato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian young man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential, local Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive  today.  [SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense. [SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.  But [SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before. Why  [SY] should they become enemies?  \",\"  Carl, it is not \\\"placebo effect\\\" if as hypothesised the  sensory response to MSG's effect on flavor is responsible for the MSG reaction.\",\"Now we have strong evidence of where the CPR really stands.

Beginning with U.N. Security Council Resolution 713 of    September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively    addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security    Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all    unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There    have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages    in Bosnia have been bombed.      In response to these violations, the Security Council decided,    in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all    unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize    Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-   zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.     NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air    enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General    was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY    FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating    allies.      The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my    direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to    all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct    of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by    the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces    initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and    12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.     These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m.    e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for    combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.      NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air    patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early    Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally    operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the    Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching    the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted,    escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these    steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such    aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by    NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved                                     more                                              (OVER)                                     2      rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will    be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations    Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was    consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully    considered before the rules of engagement were approved.      It is not possible to predict at this time how long such    operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces    to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional    authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-   tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and    I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward    toward attainment of our goals in this region.

Chiropractic: all illness stems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae.  Such systems are so patently absurd, that any good they do is accidental and not related to the theory.  The only exception is probably herbalism, because scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants and are always interested in seeing if they can find new plants that have active and useful substances.

The central point I made is that local/state police agencies attempting to play by the rules and get warrants, legit escrowed keys, etc., may find themselves at the mercy of bureaucratic inertia and agency infighting at the federal level.    I disagree that this would assist civil liberties by hobbling the cowboy cops.

What would they have to do to         decipher the message?     A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^         court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.         ^^^^^^^^^^^  The clear implication is that there are \\\"legal\\\" authorizations other than a court order.  Just how leaky are these?  (And who  knows what's in those 7 pages that authorized the NSA?).  There may well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies, in which keys are traded.  Furthermore, the police will be in an excellent position to carry out this kind of thing without being caught.  They already have a communication infrastructure with secure portions.  There are a few laws that I know of, that limit citizens' rights to access police communications (or use the information they get).  It may be very difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have such evidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law.  Throw in private detectives, who have even fewer policy/constitutional restrictions.  Also consider mercenaries who've \\\"retired\\\" from intelligence agencies.  William Gibson must be loving it.  Great story material.  Don't think it'll happen?    Well, consider e.g. the Michigan State Police, generally a very professional organization, which for years kept \\\"Red Files\\\" on thousands of suspected  commies, knowing full well it was not consititutional.  The standards of evidence were just about zero: people were in the file because they happened to park near a place where, say, a US-China People's Friendship rally was happening -- the police went around writing down license plate numbers.  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the  meeting place, well, the state police wound up filing you as a subversive. (They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on any more such nonsense.  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes as well.)  Even with well-meaning cops (and I'm sure there are many), there will  be strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards.  We don't need to assume corrupt or unbalanced officers -- it will all be in the interest  of enforcing sensible laws, saving lives, and protecting property.   Compromises will be made by well-meaning officers, facing what (to them)  will be a moral dilemma.  Clipper will make criminals out of cops.

It happened in La Salle, France.  The moral lesson of the story is:  The Lamb of God has been sacrificed and His blood has  been used to cleanse us of our sins every moment as God perceives worthy of being done in Heaven.  Mary weeps for The Lamb and for the rest of her offsprings.  This will continue while we  disobey God or sin against Him.  Mary, as a messenger,  has been given the task to make us be 'aware' of the evil serpent (communism, wars, famine, unfaithful, disobedience to God, etc.) running after the rest of her offsprings.    The children who went astray by disobedience led by the dragon is  brought back by her peace and loving messages, reparations for sins,  to obey God's commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence  of The Lamb.  As she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing the Son of God in her womb, Mary has been preparing us, the Church, the Body of Christ, for His second coming (making sure we are  protected from the dragon).  Also, she has been preparing the new  Eden, by reversing the deed of the ancient Eve.  The new Eden will be the sanctuary of the righteous as judged by Christ in His next coming.      I relate the story again:     I believe this and Mary, in one of her apparitions       in 19th or 20th century, she appeared to these           two children who tends goats and cows (I forgot          the exact place).  She was  weeping and telling the      children that she is afraid she's \\\"going to lose her     Son's arm\\\".  She is mourning too for these               townfolks because it was their fault that there          would be drought in their harvest; not much good         food again this year as it was last year.                                                                         Mary tells the children:                             *    Most of the townfolks in this place worked whole    * *    week even on Sundays when they should be in church  * *    honoring God.

The critique comes from THE TUFTS    DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...]   \\\"Chances are good that if you watched '60 Minutes' last November  3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In  the segment entitled 'No MSG,' for instance, show host Ed Bradley  makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them  ('millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently  sick'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven  personal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the  substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive   those studies are.   Consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to  a study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order  to back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that MSG,  a flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as  in many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOT  make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on  humans but on rabbits.   One of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist  Patricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that  a small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get   headaches from it.  'But,' she explains, 'the show probably   overemphasized the extent of the problem.'   A second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor  at the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley  remarks, 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory  animals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters' because  it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney's  research with lab animals does not 'show' anything about human  youngsters.   In fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney's   experiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected  extremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing   their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly,  and when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance  to very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither  of those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG   with food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by  enzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little  reaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human  blood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations  found in Dr. Olney's lab animals.....   The World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of  that fact.  And so does the European Communities' Scientific  Committee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies,  have concluded that MSG is safe.   Their determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never  been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed  to it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a  burning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe  of clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently  exonerated the much-maligned substance.   That's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of  monosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever  we eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one  of the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken  down into glutamate during digestion.   It's a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the  most abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes  up about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in  milk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.   That doesn't mean it's entirely unimaginable that a small number  of people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore  sensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, international  professional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensus  reached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large.\\\" \",\" [Warning: Flammage to follow...]  Ah, that British sense of humor.

We've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level for most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined slights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'll happen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I've seen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep the next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact with us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his choice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.    From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a relationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful relationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, \\\"Why be dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse to get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to come back.\\\" It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on with the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I could think of.    Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and raved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and in which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was beyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the allowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not quietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their relationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung up. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is the first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if she's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have the break out in the open and done with.       I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself; angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for persisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their children; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us that he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to appease an unappeasable, emotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess; scared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will change and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self- righteous over this bit of proof that they can't \\\"get away\\\" with treating us or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even beginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad, sad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in a horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--or they can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustrated because I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me up the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence, and vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am not free of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO* something, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besetting vices; I'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal mental chatter enough to listen for God.)   Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? Is this a time to reach out to my brother? To let things be? How can I conquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him?   Here's the big question I've been evading throughout this long, long post: Is it ok, as a Christian and a proponent of faith, hope, and charity, to accept the destruction of a relationship? To give up on my own brother, or at least to accept that I am powerless to help him and can only wait and see what happens? Do please answer--by e-mail or post.

Whilst I have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some relevant books are listed in a companion article.  To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.  Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism.  So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine being.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it may not.  \\\"What is atheism?\\\"  Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is often referred to as the \\\"weak atheist\\\" position, and the latter as \\\"strong atheism\\\".  It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \\\"Weak atheism\\\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \\\"Strong atheism\\\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \\\"strong atheists\\\".  Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making flat-out denials.  \\\"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?\\\"  Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not.  Which brings us to agnosticism.  \\\"What is agnosticism then?\\\"  The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed (\\\"strong\\\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable.  Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether God exists.  Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people use agnosticism to mean \\\"weak atheism\\\", and use the word \\\"atheism\\\" only when referring to \\\"strong atheism\\\".  Beware also that because the word \\\"atheist\\\" has so many shades of meaning, it is very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for sure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe.  \\\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\\\"  There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.  Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that such a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they see no evidence that God exists.  \\\"But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\\\"  There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects obeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly well-defined is a matter for debate.  However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of God.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.  If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest primes, because we can prove that they don't exist.  Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of the time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.  To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be tested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to prove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by default that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.  Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God exists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be possible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious book does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described by any present-day religion exists.  In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of God are not really applicable.  \\\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\\\"  If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction must be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable.  If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue that if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no importance whether he exists or not.  If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites. Surely he should still be detectable today?  Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically verifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him from all the other things that don't exist?  \\\"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but  isn't it still a religious belief?\\\"  One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \\\"the redefinition game\\\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:  Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out that it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He then records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to it, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \\\"agreed fact\\\", but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.  The point of this digression is that the answer to the question \\\"Isn't atheism a religious belief?\\\" depends crucially upon what is meant by \\\"religious\\\".  \\\"Religion\\\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and worship.  [ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not   \\\"religion\\\" according to such a definition. ]  Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of \\\"religious\\\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \\\"religious\\\" as well -- such as science, politics, and watching TV.  \\\"OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is  still just an act of faith, like religion is?\\\"  Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in.  Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt.  Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are the sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called \\\"acts of faith\\\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.  Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something. According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is \\\"certain\\\".  This is not a general tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists.  Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof. Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism has no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or the lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.  \\\"If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?\\\"  It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \\\"for\\\" or \\\"against\\\", \\\"friend\\\" or \\\"enemy\\\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.  Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense, it can be said to be \\\"anti-religion\\\".  However, when religious believers speak of atheists being \\\"anti-religious\\\" they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.  This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair. Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.  Most atheists take a \\\"live and let live\\\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they will not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of course, this may be in part because atheism is not \\\"socially acceptable\\\" in many countries.  A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \\\"convert\\\" others when possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.  (To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished.  The institution of \\\"state atheism\\\" came about when Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population.)  Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example, the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate.  \\\"But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,  surely that's the same as state atheism?\\\"  The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of another, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in nature.  Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For example, religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters, and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say.  \\\"What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people  pray?\\\"  Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things that those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in schools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they need not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event.  Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other motives.  \\\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about  atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't  atheists object to the religious charities?\\\"  There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for the sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis.  Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in connection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday matter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say self-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs.  To \\\"weak\\\" atheists, building a hospital to say \\\"I do not believe in God\\\" is a rather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say \\\"Today is not my birthday\\\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.  \\\"You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against  one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?\\\"  Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists.  It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the other hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others.  On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently.  \\\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\\\"  They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.  Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a Verdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts, they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy of the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!  Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance.  \\\"Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?\\\"  That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course atheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when one talks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\\\"right\\\") and unacceptable (\\\"wrong\\\") behaviour within society.  Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must co-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from \\\"anti-social\\\" or \\\"immoral\\\" behaviour, purely for the purposes of self-preservation.  Many atheists behave in a \\\"moral\\\" or \\\"compassionate\\\" way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care what happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.  Naturally, there are some people who behave \\\"immorally\\\" and try to use atheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who behave \\\"immorally\\\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions.  For example:    \\\"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ    came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was    shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited    patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive    eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,    be honor and glory forever and ever.\\\"  The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a religious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?     A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior    deteriorated after \\\"born again\\\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents    said they had driven intoxicated before being \\\"born again,\\\" 12% had done    so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before    conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex    before salvation; 5% after.                                 [\\\"Freethought Today\\\", September 1991, p. 12.]  So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour.  \\\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\\\"  If you mean \\\"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\\\", then the answer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people.  If you mean \\\"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\\\", then the answer is no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \\\"moral rules\\\" as theists, but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by humans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.  \\\"Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?\\\"  A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them.  Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are unbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.  This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that individual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only choice that person can honestly make.  \\\"But don't atheists want to believe in God?\\\"  Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many of them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the \\\"Big Brother\\\" figure might be.  Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of such an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.  \\\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are  unwilling in their souls to see!\\\"  Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained above, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God exists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.  Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded. Comments such as \\\"Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly\\\" are likely to be viewed as patronizing.  Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is futile.  \\\"Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\\\"  Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives meaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives count, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other people who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.  It is a natural human tendency to look for \\\"meaning\\\" or \\\"purpose\\\" in random events.  However, it is by no means obvious that \\\"life\\\" is the sort of thing that has a \\\"meaning\\\".  To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \\\"What is the meaning of life?\\\" is as silly as asking \\\"What is the meaning of a cup of coffee?\\\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.  \\\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\\\"  There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets. Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.  That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so what?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?  In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just hard luck.  \\\"Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\\\"  The short answer is \\\"No, do you?\\\"  Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.  Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of the existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.  \\\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments  apply?\\\"  No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is the sceptical \\\"default position\\\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism is a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.  Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers, but to everyone else.  \\\"What sort of harm?\\\"  Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings; think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on. Imagine how that effort could be better spent.  Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances of ill people being \\\"healed\\\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.  It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- and condoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many third-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.  Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion.  \\\"Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some  sort of excuse.\\\"  What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hard to tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all convinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight and kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REAL Christian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like the Catholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?  In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who calls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his actions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians are just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if the Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't be much of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he have made it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs aren't a perversion of what your God intended?  If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so? Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a Christian.  \\\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since  nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely  that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\\\"  That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue, positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns don't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.  It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \\\"weak\\\" atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still.  \\\"Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?\\\"  Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \\\"correct\\\" it is, or whether it \\\"works\\\"; consider how many people believe in astrology, graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.  Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.  Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world, we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other purposes as well.  \\\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say  something?\\\"  Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's worth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of concept of God in the Christian sense.  Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.  \\\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded  that God exists?\\\"  For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who does not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders.  A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.  \\\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates  nothing?\\\"  Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far.  The theory of memetics talks of \\\"memes\\\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure to keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes.  Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it.  \\\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important  messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\\\"  There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a few of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions.     There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.     Be especially sceptical of positive claims.     If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to    find it.     Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.     Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.     It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change    yourself.     Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.     If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.     Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.  and finally (and most importantly):     All beliefs should be open to question.

Is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is missing the mark?   Are they clear or do you have doubts?   An important first step; the realization that Paul was human.   Yes, and he was writing and speaking for an audience that was at best, very weak in the faith; most could not read, most were unfamiliar with the Hebrew Scriptures in even the Septuagint form. Paul adapted the message of the Bible to a largely uneducated market. Granted, this market still exists today, but do you count yourself as part of it? To be \\\"weak in the faith\\\" is not missing the mark (hamartia) if you do the best that your education allows. Are you doing the best?   Let me make clear that the \\\"Law\\\" is none other than the Pentateuch of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. What did Jesus say about the \\\"Law\\\" in Matt5:14-19? Where did Jesus say that the \\\"Law\\\" only applies to Jews and that Gentiles are above the \\\"Law\\\"?   Who acknowledged this fact? On what basis? Are we extra-biblical at this point? Why not also acknowledge that the Bhagavad-Gita is the only relevant text for Gentiles, after all we see in the Bible that it was Magus from the east who observed the star-signs of Jesus? Why bother with any texts at all? Why not just follow whatever the Church has to say?   I don't see how you can say this with a straight face. Are you a follower of Christ, or do you follow someone else? Are you saying that the words of Jesus only apply to Jews?   How Jewish was Paul after he changed his name from Saul?   Who says Gentile Christians are not covered by the first five books? Who says that Gentile Christians are above the Ten Commandments?   You're implying that Jesus' words are valid only for Jews. Is this really what you mean to say? You do realize that you are gutting rather large portions of the Bible? When you read Jesus' words, did you ever consider that maybe, just maybe Jesus is talking to you, no matter what your race or sex? If the Hebrew Scriptures and the Gospel accounts of Jesus are only directed to Jews, why were they translated into English?   As Paul would call him, one who was weak in the faith.   Which is more important: 1) The recorded word of Jesus or 2) Indications that you can deduce from the Bible? Was Jesus God only of the Jews, or God of all humankind of all race and sex?   This is your understanding of Paul. Compare this to the word of Jesus. Are you Christian or Pauline?   Again, this is your understanding of Paul. Did Jesus say that the Law was an \\\"impossible standard?\\\" Did Jesus say that He superceded the Law? Are you Christian or Pauline?   You acknowledge that it is *your* reading of Paul. What did Jesus say? Can you deny that Matt5:14-19 is quite clear in its meaning? Are you  Christian or Pauline?   When did Jesus say that the purpose of the Law was conviction of sin?   Please reread Matt5:14-19. Are you Christian or Pauline?   Are you saying that the Ten Commandments are ceremonial details?   You call observance of the Sabbath, the day on which the Lord rested, ceremonial? Has circumcision been superceded for Christians?  ....  Are you Christian or Pauline?  [Both.  There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is not, at least not in this case.  Jesus did not deal explicitly with the question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  That's why I have to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.  As to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studies of Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I can't come up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, various Christian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and in other newsgroups.  Mat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid.  It does not say that it applies to Gentiles.  And yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on the Sabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when you're looking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.  I'm not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, it's unfortunate the Jesus didn't answer the question directly.  However we do know (1) what the 1st Cent. Jewish approach was, (2) how Jesus dealt with at least one Gentile, and (3) how Jesus' disciples dealt with the issue when it became more acute (I'm referring to Acts 15 more than Paul).  Given that these are all in agreement, I don't see that there's a big problem.\",\"  Are you certain you didn't mean to post  to alt.french.captain.borg.borg.borg?

You do not have to have a license, your car does not have to be registered or inspected, and you do not have to have insurance or safety training classes, when you own and operate that vehicle on your own premises.

And by the way, in Texas you can drive a car in public (with the proper credentials), but an ordinary civilian can't carry a gun legally in public to save his/her life.  So I won't even consider registration, *manadatory* safety classes, or *manadatory* liability insurance unless I get a federal law repealing all local, state, and federal gun control laws which abridge the Second Amendment, and a non-discretionary federal weapons carry permit, good anywhere in the United States.

I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive,  and am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on  it.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician  Gold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by  having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is  necessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it,  and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard  drive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad  sectors a week.           Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with  an Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this  message twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program  and did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining  for new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about  sectors for a brief period of time.           I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the  exact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the  same error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went  to the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough  there was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG,  but removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors,  either audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the  cache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.           Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix  them, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are  no errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other  files, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them  for a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to  completely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through  the c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.           Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on  my hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in  about every 100 files are affected.             I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s  system, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about  smartdrv to help me out. \",\" Great!

Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming? Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?  The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British Journalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times article. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before Turkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures of people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.  Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these \\\"lies.\\\" They are saying \\\"exaggeration.\\\" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported.

The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.  Some of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.  Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro.

Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci.  Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women  poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did  not exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I  see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.    Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have  no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that  balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians  who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go  from doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and  then when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling  quack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a  quack.    I've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten  years now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were  raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their  farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to  entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is  about 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition  either tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I  know that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at  least a few \\\"enlightened\\\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really  too bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if  they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the  medical profession.  In animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \\\"good\\\" bacteria after  antibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not  have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \\\"good\\\" bacteria is  needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all  kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small  and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are  nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune  system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike  the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce  toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of  these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up  residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this  happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals  and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what  vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling  Elaine's doctor a quack.  Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly  called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a  yeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis. Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it  requires that the host immune system be severly depressed.    Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of  normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral  course of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain  much higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in  it's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely  survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides  the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In  diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little  buggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but  some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus  membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to  the candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on  the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \\\"treat\\\" it. If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty  nondiscript.     Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in  the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the  vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system  ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless  they broach the mucus membrane \\\"barrier\\\".  If they do, an inflammatory  response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A  from their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than  they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin  A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane  barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong  inflammatory response after a candida bloom.    While diabetics can suffer from a candida \\\"bloom\\\" the  most common cause of  this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which  knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main  competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are  available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not  use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of  the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus  inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum  antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate  just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring  vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.  But even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by  the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to  return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of  the problem is addressed(lack of a \\\"good\\\" bacterial flora in the body and/or  poor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective  therapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving  organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not  grow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is  the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum  antibiotics).    In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good  reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very  favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and  humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to  minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.    If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even  blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the  bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology  occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool  for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first  place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong  but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan  has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool  specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of  false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant  basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have  colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a  doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.  Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria  tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline  during a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina.  Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal  problems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of  Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of  the purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina  problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year  until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting  scripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had  the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some  digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she  used in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex  returned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic  GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his  patients is a non-existent syndrome.  The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria  which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.   If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through  aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes. But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system  needs to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and  some of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans  are not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of  the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent  disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).   Some of the above material was obtained from \\\"Natural Healing\\\" by Mark  Bricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human  nutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in  the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely  important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in  the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida  blooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate  intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI  system is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out  grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and  fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check  once carbohydrate is returned to the gut.  If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post,  fine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably  accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin  A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice  from newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our  time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.

Some of what I  would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may  never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars  as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and  a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief  in an afterlife.    The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks  and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light  crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.   Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live  in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The  impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped  into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life  forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels  (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains  one weekend, \\\"getting away from it all\\\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing,  malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed  the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80  miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters  much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.   But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't  fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever -  like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)

That you have to right to express whatever you want in whatever form your little heart desires so long as you do not impinge on the rights of others.  Encrypted text/sound/video is just another form of expression of that particular text/sound/video.

I can believe that.  I'm a newbie here, so I'll take your word.  But Alomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above. That is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long as they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such a consensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to give him that dreaded \\\"seasoning\\\".   Sorry.  New.  Don't know Nichols' Law.

I predicted it among large guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I think it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainly more reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have released one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  It may also be logical.

If it is only used for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file encryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced standard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to easy-to-break inverters.  Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap. Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e-mail and files, let's focus on this.  One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.  Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal less threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have no secure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a \\\"goat\\\" can eavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones.  -------  Reading between the lines, I infer that the system is highly secure without access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanese security services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.  Most legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and would be delighted to have a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of depositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliable escrow. Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the week, and that system has worked pretty well.  From my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that need to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. But in return we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly skilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should be checked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn't have to be, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys pursuant to a legitimate court order. Thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries, while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order.  ------  In discussing this, let's try to avoid the nastiness, personal attacks and noise of some previous threads.

Ostensibly, this field is provided for sevices provided by the religious departments of the gov't, though this is not the general case.   From its onset, Israel's borders have been shaped and reshaped by both war and peace.

Several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography. Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other algorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something like DES) for the encryption.  How could the \\\"back door\\\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few possibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door keys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers used in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.  Another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips simply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own internal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys usable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's secret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be identical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most straightforward to me.)  Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the message itself has a \\\"dual key\\\" property, that possession of either of two keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from the DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.  It's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and December was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would participate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early knowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with Clipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.\",\"# 74S Later modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in #  power consumption.

The author was Paul, and his revelations were anything but \\\"(at best)  second-hand\\\".   \\\"And is came about that as [Saul] journeyed, he was approaching   Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; and   he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, \\\"Saul, Saul,   why are you persecuting Me?\\\"  And he said, \\\"Who art Thou, Lord?\\\"  And   He said, \\\"I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, . . .\\\"   (Acts 9:3-5, NAS)  Paul received revelation directly from the risen Jesus!  (Pretty cool, eh?)  He became closely involved with the early church, the leaders of which were  followers of Jesus throughout his ministry on earth.   I agree.  I don't believe anyone but the Spirit would be able to convince you  the Spirit exists.  Please don't complain about this being circular.  I know it is, but really, can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural? (This is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the Bible.)   The Spirit is part of God.  How much closer to the source can you get? The Greek in 2 Timothy which is sometimes translated as \\\"inspired by God\\\",  literally means \\\"God-breathed\\\".  In other words, God spoke the actual words  into the scriptures.  Many theologians and Bible scholars (Dr. James Boice is  one that I can remember off-hand) get quite annoyed by the dryness and  incompleteness of \\\"inspired by God\\\".   That's what the verse taken from 2 Timothy was all about.  The continuity of a  book written over a span of 1500 years by more than 40 authors from all walks  of life is a testimony to the single authorship of God.    What source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior historicity to the Bible?  Certainly not Josephus' writings, or the writings  of the Gnostics which were third century, at the earliest.   Jesus was fully God as well.  That's why I'd assert that he is wise.   Please rethink this last paragraph.  If there is no God, which seems to be your current belief, then Jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not only did he assert that God exists, but he claimed to be God himself!  (regards to C.S. Lewis)  How then could you have the least bit of respect for Jesus?  In conclusion, be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based on gut feelings about the text and other scholars' unsubstantiated claims.   The Bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out.  About your reading of the Bible, not only does the Spirit inspire the writers, but he guides the reader as well.  We cannot understand it in the  least without the Spirit's guidance:   \\\"For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit   searches all things, even the depths of God.\\\"  (1 Cor 2:10, NAS)   Peace and may God guide us in wisdom.  +-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-= Carter C.

In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean an \\\"air core resonant transformer\\\". The TV flyback version Tesla coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called \\\"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit\\\" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors, which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat, gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and telegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????  GET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE TODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!  If it had been up to Edison, we'd still be in the 19th century. (flame me at your own peril. I'm very good at putting edison down).  ----  ET   \\\"Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time. Perhaps now his time comes\\\".\",\"    Sure, but the surface condition of most good autobahns is far better than most of the roads here. A dip in the asphalt that you test your shocks on at 60 will kill you at 130.

Also, Bush was not trying to deprive us of our Second Amendment rights. Clinton is BUSTING HIS BUTT in that regard.  That reveals a total difference in philosophy.  Clinton appears to support the idea of TOTAL people control.  Eavesdropping whenever they feel like it, no real security for the common person, and no ability to defend oneself against illegal attack, from whatever source.  \\\"Trust us, we will protect (and control) you... if we don't find it inconvenient...\\\"  Clinton has also shown his utter contempt for public disclosure and accountability, as well.

It's appreciated that you will use Archie before asking help in the newsgroups.  Archie servers:   archie.au or 139.130.4.6             (Aussie/NZ)   archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100  (Finland/Eur.)   archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111  (GER.)   cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5             (Israel)   archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (JAPAN)   archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11      (Korea)   archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24  (TWN)   archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7  (UK/Ireland)   archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179    (USA [MD])   archie.unl.edu (password: archie1)    (USA [NE])   archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2         (USA [NY])   archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15     (USA [NJ])   archie.nz or 130.195.9.4           (New Zealand)  Connect to Archie server with telnet and type \\\"archie\\\" as username. To get help type 'help'. You can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call Archie without the burden of a telnet session. 'Xarchie' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc, vol. 27.  To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with subject \\\"help\\\" to \\\"archie\\\" account at any of above sites.  (Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000]. Connect to it and specify \\\"archie\\\" as the host name and \\\"archie\\\" as the username.)  ==========================================================================  2. Notes ======== (Excerpted from the FAQ article)  Please do *not* post or mail messages saying \\\"I can't FTP, could someone mail this to me?\\\"  There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message.  There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message to an automated server saying something like \\\"send comp.sources.unix/fbm\\\", and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.  ==========================================================================  3.

Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes ===========================================  Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help. Don't overuse mail servers.  There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these mail servers have a command like    path a_valid_return_e-mail_address to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.  DEC's FTPMAIL -------------   Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,   and having a line containing the word 'help'.   You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you   must follow in order to get the files you want.    Note that the \\\"reply\\\" or \\\"answer\\\" command in your mailer will not work   for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send   requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.   Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com   address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not   responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.  BITFTP ------   For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.   Send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info.  Lightwave 3D mail based file-server -----------------------------------   A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images   and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.   The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list   and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for   several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.    The server resides on a BBS called \\\"The Graphics BBS\\\".  The BBS is   operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1   908/469-0049.  It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144   V.32bis/V.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps.    If you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server,   please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address:   server@bobsbox.rent.com.    For information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message   to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in   the body of the message:     HELP     /DIR   And a help file describing how to use the server and a complete   directory listing will be sent to you via mail.  [ Now it includes the Cyberware head and shouders in TTDDD format! Check it  out, only if you can't use FTP! -- nfotis ]  INRIA-GRAPHLIB --------------   Pierre Jancene and Sabine Coquillart launched the inria-graphlib mail   server a few months ago.      echo help | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr    will give you a quick summary of what inria-graphlib contains and    how to browse among its files.      echo send contents | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr    will return the extended summary.    As an other example :      echo send cgrl from Misc | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr    will return the Computer Graphics Resource Listing mirrored from   comp.graphics.

Also there's one written in VOGLE, so you can   use any of the devices VOGLE can output on.   (Check in sites carrying VOGLE, like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)  OFF ---   Object file format, from DEC's Randy Rost (rost@kpc.com). [ The object archive server seems to be mothballed.

[For FTP places to get it, see in the relevant place]. There's an OFF   previewer for SGI 4D machines, called off-preview in   godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au . There are previewers for xview and sunview,   also on gondwana.  TDDD ---- It's a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF, Rayshade, Imagine or vort objects. Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):    New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley   (worley@cup.portal.com)    I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format   called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,   from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely   distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.    In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file   with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the   objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially   on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various   object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,   Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables   for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views   in Postscript.  P3D ---   From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight   extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp   interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to   have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.    The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon   Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D   without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.    The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:   Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,   Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from   VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.    The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines   ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory   pub/graphics/programs/p3d.  RenderMan ---------   Pixar's RenderMan is not free - call Pixar for details.  ==========================================================================  8. Solids description formats =============================  a.

IGES [v. 5.1 now] tries to define a standard to tranfer solid   models - Brep and CSG. The current standard number is ANSI Y14.26M-1987   For documentation, you might want to contact Nancy Flower at   NCGA Technical Services and Standards, 1-800-225-6242 ext. 325   and the cost is $100.   This standard is not available in electronic format.  c. PDES/STEP : This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only   the geometrical information, but also for things like FEM, etc.   The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and DARPA. You can get   more information about PDES by sending mail to nptserver@cme.nist.gov   and putting the line  send index   in the body (NOT the Subject:) area of the message.

So why is Cylink the only (and expensive) game in town?  Note: I think Cylink is great, and if my boss would double my salary, I'd buy  a bunch of their stuff :).  One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability, at a higher degree of  security than we currently have in non-proprietary voice encryption systems. This means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme, and easier to  deploy.  This is, of course, either a bug or a feature depending on how you  look at it :).   Great!  Where can I buy it?  Another note: If \\\"Clipper\\\" increases the incentive to bring stronger  encryption to the mass market, all the better.  It's far overpriced at  the moment.   I don't care where we *need* to get it from, I care where we *can* get it  from, and whether it will interoperate with everyone else.    You can build them right now as long as you don't want to export (a  restriction I firmly oppose).  The only thing stopping people from making  cheap encryption is greed: they want a lock on the market.   Oh, come on.  Only if you trust it farther than it deserves.  A Clipper phone  *IS NOT* a substitute for a Cylink phone, or a STU-III.  It's a substitute  for the \\\"voice scramblers\\\" advertised in the back of Radio Electronics.   I disagree.  Modulo ITAR, it's not the government that has sabotaged the  market.   Can you tell me where exactly we have given up that right? \",\" Things could be worse. A lot worse! In the mid-eighties the teen/adult sci-fi comic 2000AD (Fleetway) produced a short story featuring the award winning character \\\"Judge Dredd\\\".

Needless to say, this use hacked off a load of lovers, romantics and werewolfs/crazies. The ad guys got chopped, the service discontinued. A cautionary tale indeed!  Marvin Batty.\",\" Ummm..

I have to talked to a few Duc owners (750SS owners in particular) who say that the power is something less than overwhelming.  That said, I would love to have a 900SS.  I guess I should have been a bit more specific.  If you have something that weighs that same as the 750, go  for the extra cubes.    I think that fact that I own a GTV-6 shows that I don't care about maximum power (it's no slug though) to the exclusion of everything else.  The note  and the handling are more important to me.

(Nothing serious, just enough to keep him out of a game. :)    In most cases, the owners have very little to do with it.  They give their general managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best players so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player is in Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him to be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.  Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian players.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners can do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable here in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US that the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their import ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.  Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would make players better anyways.

(ie. the Jets do have a few Russian players in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.)) So with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players in North America.   I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the world.  I've grown up with Europeans playing on 'my' team, and some of those players were the among the best in the world.  From Hedberg, Nilsson, and Sjoberg, to Sel{nne, Zhamnov, and Olausson, and all those in between and to come, I wouldn't have it any other way.\",\" I second what Spenser Aden said in reply.  Additionally, it is hard to say what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say how long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids for months before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are  every other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start. Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start azathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics about options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of  disease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it is worth.    I treat patients with UC and Crohn's.  An educated patient is a good  patient, but let your doctor know where the advice came from so things can be put in context.  You should also be a member of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America.  1-800-932-2423 office / 1-800-343-3637 info hotline.

When he first mentioned it, I thought he was just making a mistake but then he said it over and over.  And then in the examples from other years, he gave stats for players from both leagues even when only one league expanded.  So (since stats *NEVER* lie :-) ), I guess there is an effect on both leagues because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making  every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up players that, normally, they would not have had there not been expansion.\",\" In billions of dollars (%GNP): year  GNP    receipts     outlays       deficit     debt    unempl%  admin ====  ====   ===========  ============  =========   ======  =======  ======= 1977  1930   355.6 (18.4) 409.2  (21.2) 53.6 (2.8)   709.1           Carter 1978  2174   399.6 (18.4) 458.7  (21.1) 59.2 (2.7)   780.4           Carter 1979  2444   463.3 (19.0) 503.5  (20.6) 40.2 (1.6)   833.8           Carter 1980  2674   517.1 (19.3) 590.9  (22.1) 73.8 (2.8)   914.3   7.9     Carter 1981  2986   599.3 (20.1) 678.2  (22.7) 78.9 (2.6)  1003.9   8.4     Reagan 1982  3130   617.8 (19.7) 745.7  (23.8) 127.9 (4.1) 1147.0  11.0     Reagan 1983  3325   600.6 (18.1) 808.3  (24.3) 207.8 (6.2) 1381.9  10.9     Reagan 1984  3688   666.5 (18.1) 851.8  (23.1) 185.3 (5.0) 1576.7   8.6     Reagan 1985  3958   734.1 (18.5) 946.3  (23.9) 212.3 (5.4) 1827.5   8.1     Reagan 1986  4177   769.1 (18.4) 989.8  (23.7) 220.7 (5.3) 2129.5   7.9     Reagan 1987  4442   854.1 (19.2) 1002.1 (22.6) 148.0 (3.4) 2354.3   7.1     Reagan 1988  4771   909.0 (19.1) 1064.1 (22.3) 155.1 (3.2) 2614.6   6.3     Reagan 1989  5201   990.8 (19.0) 1142.8 (22.0) 152.0 (2.9) 2881.1           Bush 1990         1031.2       1251.6        220.4       3190.5           Bush 1991      1054.3   1323.0 268.7       3599.0           Bush  [Source: Statistical Abstract of the US (1990 version), American Almanac  (1993 version), Universal Almanac (1993 version), Information Please Almanac (1991 version)]    GRAPHICALLY: Deficits as a % of GNP, 1981-89  % GNP 7|  | 6|                       X  |                                       X       X 5|                               X                  |                                                 4|               X  |                                                       X 3|                                                               X       X  |       X 2|  | 1|  |____________________________________________________________________________ 0 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989   Ironically, Bush could have frozen spending, kept his \\\"no new taxes\\\" pledge and balanced the budget.\",\" You can probably get this information by calling your public health department in your county (in Pittsburgh, they give the shots free, as well).

I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from  Dennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated at 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to the relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay pins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.  I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube frame used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to do this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two vertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing follows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing. The compressor is about 2\\\" in diameter and about 5\\\" long.  The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small so there should be plenty of good places for it.  I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to mount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side just in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.  The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out about an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look closely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight ahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).  If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try to explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them first.  How do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound more like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock. I have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has not blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).  I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though they know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping the pedestrians on the sidewalk. The bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to those stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives) and are relatively easy to install on the FJ.

It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that Jesus was Semitic.  As an interesting aside, Jesus' being semitic makes him neither \\\"white\\\" nor \\\"black,\\\" and in some sense underscores the point made earlier that his color was not important, it was his message, his grace, and his divinity that we should concentrate on.  Finally, I would direct anyone interested in African involvement in the church to the account of the conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts chapter 9 (I think it's chapter 9).  This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch, treasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely African.  Because \\\"Ethiopia\\\" at that time indicated a region just south of Egypt, many also speculate that this man was not only the first African Christian, but the first black Christian as well.

I also worship on Saturday to honor the Lord.  Your mention of \\\"[esteeming]  all days alike\\\" IMO has to do with the fast days observed by the Jews.  But  no matter how you interpret that passage, I do accept your worship on Sunday  as being done in honor of the Lord, in contrast with what many of my fellow  SDA believers may believe.  To me, though, the bible overwhelmingly points  to Saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of God's  deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.  To those who would  attempt to point out that my observance of Saturday is being legalistic,  this is simply not the case.  Rather, keeping Saturday allows me a full day  to rest and contemplate God's goodness and grace.    The idea was introduced to me once that the reason Paul wanted the  Corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the first day of the  week was because that was when they received their weekly wages.  Paul  wanted them to lay aside money for the collection as first priority, before  spending their money on other things.  I do not have any proof in front of  me for this though, although it would explain why they would lay aside money  in their homes instead of a meeting.     It would seem to me that you assume that the christians in the NT regularly  worshipped on the first day.  I assume that the christians in the NT  regularly worshipped on the seventh day.

Thx  vlad\",\" I don't claim to be an expert on the branch Davidians, but I might know more  than most.  The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots  of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now  defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.  The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the  SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they  were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.  About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once  in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as  Christ.  Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young  adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over  the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.  They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of  weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US  government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were  putting themselves in a self defense position.    In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn' t have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.  If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the  local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.

Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of 17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff-bound Blues.  The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3. With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit playing.  They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired.  ``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,\\\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.  If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues' disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry's anger.  ``It wasn't pretty at the end,\\\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but it did.\\\"  Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end. Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium.  The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points, their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay, which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.  The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.  ``It's a shame we let down,\\\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others. ``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\\\"  Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. ``We won, and that's all that matters,\\\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3 for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\\\"  Some players didn't have a problem.  ``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,\\\" said Rich Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.  ``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\\\"  Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow, he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.  ``I didn't know it was final,\\\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs, and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end.\\\"  The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.  ``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,\\\" Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.\\\"  If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.  Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then, Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.  With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.  Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.  Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the  rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend.  Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.  ``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\\\" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and I know he was watching. I know he's happy.\\\"  Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo at 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds later, making it 5-1.  Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.  Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third period.  The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the winner. ``We were in there,\\\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\\\"\",\"I believe it goes or will go: 680060 powerPC Pentium 680040 486 680030 386 680020 286=680000  In a resent article in one of the macMags I think a 50mHz 030 accelerator was  slightly slower than a 25mHz 040 accel.

There is no planet inside of the orbit of Mercury.  The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observed perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to Newtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations and calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later improved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's system of equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit of Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was afoot with Mercury.  But alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rate it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly curved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915 and Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian  geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of it's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession of Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb's numbers rather than Leverrier's.)  Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and that's fine.  But subsequent efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar have been fruitless.  -Bill Gawne   \\\"Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe   are the laws of the universe.\\\"                       - G.

He is only insurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcher is injured during a game.     So to free up this roster spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever, why not invoke a catcher re-substitution rule:  If the last roster catcher on a team is injured during a game, the team is permitted to substitute in his place for defensive purposes a catcher who has previously been yanked from the game.     Given this rule, a team wouldn't need 3 roster catchers.  The 3rd catcher could be playing in AAA or be a non-roster bullpen catcher.\",\"Be devoted to one another in brotherly love.

This may be a dangerous thing to do.  It is my opinion that most educated or well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government. This should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough time will tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was  created for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line. That and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented press portrays a group of people as \\\"nuts\\\" or crazies, a violation of those people's civil rights seem justified.   Since we, as American's, have the  gurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the 2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk  voted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with domocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.   Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore the  official press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat to public safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information. So far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very agency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to their advantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If they were portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justification what so ever of doing what they did.    So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny, may mislead the public from the truth of the matter.  Just as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Dalton leads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's (in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to be unconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least). And since, I believe the only reason ATF was involved in this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to  find out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA. It would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly unconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement).    **************************************************************************** The above opinions are mine and mine only.

I've been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties with Christianity. It is surprising to note that a large majority of people, at least in Finland, seem to be apatheists - even though 90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland, religious people are actually a minority.   Could it be possible that many people believe in god \\\"just in case\\\"? It seems people do not want to seek the truth; they fall prey to Pascal's Wager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believe reads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn't care - it believes, but doesn't know what or how.   People don't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle, they only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say that they are not \\\"born in the Spirit\\\", but this does not disturb them. Religion is not something to think about.   I'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless -  a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to. Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop, too many people take the poison with a smile.

In other words Judaism has fathered both religions. Now Islam has turned against its father I may say. It is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone, religion wars are going to be on the raise.  I thought the idea of believing on one God, was to Unite all man kind. How come both Jews and Islam which believe on the same God, \\\"the God of Ebrahim\\\" are killing each other? Is this like Dr. Frankenstien's story? How are you going to stop this from happening? How are you going to deal with so many Muslims. Nuking them  would distroy the whole world? Would God get mad, since you have killed his followers, you believe on the same God, same heaven and the same hell after all? What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga?   Man kind needs religion, since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state. A religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society. The praying, keeps the sole healthy and meditates it. God does not care for man kinds pray, but man kind hopes that God will help him when he prays. Religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life. But the  religious leaders need to make a living through religion? So they  may corrupt it, or turn it to their own way to make their living. i.e Muslims have to pay  %20 percent of their income to the Mullahs. I guess the rabie  gets his cut too!   Is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other, be good toward each other helps one another, respect the mother nature. Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts  that we take today?  Is in it that within every man there is good and bad, he could choose either one, then he will see the outcome of his choice.  How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion. How can we stop another religious killing field, under poor Gods name? What are your thoughts? Do you think man kind would to come its senses, before it is too late?   P.S. on the side  Do you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina? Why would God go to top of the mountain? He created the earth, he could have been anywhere? why on top the mountain? Was it because people thought to see God you have to reach to the skies/heavens? Why God kept coming back to Middle East? Was it because they created God through their imagination?  Is that why Jewish people were told by God, they were the chosen ones?  Profit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh. She was a Jewish. She taught him how to trade. She probably taught him about Judaism. Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah (sp? old testement). Do you think God wrote Quran? Makeh was a trade city before Islam. Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammad wanted to expand his trade business? Is that why  God has put his house in there?   I think this religious stuff has gone too far. All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up. Look at David Koresh, how that turned out?

The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a symbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that the _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar, Relics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real, almost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real sacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking precludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it simply IS holy.  But, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if well- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely to see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which could be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the mass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the real thing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't dare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have been encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing on _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in liturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or the heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita bread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but Catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body.  Modern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We try to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience. It doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the genius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize' is only slightly better.  What are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it doesn't work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well prepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW a matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is the attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative liturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean the Church will be socially conservative.  In NYC I can recommend:  Corpus Christi - W 12st St.  Corpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy,   St. Joseph's, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, \\\"clean\\\", largely gay  Oratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful  Avoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.

Baptism is when we become a member of the church  As for the question of denominations:    A.  The Bible teaches that there is only ONE church from Ephesians 4:4-6, Romans 12:4-5, 1 Corinthians 12:12-13    B.  1 Corinthians 1:10-13 says that there should be no divisions in the church.  There should be no following of personalities in the church (and in time, their writings)    C.  There are so many churches today because of a problem.  2 Timothy 4:1-4 says that people will turn away from the truth and try to find a church that teaches a doctrine that suits their lifestyle  Hebrews 10:24-25    A.  Do not miss church    B.  Purpose is to encourage each other, so we will remain faithful. Involved on a relationship level in the church    C.  Must come to ALL services  Another verse which is helpful is Hebrews 3:12-15.  The church should be encouraging daily, as it is their duty to do.  Of course, more standards apply:    1 Timothy 4:16  People in the church should be watching their lives and doctrines to make sure they both live up to the Word entirely (ie, disciples).    Acts 17:10-12  The pastor does not come close to the Apostle Paul (natural conclusion since the Apostle Paul talked with Jesus directly face to face), so if the Bereans, who were considered noble, didn't take Paul at his word but checked out what he said with Scripture to verify his statements, then church members are to do the same and verify the pastor's statements.  If they are not verifiable or valid in light of other verses, then that group should be avoided as a church (would've made a wonderful suggestion to the Waco group, especially in light of Matthew 24).\",\"[stuff about Dodge Shadow deleted]   What do you mean by \\\"all models\\\", all models of cars, all Chrysler models, all models that the fleet manager had bought?

What's entropy?   * In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?    A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a   decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of   functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of   ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the   decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that   D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption   of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key   (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext   into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to   encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.  * What is an attack?    In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method   of starting with some information about plaintexts and their   corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out   more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state   mathematically what this means. Here we go.    Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,   and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.    An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an   algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that   there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have   f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this   probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).    The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at   least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and   g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible   ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other   words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions   E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).    An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if   n = 2, and so on.  * What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?    In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.   Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this   property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem   is strong!''    In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely   formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is   strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against   all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as   defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this   statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist   any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement   to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that   the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.    Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical   definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions   we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can   figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used   properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.    The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst   can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to   construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,   and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.    * Why is the one-time pad secure?    By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the   plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)   of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive   or) of K and P.    It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial   single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform   distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform   distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack,   i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,   with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and   g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the distribution of   K is uniform and independent of P, the distribution of K + P must also   be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is   uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p   that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus   a fortiori A is trivial.)    On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used   for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial   multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be   thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad'';   this explains the name ``one-time pad.''  * What's a ciphertext-only attack?    In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is   constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about   n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some   information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial   if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given   G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.    For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can   easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply   guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use   the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no   matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which   produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C.   If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is   a nontrivial attack.  * What's a known-plaintext attack?    The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1,   G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2.   In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption   P_1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the   other decryption P_2.    Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature   as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the   cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him   decrypt further messages.  * What's a chosen-plaintext attack?    A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical   series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the   cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into   our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a   chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and   look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured   out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of   attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''    A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption   attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a   way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.    There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks:   for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as   T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew   for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash   function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or.  * In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?    Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some   plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're   also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find   K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).    If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed   on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results   only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial   attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many   possible keys.  * What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?    Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys   randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to   for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which   are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English   words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed, and it's much   faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.\",\" have you tried printing the data file (TIFF) from another application such  as freehand or PageMaker?

Basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling and the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the hot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is rapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently seen rising out of these towers.  That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.  The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference (sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage \\\"hot\\\" turbine to final stage \\\"cold\\\" turbine).

Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically     reduces a woman's chances of getting vaginal candida, a yeast infection.   For the year-long study, researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical     Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recruited 13 women who suffered from  chronic yeast infections. For the first 6 months, the women each day ate 8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second  6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the     women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection  were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.      The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.   It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The    researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some     brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus          thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used   in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a          protective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to   try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists      acidophilus in its contents.                                             --- end ---                                                ===================================  InfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92   THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED   ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS   MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the investigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from any other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been behind it.  What's going on here?  Let's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next. I'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops because I've found some of the techniques to be useful in business negotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR knows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a psychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had professionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior was emminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from civilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their isolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religious orientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as the apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being consumed in the apocalypse.  IMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated psy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of action designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly appearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the tanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations. They KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles, obstensibly to perform \\\"gas insertions\\\" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push him over the edge.  Look at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TV earlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblical role of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno on Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning) claimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true they KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they were pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and reasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at the first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and would have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the \\\"gas insertion\\\" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image that will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back and forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.  Let's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without bloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency interested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation of life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.  The way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back, abandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the armor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited his ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A simple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell how he whipped the US government would have been something he could not have resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the compound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the FBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the revenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without all that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to show the world how big her balls are.  Yesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.

I think basically the reasoning was that the tradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus. As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was more and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin for life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.) Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition because she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When science discovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that Mary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.  Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She  refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old  would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.

It's in the hands of cops, and while I am sure most of the time they are good, their security will not be as good as the escrow houses.

Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are laid?   In many ways, it would be a positive step if they had to. Judges set time limits on warrants, I assume.

But there is NO evidence - pro or con - for the existence or non-existence of God (see what I have to say below on this).   Sorry if I remain skeptical - I don't believe it's entirely a conclusion. That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God is correct - neither have I. But lack of evidence for the existence  of something is in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something  (the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they  disprove evolution the establish creation).

God, however, has no such correspondence with anything (IMO). There is no physical frame work of observation to draw ANY conclusions FROM.      I disagree with you profoundly on this. I haven't defined God as existence - in fact, I haven't defined God. But this might be getting off the subject - although if you think it's relevant we can come back to it.    You are using wrong categories here - or perhaps you misunderstand what I'm saying. I'm making no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there is no fallacy. I'm not trying to convince you of anything. *I* Believe - and that rests upon Faith. And it is inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells you that they can logically prove God or that they have \\\"evidence\\\" or ..., then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).  BTW, an incomplete argument is not a fallacy - some things are not EVEN wrong.    I don't follow you here. Certainly one can make observations of things that they didn't know existed. I still maintain that one cannot use observation to infer that \\\"God does not exist\\\". Such a positive assertion requires a leap.       Once again you seem to completely misunderstand me. I have no EVIDENCE that \\\"'god is' is meaningful\\\" at ANY level. Maybe such a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of God down your throat. I, however, am not doing this. I am arguing one, and only one, thing - that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against requires a leap - it requires faith. I am, as you would say, a \\\"theist\\\"; however, there is a form of atheism that I can respect - but it must be founded upon honesty.     \",\"  In four replies, I've seen no hard numbers, so here goes:  For traces on the outside (not inner layers), expect, in 1 oz copper, at 15 amps, the following temperature rises versus width.  This is from Sams' \\\"Reference Data for Engineers,\\\" seventh edition, Pg 5-30, which claims in turn to be from MIL-STD-275C...      width   Temp rise     inches  degrees C     ------  ---------      .125 100      .15  75      .17  60      .20  45      .24  30      .33  20  At 10 amps, the rise for the .125 width is only about 30 degrees. Power goes as square of the current, plus the copper resistance goes up as temperature goes up...  Certainly .20\\\" (~5mm) traces should be  ample for what you want to do.  And 2 ounce copper almost cuts the  required width in half.  (I'd do 2 oz at about 0.08\\\" width myself,  I think...given that the _rated_ current is 10 amps and the 15 is a transient or fault condition.)\",\"        Two questions:  When was this, and do you have the relevant numbers.  (Please note, this is *not* in any way an indication I don't believe you or that you're not correct, but when the drop occured is relevant.)             The primary objection (beyond ones based on the ideal of RKBA that it is simply not something the government should do) is that it makes guns a play-thing and tool of the rich and connected. It discriminates against the poor.         Is self-defense considered appropriate, and if so, under what conditions?  (Are you allowed, for instance to get a gun for protection if you're going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular basis or have been threatened.)          This has been suggested in the U.S., and generally supported among gun owners.  What many object to is that many, if not most, proposals contain a sort of \\\"gotcha\\\" clause which allows an arbitrary denial, even if you qualify in every way.          At this point, it should be pointed out that in general a driver's licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like its European counterpart.  I understand getting one is far more difficult there than here.  In the U.S. it's a joke.          But my usual objection is that you're discussing two different things.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver's license is a permit to operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary to own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, the ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise from the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations for behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance, which is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get past legally, since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on public property, but in restricting activity on private property.                         This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have a difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions, where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different as from one country in Europe to another).          Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow concealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can be either a state or local restriciton.                 The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual affecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually get is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within this group, here defined as \\\"people who own guns,\\\") are adversely affecting  the rights of some other group.           If for instance, \\\"Bob\\\" were using his gun to attack \\\"Steve,\\\" you'd have a point.  But essentially what we're discussing is that becuase some person who qualifies as a member of the group \\\"people who own guns\\\" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is told that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's rights.  It's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited by one.          The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to what extent guns and gun legislation impact those.          Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn't have to fear that other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us. But currently we don't have that option.  Nor do I expect we will.          No state does.  In any case, there's a limit to which the state may enforce it's \\\"wisdom\\\" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise concept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be \\\"unwise\\\" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept.             I'll raise my hand against driver's licenses.  As currently implemented they're a waste of time and little more than revanue generation for the State and ignored by a startling number of drivers.  It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody else killed, or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year old will have picked up riding around in his parents car.

I had a few thoughts!:  \\\"Faith on its own, if not accompanied by action is dead\\\" - James 2:17  Faith is both belief and action. If I say that I am a great swimmer but I never go swimming, am I really a swimmer? and will people believe that I am? Likewise if I say I'm a Christian but I never talk to God, am I really a Christian? My faith is demonstrated by my action. The fact that we talk to God proves we have faith. Satan believes in God but does not follow Him!  In a similar vein, I have recently been challenged by 1John2:3-6 v3 says \\\"We know that we have come to know Him if we obey His commands\\\" I find this verse quite encouraging as it could imply that 'if we have come to know Him, then we'll obey His commands' cos He lives within us and we cannot help but obey what He says. I tend to feel that as we daily submit ourself to God He will keep changing us into the likeness of Jesus and His fruit and works will be automatically produced in our lives.  Hope this helps.\",\" I don't think such a Canada is any more \\\"culturally similar\\\" to the United States than England. In terms of laws regarding individual rights, restrictions on police searches, etc... (all closely related to crime) Canadian laws parallel England's and differ greatly from those of the United States.     Actually, they do not have \\\"roughly the same... urban economy\\\",  and extremely different ethnic composition.   However, if you account for economic and ethnic differences, the difference disappears completely: Seattle's minorities are predominatly poor, while Vancouver's are middle or upper class. The rates for whites in both cities were found to be identicle, while the rate for poor, Seattle minorities was almost three times as great as for the well-to-do minorities of Vancouver. The pattern seems to be one of poverty and race relations, not one of gun control.   That is a gross distortion: \\\"Self-defense\\\" does not mean killing the attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their  attacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that 0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every case you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence where the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed. (0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure, based on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000 crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other  studies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000. Those figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences involve killing the attacker.)   So, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000)  cases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted in the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, in comparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicides make up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study considered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides prevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not be close to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.\",\"posting for a friend 1982 porsche 928 new this vehicle was $74,000 today book list this vehicle between 11,500 to 15,000 perfect in every way with all options including new paint, leather interior, sunroof and low miles call (408) 264-4444 ask for frank and lets negotiate trades considered \",\"There were a few people who responded to my request for info on treatment for astrocytomas through email, whom I couldn't thank directly because of mail-bouncing probs (Sean, Debra, and Sharon).

Somehow it seems to also apply to the entire physical world as  we know it. LF suggests that God doesn't want that and has sent Koresh  as a reminder.   Seems that those who have been purified through salvation, or that those protected by the Seals, will be the ones who survive.

I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target, then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to harm.  But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph for the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away, heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I saw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this moment is hazy.  I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not. So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!  Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me here, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.  What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?  I eagerly await comment.

EDT              Q   Mr. President, what do you think of Jesse Jackson's  protest today?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's an informational protest.   I think it's fine.  The owners put out a statement few days ago,  which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase  minority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we  should.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado.   And I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's  a legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an  informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to  the game.  So, I think it's good.              Q   Do you think they're moving fast enough?              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first  step.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an  issue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to  give it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will  highlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.              Q   Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate  on the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break  that and get cloture?              THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I  mean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one  of the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you  know, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate  the majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not  like the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they  can stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a  lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote  for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political  pressure not to do it.                And, of course, what it means is that in this time when  no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an  economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're  willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston  and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very  sad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in  a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans  had always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the  program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots  level, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they  have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep  Americans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.

Plus these things have no self- defense purposes.  It's kinda hard to justify their use as a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use (low-yield weapons) or at worst for industrial target obliteration (translation:  cities and population centers).

[Would I kid you?]   Does one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands of individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the Order.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much differently than had one applied them within the confines of their original expression.  I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior  of the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit from Merlinus X' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes to which Order members have been known to go in their fervor. I have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background, but surely he was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order  for many years.  Yet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back so carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed which extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order itself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.   Let us examine this issue a bit more closely....  \\\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist and paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo Templi Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.   Kellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz Hartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together prior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902 in Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death, Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition of the 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught secret of sexual magic.   \\\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in Augsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and possibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist League founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss was later associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden Dawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to found the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several attempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the development of the O.T.O.  \\\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership. For example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin and H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between Reuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and accused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh, the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for the first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all the English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing the material of the Equinox.  \\\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a stroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when _The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break in the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O. over the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order. He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeply infusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\\\"  _An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'  Within _Equinox III:10_, Edited by    Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,     Caliph of the United States of America,       Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.    There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this material in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not? Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own organization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very complex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room for very many interpretations.  It is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived out of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I can take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble support of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.  Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?   Will I?   I think not. Why?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection I am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be quite difficult to apprehend at first.  So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully. I do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assess them, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of the Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then what can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that the Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic requirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?   I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis. They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane or usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.   Having met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or were very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity of the organization as it stands.  I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments  I followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requesting a Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participating in social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic Mass well enough for my tastes.    This doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however. I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my limited contact with other members.  I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many ways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with the Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom and the preservation of individual vision.

Neil Smith                     LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE  [AUTHOR'S NOTE:  \\\"Adrian\\\" -- name changed to protect the guilty --  and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with  the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]  Dear Adrian:    I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to  your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and  generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist  mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back  with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present  now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the  future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.    There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger  of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan.  10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition,  shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic  rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll  limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent  with your note.    First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Second, publication of some latter-day \\\"scientific study\\\" doesn't  alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my  interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.    Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Fourth, as often happens with these things, the \\\"study\\\" doesn't  support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions  anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older  body of lies, omissions, and distortions.    Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on  countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND  BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this  present \\\"study\\\" dubious, to say the least.    Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat  (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you  should be better aware than most people how \\\"progress\\\" -- in  designing \\\"studies\\\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our  ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree  on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30  years to create \\\"studies\\\" \\\"proving\\\" that pornography causes crime.   More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s  clearly indicate the contrary.    Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Tenth, another reason to doubt all such \\\"studies\\\" is that human  behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The  attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the  resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.    Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Twelfth, the \\\"study\\\" is also worthless because it incorporates  figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but  basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social  benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a  criminal offense.    Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials  quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are  many), are correct in this instance:  the \\\"study\\\" is meaningless  because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    And because of that, Adrian, even if the \\\"study\\\" were valid, it  wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that  anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however,  whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's  permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists  themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed  people to go out and buy their first gun \\\"while they still can\\\".   Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the \\\"shooting fraternity\\\"  viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate,  ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in  the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys,  and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we  probably manufacture at least that many every year.  The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly  aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what  their real motives are.    Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way,  it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic;  the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the  self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing  this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a  quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \\\"half life\\\"  of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna  be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.  As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law  provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I  will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is  that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands  -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can  only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given  both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics  and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.

These practices, amply documented in hearings before this Sub- committee, leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregarded rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the United States.    It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise of the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens.    It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search- ing and seizing private property.    It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property without just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with- out regard for their right to due process of law.    The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau was utterly unconvincing. Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of the Treasury Department, asserted vaguely that the Bureau's priorities were aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille- gally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely to be used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recently made great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen- tation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings before BATF's Appropriations Subcommittee, however, expert evidence was submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither criminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into unknowning technical violations.

It has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government which funds ATF, that ATF is one of the most competent and highly professional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government. The agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in successful, legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use of firearms, especially in the area of  drug-related crimes.  It enforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory minimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  an illegal activity.  The Bureau has made itself a key component in preventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-risk youth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known gangs from access to weapons.   The Waco, Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF on the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession (automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombs and other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case, ATF is asked to trace weapons through its' National Firearms Tracing Center, where they keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATF is the Federal governments' firearms expert and routinely works with state and local police to execute warrants.  ATF, working with state and local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys' office felt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally establish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and thorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members of the Branch Davidians.  In addition, ATF carefully selected a Sunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men would be separated from the women and children and not in the area where it was known that the illegal weapons were stored.   As you may be aware by now, Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koresh spiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending execution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately, ATF lost the element of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and prepare for ATFs' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situation presented itself, the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the FBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition, and military tanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and firepower of the Branch Davidians.   Based on what I have learned about ATF's role in the Branch Davidian raid, I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am, however, deeply saddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who attempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the cult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a thorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside the Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for Enforcement.  In addition, ATF will conduct its' own review of the Waco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the evaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick and peaceful conclusion.

Israelis top leaders in the past and present, always come across as arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the Arabs.

Have you ever read Tom Clancy's _The Sum of All Fears_?  It describes in great detail how a Palestinian terrorist group constructed a nuclear bomb using stolen (actually found) plutonium, with some help from an East German nuclear physicist.  For some non fiction, read Tom Clancy's article _Five Minutes Till Midnight_.  It shows how a terrorist group could construct a nuke using Neptunium, a low grade radioactive waste product dumped in toxic waste sites and forgotten about.  He also claims information on constructing a nuke is easily found in any large library.  Sounds kind of scary, doesn't it? :-(    Don't know whether you could get busted for warning of a speedtrap.

I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to   take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive   word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS    netters will be amiable in their explanation.)  Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say \\\"no good\\\" because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not  the authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time  before I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England,  Professor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the  following as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring  1993 edition):    \\\"I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--   or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other    with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian    or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around   a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude   those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central   defining characteristic of a good American might be \\\"one who doesn't draw   exclusive circles\\\" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the    central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to   draw a circle around \\\"Mormon\\\" or \\\"Christian,\\\" to decide who is \\\"orthodox\\\"   and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider   that the central pillar of Christ's \\\"orthodoxy\\\" is our ability to love   unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.    \\\"I recently spent some time in a \\\"Christian\\\" bookstore in California. The   service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and   well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural   commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.   But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking    others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American   culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to \\\"Cults and the   Occult,\\\" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same   rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found   I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers   (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous   anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations   of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).    \\\"It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to   Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (\\\"Perfect   love casteth out fear,\\\" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the   LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a    disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the   same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive   action---as the \\\"religious right wing\\\" has launched this year against the   political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like.   It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the   very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,   if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of   others they believe to be evil.\\\"   The above \\\"sermon\\\" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe to This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His arms.    Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles  of the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim  perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do  now lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled \\\"Christian\\\", if  those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are  intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical  scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication  than mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the  majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective  voice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter  the LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths  and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to  disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves.

What do henrik] want them to do. Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them.  News reports I've seen say otherwise both location and motives wise.   CAPS don't change facts.  BM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment, BM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it BM] is a part of it.    henrik]   Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged  henrik]   training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.  So?  Should I, at this point break into caps and start talking about  DEFENSE etc.?  I don't know how 'fully engaged' Turkey is/was though.  henrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000  henrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the  henrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending  henrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION.   BM] Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them BM]  within their borders?    henrik] Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into  henrik] the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.  So I hear.  This justifies bloodshed N years after the fact?  henrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the  henrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER  henrik] OCCUR again.  BM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?  henrik] It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped henrik] into Armenia if SHE could.  Why would Turkey do that?  Do you not realize that this is a local clash that Turkey never wished to see happen?  Turkey has other plans for region, like economic revival, co-operation etc.  Good stuff in other words,  I'd be happy to bicker with Armenians over trade barriers and such on USENET rather than 'who killed whom in what way' which I detest doing and wouldn't  do.    BM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header BM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?    henrik]    Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many henrik]    cases, HISTORY repeats itself.   Even if one buys into your implicit premise, the sane thing to do would be to try not to provoke Turkey as was done in '74.  If there'd been a democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in Athens at the time, everybody would have stayed home with their families.  [I have no wish to go into the Cyprus quarrel, but I suspect what I've said is not only accurate but also palatable to all parties involved]  BM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes  BM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring BM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians  BM] are attacking Azeri towns.  henrik]    So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey henrik]    wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!  So what do you think we want?  War, death and destruction?    henrik]    I will believe it when I see it.  No, if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it.  henrik]  Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing henrik]to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?   This kind of childish rhetoric doesn't help anthing.  henrik]  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the henrik]  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean henrik]  BURNING people ALIVE !  Now, some Azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff perpetrated by Armenians.  One should re-hash stuff like this often to keep the hatred alive, right?  BM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  BM]futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  BM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  BM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.    henrik]    Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are  henrik]    NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY  henrik]    from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN.   Well they obviously aren't getting anywhere with their current methods of asking (not very peaceful I'd say).  BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent  BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe  BM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better  BM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?  henrik]    Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the henrik]    conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in henrik]    KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.  I don't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans. Peace isn't what's happening right now, furthermore what's happening right now isn't condusive to peace.  You can spend days and nights  raving about how 'right' the Armenian position is and I'm sure there'll be others who'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other side.  If entrenched positions lead to war, and if people want peace than they should sit down and talk about a compromise.  Armenia isn't strong enough to exercise the 'we think we're right, and we have the  bombs, so we'll do whatever we want, so there...' style of foreign  relations.  Yes you can type Stalin in caps, and give one sided atrocity stories etc. but for peace you need to be willing to talk to  the other side.  You personally can choose not to do that of course, this being just USENET.  The people in power shouldn't be so childish.   BM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes BM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of  BM] their blood and future.   henrik]    Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension henrik]    to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH henrik]    are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.

A:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit     all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in     large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,     Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They     are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.     Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other     jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.  Q:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?  A:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,     but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe     to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.     They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently     available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate     more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.     New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected     by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a     detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned     on.  Q:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?  A:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance     computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target     vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR     system.  Q:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be     able to handle it?   A:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US     in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a     low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the     direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the     radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.     Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low     power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar     detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,     although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such     capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use     is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:     learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they     are used (or else, don't speed.)  Q:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?  A:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.     Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.     Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the     military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the     Federal Communications Commission of the USA.  Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:  Q:  What are understeer and oversteer?  A:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a     car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)     Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to     be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they     tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',     or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)     Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that     untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into     trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle     in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance     oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing     throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle     may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or     spinning.      Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car     will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the     angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling     and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to     travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle     than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater     slip angle than the front wheels.  Q: What is a rev-matched downshift?  A: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear    than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally    you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop    rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle    before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to    the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.  Q: What does heel-and-toe mean?  A: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while    braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot    for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you    use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to    match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;    often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side    on the throttle.     Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the    left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing    the same thing.  Q: What is double-clutch downshifting?  A: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of    three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for    declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the    transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with    rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch    engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission    speed up.     The procedure is as follows:    (0) declutch    (1) move gearshift lever to neutral    (2) engage clutch    (3) match revs    (4) declutch    (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear    (6) engage clutch     This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.    The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the    synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or    with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.    Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at    all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good    condition.  Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and    slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?  A: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and    2) almost never.     In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times    in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the    same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine    that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite    pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from    driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*    major) part of the equation.     Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really    only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically    when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the    comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.    This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads    are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply    of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.     Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the    automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced    by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the    car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making    a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end    of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car    has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'    setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of    caveats could go on for page after page.  Q: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according    to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate    or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?  A: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.     2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics    textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,    none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a    stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating    temperature.     Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser    extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a    substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been    coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match    the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire    at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses    inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling    friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire    is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will    be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its    proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some    part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like    to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.    (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal    street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of    high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)     Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,    it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters    accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than    1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible    for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of    grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques    such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.  Misc. Questions:  Q:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?  A:  Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked     about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names     as misinformation abounds on the net.  In particular, NEVER     ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.      Saab:   Svenska Aeroplan A. B.,               or The Swedish Airplane Corporation      Alfa:   Societa Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili,               or The Lombardy Automobile Manufacturing Company      Fiat:   Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino,               or The Italian Automobile Manufacturers of Turin      BMW:    Bayerische Motoren Werke,               or Bavarian Motor Works      MG:     Morris Garage   Q:  Does VW own Porsche?  A:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and     Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,     which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some     financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may     be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this     is only speculation at this time.\",\"  What I did NOT get with my drive (CD300i) is the System Install CD you listed as #1.

BTW, I've heard that the System Install CD can be used to boot the mac; however, my drive will NOT accept a CD caddy is the machine is off.  How can you boot with it then?  --Dave \",\"  Let us not forget the Nazi Armenians. Nazi Armenians were of service  to Germans in Arab countries as well. As Uzun put it, one well-known  case which received a lot of media-coverage involved two Nazi Armenian  agents which were dropped over Syria by Italian war planes. The mission  of the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and  to acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied  forces in the area.[1] Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda  efforts in Arab countries designed to promote pro-Nazi sentiments among  the French- and British-ruled Arab populations. Beirut had traditionally been strong-hold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was the center of international Armenian terrorism.   In Russia General Dro (the Butcher), the architect of the Turkish genocide in WWI, was working closely with the German Secret  Service. He entered the war zone with his own men and acquired important intelligence about the Soviets. His experience with the Turkish genocide in x-Soviet Armenia made him an invaluable  source for the Germans.[2]  [1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., p. 150.

From the discussions I have been in, and from how *I* have interpreted the bible, I feel that one can pray either way.  BUT remember this, before Jesus, the people talked to God (no other way) and he talked  back.  (audible and dreams, etc.)  Today we have the bible to know  Gods will, and we have his son you died for US.  He was given as our savior, and while we still do things according to Gods will, we pray THROUGH his son.  In the bible it says that if we are not known to  Jesus, we are not known to God.  (sorry I do not have the verses with me)  So, if we are to be granted eternal life, we must present ourselves to Jesus first, who will then present us to God.  Leonard    --\",\" Wow.

Oops, maybe not.\",\"Here is a different viewpoint.   In practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed  with inkjet because smudges etc. can happen.   A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of  that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? Inkjets are faster than  you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the  printer. (I have a 486/33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the  printer)  A sage said to me: \\\"Do you want one copy or lots of copies?\\\", \\\"One\\\",  \\\"Inkjet\\\".    Paper cost is the same and both can use refills. Long term the laserprinter  will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that  are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.  HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the  software package has no inkjet driver.   There is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a  page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a  laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers  actually use this facility.

Thanks.  -------------------- Saad Mufti Personal Library Software\",\"I have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires that were on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an owners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are: Front, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and 33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi instead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.  The real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for the front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon Roadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger than that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend, and was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first motorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner tube qualities?  The above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current rear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought 100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be very good at getting close to matching mail order prices.  I am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the front and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer  lasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and FJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive behavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable back end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving much better tire milage life. Any comments?  A friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very good, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to mount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be careful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to check out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and I havn't had a chance to check the rim type.  On another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?) Vetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually I would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be fork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame mounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower bars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition runner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe' style. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is just that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)  -----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------                              edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475                              (208)323-2174   P.O.

Normally, the older boards have a 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char they received. The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer, so - with the right software installed - it generates an IRQ every 16 chars.    If you ran dos, you don't need a 16550, because dos runs only ONE task at a time and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer. But if you are running a multitasking OS such as OS/2, Unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the cpu cannot work the whole time with one task.   The result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.   NO. The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board, whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port which has the UART on board.   I use a Zyxel1496B with a 16550UART under COHERENT 4.0. I'm very satisfied with it but I think that nearly everyone is satisfied with his own modem.

McConkie's views have been controversial (e.g. \\\"The Seven Deadly Heresies\\\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best, or erroneous at worst (\\\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation\\\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations (his book \\\"Mormon Doctrine\\\" is oftentimes referred to as \\\"McConkie's Bible\\\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books! (The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation.

I hear Vida> that pilots and steward/esses have a limit as to the maximum Vida> number of flying hours -- what are these limits?  What are the Vida> main problems associated with too many long-haul (over 4 hours) Vida> trips?  The crew rest requirements are to prevent undue fatigue.  The cockpit crew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew limits for this reason.  Crew rest requirements address amount of time on duty plus rest time.  A tired crew is an accident-prone crew.  The only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in military aircraft, which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably pressurized.  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members DNIF (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear.  Flying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear.  If you don't have big pressure changes, you may not know that you've got a problem.  But if you zip up to 5,000 or 6,000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in an airliner) and then back down to sea level, you may discover a problem. Ears don't clear readily because of allergies, colds, infections, and anatomical problems.  The last won't change; the first three can. Medication (decongestants or antihistimines, usually) can help.

Welbon)]         For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?   There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses word \\\"on faith\\\", we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now. If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods?   The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing, rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?   I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found.\",\" It's my understanding that the next release of UIM/X, due out last February :-) has full support for C++.

Investigation showed that some X servers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window, while others return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. The interesting thing to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware - a Sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are OK, while a Sun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. So far I've also seen this behavior on NCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs.  Actually, the NCD is even more liberal - sizes much larger then the root winodw are gladly returned as OK. Is XQueryBestCursor semi-broken or is this behavior correct?

The Clinton administration  nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever  in regulating cryptography. To do so is tantamount to regulating  `acceptable' speech, and is blatantly unconstitutional. Perhaps we  should rename this year `1984' in honor of such an illustrious  proposal.  Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy, and the adminstration receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure.  I am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures.  The U.S. government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any serious threat to my liberties such as this, and I call on everyone with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this  proposal.  The administration does not seem to understand that they are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the public, and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is  wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty.   It seems to me that U.S. Diplomatic communications should be  tappable by the U.N. whenever any countries produce a warrant to the U.N.  In fact, I think we should stop paying the NSA billions of dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason. These actions violate the sovereignity of international law. (I hope Mr. Clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here. But if he isn't, it's a modest and reasonable proposal, so he should find merit with it nevertheless.)  Cryptography is neutral technology. If everybody has strong  cryptography (including policemen, bureacrats, businessmen,  housewives, thugs and hoodlums), we have a sustainable  equilibrium.  Anything less is an unworkable anti-egaltarian  arrangement, intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms, and guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent  impracticality. We don't need to compromise on issues of freedom.   For too long our government has demonstrated itself to be  increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality  and protecting Americans.   It is not possible for the Federal Government to ``act quickly'' or develop ``consistent, comprehensive policies'' PERIOD.  And even if by some grandiose miracle such a thing were possible, it would only be an efficient way to deprive American citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights.  The administration has to be committed to leaving private  industries alone, esp. on this issue.  The government has no  legitimate role in regulating the content of communications. Law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their surveillance bludgeon; they are soon and inevitably to be  disarmed of it.    No such laws can be constitutionally sound, and this is equivalent to a veiled threat, which I don't appreciate.  This kind of  extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism. I will trade threats for threats, and violation for violation.   If the administration did say this, it would find itself  impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential, established, entrenched, and explicit constitutional privacy  guarantees. The administration would have no legal standing  whatsoever; such an action would be egregiously illegal and criminal, and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast  segments of the population.   The U.S., comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically  committed to preserving their privacy in the face of an  increasingly totalitarian government, is saying just that.   Take your chips and give them to NSA employees as Christmas bonuses. We can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please,  and we will make any chips we please, and we will send any bit  pattern over our data highways we please. And if you try to stop  us, you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness.  [privacy vs. law enforcement]  This is an outright Dingaling Denning lie.  The two aims of privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally  incompatible, and you have to work for the NSA to think otherwise.  Americans are about to discover ways, through the use of technology,  to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly  been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and  *unrepresentative* government.  --\",\"Is CCI still published?

A much more likely explanation is the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because the sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the historical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation images of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of the clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course not.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the anti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or because it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun to represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented, but I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now. -- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com) \",\"Forgive me if this has been asked before... but here goes:  My friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is such a demon called NuBus adapter for his PDS slot?

I expect to have roughly 100 packaged circuits and will do DC, low-speed and high-speed testing using 3 different set-ups for the test chip.     I know for sure that a DIP will not work (the long lead lines have too high an inductance). Getting a custom-made package is too expensive, so I am trying to choose between a flatpak and a leadless chip carrier.

In my encounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth.  According to them, their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of God and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way. Their way is the 'truth.'  But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason, but it seems to me a choice.  My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard discussions when I was in grade school:  A kid would say, \\\"All policemen are jerks!\\\"  I'd ask, \\\"How do you know?\\\"  \\\"Because my daddy told me so!\\\"  \\\"How do you know you're daddy is right?\\\"  \\\"He says he's always right!\\\"  Well the argument usually stops right there.  In the end, aren't we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as false?  -------------  This is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I apologize if I'm covering tired old ground.  Some of the discussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome any comments.  --   [I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.  I can understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough evidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for other religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of intelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But that doesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who believe Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict it are false.  This suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than the Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where people choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent spiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in some unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of one sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But Christianity is in its essense a \\\"historical\\\" religion.  That is, it's based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out there, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways, and that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \\\"mundane\\\" world, we are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it falls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  The Christian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual external reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we have perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know everything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that implies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don't see how else we could proceed.  This needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talking with people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and even if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it's got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some matters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.\",\"Hi, I have a trident TVGA-8900 video card and need the updated drivers for Win3.1 where can I get them from an ftp site.

Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by the Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of the Chruch to do so.  Andy Byler  [You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church establishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based on Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus' teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship occuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more time.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments are right, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.  Accepting the principle of \\\"sola scriptura\\\" does not commit us to obeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quite clear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement is on where the Bible would have us place the line.  By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters that are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free to determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that the Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or (since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to decide.\",\"W >>will NOT do work on internal engine components of the SHO engine.

To paraphrase Hilary Clinton - \\\" I will not raise taxes on       the middle class to pay for my programs \\\"\",\" Where does it say in the bible that Christians are supposed to persecute Jews?  Isn't it love your enemies instead?  They may say they are \\\"Christian\\\" but do their actions speak differently?  Do you believe what everyone tells you?  I don't.  I came to believe in God by my own investigation and conclusions. And ultimately by my own choice.  Salvation, however, was granted only through the grace of God.   To be a Christian is to model oneself after Jesus Christ as implied by the very name Christian.  If you say you believe in your head but do not feel in your heart, what does that say of your belief?   White supremists and Neo-Nazis are NOT any brand of Christian.  \\\"If you hate your whom you can see then how can you love God whom you cannot  see?\\\"  What does this belief entail?  Believing in Christ and having your sins forgiven in His name does NOT give a Christian a free licence to sin.  To repent of a sin is to ask forgiveness of that sin and TRY NOT to do it again.  I am a Christian, but if you lump me in with racists and accuse me of being such, then are you not pre-judging me?  BTW, I am of Chinese racial background and I know what it is to be part of a visible minority in this country.  I don't think that I would be favourably looked upon by these White supremist \\\"Christians\\\" as you call them.  Anyone can say what they believe, but if they don't practice what they preach, then their belief is false.  Do you concur?    Nazis and racists in general are the ones that come to my immediate attention. What I believe is that such people may be using the bible to mask their racial intolerance and bigotry.  They can do as they do and hide behind Christianity but I tell you that Jesus would have nothing to do with them.   No arguement there.   The only point I'm trying to make is that those who call themselves Christian may not be Christian.  I ask that you draw your own conclusions by what they do and what they say.  If they are not modelled after the example of Jesus Christ then they are NOT Christian.  If they have not repented of their sins and accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour then they are  NOT Christian.  These are the only criteria to being a Christian.

The resolution you requested is about 0.3mV In order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower than that.  It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect inside a PC.  Before you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a low distortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD.  Digital Domain ?  There are possibly other low THD sources)  Run the digitized waveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor on the spectrum.  That's should give you a good indication of the design. (That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed - I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet.)  If you can live with 14 bit resolution, I would recommend looking at the MAX121 from MAXIM.  It is a high speed (308KHz) complete sampling A/D with DSP interface.  The input range is +/- 5V and it uses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolated from the computer to elinimate a major noise source)  The Analog design guide I got from them shows a -100db noise level.  They claim a -77db max (-85 typ.) THD.  Looks pretty good for the $12 @ 1000 pieces  A evaluation kit is available.  Might want to give these nice folks a call.  1-800-998-8800 or fax: (408)737-7194 and (408) 737-7600 ext4000 for application assistance.  This assumes that you can build your own DAS and write your own software. (Hey you can get the MAX121 as a free sample just by calling the 1-800 #)   I would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out of your system by looking at the noise level, otherwise you might be throwing out your money.

One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader. \\\"What could be better,\\\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging?      \\\"It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,\\\" announced Ryne Sandberg.  \\\"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to win.      \\\"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\\\"      The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.      Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center.  \\\"Cool Papa\\\" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone grounded out to second, ending the threat.        \\\"Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\\\"  So came the analysis from Frank Chance.      The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs, Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense. He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.      Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph.      Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st      Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday. The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of first in this wacky season.      Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2 Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday. The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3-2.  \\\"We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed,\\\" remarked Lou Brock.  \\\"I don't see why we can't win this division.\\\"      The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first. -------------------------------------------------------------------      New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs, now 2 back - but in 4th!     \\\"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a pitcher's park like this,\\\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith Hernandez added that \\\"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year, and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\\\"  The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.      Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the .500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins, and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go. ------------------------------------------------------------------      San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5):      Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw, \\\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\\\"      Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13. Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the National League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace. They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.      In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score. The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely. -------------------------------------------------------------------      San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the trade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.      Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after 10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home, and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):      Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \\\"Normally,\\\" Drysdale remarked, \\\"I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't Davis will get decked once.\\\"      The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away, with center field at 420 feet.  \\\"It's as if some three-year-old threw a tantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit home runs',\\\" remarked Roy Campanella.      The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway, Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings, according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the Astros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent. Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.      \\\"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\\\" he explained.      \\\"How can we do that,\\\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.      \\\"They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time.\\\"      The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.      \\\"We're mostly a power team,\\\" remarked Ron Cey.  \\\"Jackie and, when he plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other plays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I guess that's why they're so successful there.\\\"  Indeed, it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.

The Masons have been demonized and harrassed by almost  every major Xian church there is.  For centuries now.  And still they  stand.  They wil withstand the miserable Southern Boobtists, I am sure. They may even pick up a little support as people start to listen to the  Boobtists and realize that subtracting the obvious lies and claims of  Satanism that the Masons sound pretty good by comparison.  One thing is  known.  A sizable proportion of Southern Babtists are Masons!  And the  Masons have already fired back in their own magazines against the  Boobtist Witch-hunt.   Since the Consrervatives have already been a divisive element with  their war on Boobtist moderates and liberals, they may now start in on  their Mason/Boobtist brothers and hasten their own downfall as more and  more Southern Boobtists realize their church can't stand being run by a  handful of clowns looking for holy civil wars and purity tests and drop  'em out of the leadership positions they have taken over.

I knew about this previously, but this past weekend on PBS's MotorWeek Pat Goss  (their resident tech type) discussed these products, and recommends not using them (i.e, the non-isopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners).  Supposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture from your fuel tank as they clean your injectors.  And although the  others (ethyl based) do clean injectors they also cause rubber  components in the fuel system to deteriorate, and they don't mix well with water to help remove it from the fuel system.  I use a product recommended by VW called 44K (by BG Products, Inc.).

The 27th was a short day at work, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided to go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes behind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24 Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the  car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit, and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and  her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to  45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help them. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?  When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was,  but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the  Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle around it. I ask, \\\"What's going on?\\\" Someone tells me, \\\"Come listen.\\\" Well they were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \\\"Brother Muslims, our time has come . . . \\\" and something else along that line. I didn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to  get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter.  New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And the comments started: \\\"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"There's no need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\\\" I even heard that: \\\"All  Moscow is behind us.\\\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this  was no joke. I quietly left and went home.  Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh,  that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of  things, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.  My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku.  I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and  shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly, like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a  demonstration and move slowly.  My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd people are shouting \\\"Down with the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"Death to the Armenians!\\\" I waited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street  on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned  and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26  Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there  was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same  kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside  from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.  My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of uneasy and said, \\\"No, let's stay at home instead.\\\" An hour went by, or maybe  an hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say exactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on the side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.  I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside, and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time  there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more  aggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration. They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run  again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I  followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was  leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one  side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square  and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There  was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals. I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \\\"We don't need  perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\\\" Now what did they  mean by \\\"living like we have been?\\\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else.  But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense  of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just  in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it  anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.  Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians'  apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't  hear them say \\\"kill them\\\" over the microphone, I only heard \\\"beat them and  drive them out.\\\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then another are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and  I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB. There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try  to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.  Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no demonstration, and I had to protect my family.  I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next to the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai- lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some- thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City  Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I  saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the  cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15  to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried  off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe  about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha.  When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was  about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He  has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I  have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of  people smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled  around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.  Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting.  I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am,  I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags.  And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the  street. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag,  which had \\\"Ermeni oryum\\\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \\\"Death to  Armenians!\\\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really know what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is Rafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark blue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His  family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on  Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars;  their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the  left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a  new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son  was carrying a flag that said \\\"Death to Armenians!\\\" I was surprised because  before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being  done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.  Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \\\"It's OK, it'll pass,  they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up.\\\" Naturally I didn't  want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And  this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't  see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't  handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking  and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and  hashish to put in a store window!  So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one  would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again,  the police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't  breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time.  True, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much- vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people  died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I  couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be  specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of  Sumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.  When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \\\"Let's go upstairs.\\\"  We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the  evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more. I stopped at \\\"The Corner,\\\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I  look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to  the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old.  The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed  toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person,  wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as  though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more  noise, and the glass was flying again.  We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor, there was really no way to defend yourself there.  In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town.  On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or  what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the  bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying  there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing you couldn't even see him.  That was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.

Caratzas, NY, pages 161-164  \",\" At issue was not a trial behind closed doors, but arrest, trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy.  This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason to believe it still goes on.  Read this:  From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992  PUBLICATION BAN          The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many         years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were         sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of         their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever         being made public.  By Baruch Me'iri  All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way or another: \\\"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published\\\".  The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest, and later on their imprisonment.  In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of this country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison, for security offenses, in complete secrecy.  In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA] affair -- we heard about \\\"the third man\\\" being in prison.  But many years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former Communist countries.  But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.  The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:  \\\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner\\\", asserts MK Zucker.  On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \\\"There is absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public.  \\\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\\\"  Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question.  \\\"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret\\\", wrote Zucker.  The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that, \\\"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter\\\".  \\\"The Union is aware\\\", says Shiffman, \\\"of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.  \\\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy...\\\"  Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible.  \\\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it.\\\"  -- Do you find this situation acceptable?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand, though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least are aware of his imprisonment.\\\"  -- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the discretion of the court?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which they can misuse.\\\"  -- And what if there really is a security issue?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.  Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public.\\\"  Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  \\\"A healthy situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security\\\".  A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir.  \\\"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.  \\\"Nevertheless\\\", adds Shtendal, \\\"the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned. The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\\\"  Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \\\"As a rule, clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances.\\\"\",\"   What is happening is this: 1) You turn the TV on. 2) The horizontal output begins normal operation.

The recent discussion about atheists and hell, combined with a post to another group (to the effect of 'you will all go to hell') has me interested in the consensus  as to how a god might judge men.  As a catholic, I was told that a jew, buddhist, etc. might go to heaven, but obviously some people do not believe this.  Even more see atheists and pagans (I assume I would be  lumped into this category) to be hellbound.

We interviewed a young doctor last week and were very impressed with her.  However, I discovered that she is actually not an Medical Doctor (M.D.) but rather a \\\"Doctor of  Osteopathy\\\" (D.O.).  What's the difference?  I believe the pediatrician *I* went to for many years was a D.O. and he didn't seem different from any other doctor I've seen over the years.  My dictionary says that osteopathy is \\\"a medical therapy that emphasizes manipulative techniques for correcting somatic abnormalities thought to cause disease and inhibit recovery.\\\"  Jeez, this sounds like chiropractic.  I remember getting shots and medicine from *my* pediatrician D.O., and don't remember any  \\\"manipulative techniques\\\".  Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to the real, practical difference between an M.D. and a D.O.  Also, I'm interesting in hearing any opinions on choosing a pediatrician who follows one or the other medical philosophy.  Readers of sci.med:  Please respond directly to sbrenner@attmail.com; I do not read this group regularly and probably won't see your response if you just post it here.

There is no Open entry on the File menu. You can only edit these four files. If you need to edit some other program's .ini file, use Notepad or some other ASCII editor.  I wonder whether Microsoft intended for sysedit to be used, or if it was just a holdover from the testing period and they forgot to take it out. The reason I think this is because there is absolutely no mention in the manuals about this program, and there is no online help for it (just an About entry under the File menu). The program looks like something that was intended for internal use only. It's kind of a shame, though.

Jordan Water to the Negev: A Strategic Asset XI.     The Negev Becomes a Dumping Ground XII.   The Dimona Nuclear Plant XIII.  The Negev as a Military Base XIV.  The Negev in the Year 2000  Just after the creation of the State of Israel, the phrase \\\"the Jewish pioneers will make the desert bloom\\\" was trumpeted throughout the Western world. After the Six Day War in 1967, David Ben-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle: \\\"It's by our pioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land into a fertile land, created built-up areas, towns and villages in abandoned desert areas\\\".  Contrary to Ben-Gurion's assertion, it must be affirmed that during the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and for centuries previous, a productive human presence was to be found in all parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleys of the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north. These were the Bedouin Arabs.  The real desertification of the Negev, mainly in the southern part, occurred after Israel's dispossession of the Bedouin's cultivated lands and pastures. Nowadays, the majority of the 12,800 square-kilometer Negev, which represents 62 percent of the State of Israel (pre-1967 borders), has been desertified beyond recognition. The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev are the Israeli army; the Nature Reserves Authority, whose chief role is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture lands; and vast industrial zones, including nuclear reactors and dumping grounds for chemical, nuclear and other wastes. Israeli Jews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area cultivated by the Bedouin before 1948, and there is no Jewish pastoral activity.  I. Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin before and after 1948 -------------------------------------------------- In 1942, according to British mandatory statistics, the Beersheba sub-district (which corresponds more or less to Israel's Negev, or Southern, district) had 52,000 inhabitants, almost all Bedouin Arabs, who held 11,500 camels, 6,000 cows and oxen, 42,000 sheep and 22,000 goats.  The majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in the north, where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm per year. In 1944 they cultivated about 200,000 hectares of the Beersheba district - i.e. 16 percent of its total area and *more than double the area cultivated by the Negev's Jewish settlers after 40 years of \\\"making the desert bloom\\\"*  The Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms of barley per hectare during rainy years - and their farming techniques were primitive, but production was based solely on animal and human labor. It must also be underscored that animal production, although low, was based entirely on pasturing. Production increased considerably during the rainy years and diminished significantly during drought years. All Bedouin pasture animals - goats, camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weight quickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many waterless days during the hot summers. These animals were the result of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harsh local conditions.  After the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The 10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of 40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150 mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out of three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev, spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin shepherds from roaming.  A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev. But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields in order that the land could be transferred to the army.  No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized by the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now confined to seven \\\"development towns\\\", or *sowetos*, established for them.\",\"  The yearly chest x-ray provides a minute amount of radiation.
