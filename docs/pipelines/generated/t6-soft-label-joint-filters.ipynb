First, I recommend the Sony CPD-1320 monitor.  It is a 14\\\" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed specifically for use with the LC.  It works only with Macs with specific video capabilities which means only the LC's and anything after the ci.  All it takes is a MAC<->VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which is about $20).  These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of comparable monitors because they are not multisynch.  I have used one for half a year and I love it.   Second, I have used Syex and found them to be decent.  I had a backorder on a Supra modem which I cancelled.  They were helpful in explaining the reasons why there were delays and they had Supra's number ready for me.  The only complaint was that they did not always return my calls.   I have been told that the CPD-1320 is selling for $339 from J&R's (800)221-8180.  I think Syex is a little more, but I don't know.  -David\",\"For sale:  NEC TurboGrafx-16 video game system.

Excuse me?   \\\"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as    ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work    of extermination.

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They    found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border    into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole    length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to    Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain    plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of    Tartar villages.

A genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an  attempt to exterminate a race. This is the worst crime in history.  It happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian  dictatorship. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst  ways imaginable. It is sickening to think that the human race is capable  of such actions, but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian  genocide of 2.5 million Muslims happened.  People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were  killed in the Turkish genocide. I understand their anger that there  are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place,  despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million Turks has been  well documented over the past six decades. We cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race.

Mark Alan Epstein, 'The Ottoman Jewish Communities and their Role   in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries,' Klaus Schwarz Werlag,   Freiburg (1980).    page 19:   <<During the fifteenth century, when the Ottomans were struggling to   reestablish themselves in the Balkans, there was considerable turmoil   among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe. Even if   the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the   fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which   Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the   Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the   realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution   in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews   fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that   the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that   there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and   eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the   effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and   persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection   of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,   was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>>     page 21:    <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official   in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi   Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and   the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation   of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from   Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two   recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom   of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European   coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.   This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant   conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of   travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who   would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*)     page 41:   <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were  firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them  and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians  of Europe.   Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is  also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews  as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.  Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians  representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European  sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition  it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,''  their  sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who  regularly reported to the Ottomans.   There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans  in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances  of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited  instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the  early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy  for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman  document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some  Greek towns...>>   page 43:    <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally  accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,  and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of  the situation.>>    page 46:   <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not  particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common  interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition  which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If  there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between  religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was  that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with  the Orthodox.>>   page 46:   <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context  during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of  interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed  Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already  existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish  response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian  countries to Ottoman domains.>>   page 151:    <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the   Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would   characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,   in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and   the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions   elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the   Jews recognized their mutual interests...>>    page 161:    <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success   of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success   in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both   cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough   to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success   without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve   the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear   that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable   partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived.   We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their   success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the   Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries   the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>>   (*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati's [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw:    page 32:    <<Your cries and sobs reached us. We have been told of all the troubles   and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear   the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly   oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and   prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob   and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They   wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren, to the counsel I will   give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German   rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land,   which is blessed by God and filled with all good things. Here I found rest   and happiness; Turkey can also become for you the land of peace...If you   who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with   in this land, you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out   to come to us...Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain   of. We possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. We are   not oppressed with heavy taxes, and our commerce is free and unhindered.   Rich are the fruits of the earth. Everything is cheap, and every one of us   lives in peace and freedom. Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow   hat as a badge of shame, as is the case in Germany, where even wealth and   great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy   among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him   to rob him of his gold. Arise my brethren, gird up your loins, collect   your forces, and come to us. Here you will be free of your enemies, here   you will find rest...>>[13]  [13] Israel Zinberg, A History Of Jewish Literature. vol.V.

I can't : see it having trouble keeping up.  His pcplus for dos works great,  re: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93  This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2 or DOS apps not running under Windows.  One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that their RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST) discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or FAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer than with the old 2400bps modem.   There are three reasons for the problem:  1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most    PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the    operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high    interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and    the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded    environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.  2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and    interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely    than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you    are losing data, you may be advised that \\\"you need to upgrade to a    16550\\\". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance    about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the    store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve    my own problem had never heard the term \\\"16550\\\" and many didn't even    know what a UART was.  3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade    your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience    errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers    don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this    regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications    like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem    by themselves.  If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem card.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they are to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one. Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.   The Hardware Situation.  The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250 or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace them).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft diagnostic program \\\\WINDOWS\\\\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before* bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.  The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to 460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access cycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info, see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.  So, what UART component do you have?  Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM board or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with the numbers \\\"8250\\\" or \\\"16450\\\", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI, and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE your VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket COM board.  If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The \\\"N\\\" chip is the normal 40-pin dual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550 chips without the \\\"A\\\" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).  Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various IC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips: National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552 Chips&Technology:       82C607 Texas Instruments:      t16c550a Silicon Systems:        73M550 VLSI                    16C550 TurboCom warns about the pre-\\\"A\\\" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550, says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70 systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).  If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after- market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you may be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to either disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to COM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).  Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology MCT-AIO+ card from:  JDR Microdevices 2233 Samaritan Drive San Jose  CA  95124 (800) 538-5000 voice US (408) 559-1200 voice other (800) 538-5005 FAX US  The MCT-AIO+ (and the \\\"+\\\" is important) sells for $89.95.

Meanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports, and am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based 8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set the internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.   The Software Situation  Simply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun problems.  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the 16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1 drivers have the following limitations:  - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.  - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt    rate of 10x during uploads.  - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2    more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).  - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.    With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1    or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would    be effective.  - The API won't accept rates above \\\"CBR_128000\\\".  - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even    if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit    from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.  - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.  - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.  - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port    speed options above 19200 bps.  These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0). Rumors suggest they \\\"may\\\" be solved in Windows \\\"4.0\\\".  You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of \\\"TurboCom\\\", current version 1.2, from:  Bio-Engineering Research Pacific CommWare Division 180 Beacon Hill Lane Ashland  OR   97520-9701 (503) 482-2744 voice (503) 482-2627 FAX (503) 482-2633 BBS MCImail:    344-5374 CompuServe: 71521,760  Price was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit cards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom but as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software company per se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for an in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a market for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They recently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.  I now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my datacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps when linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O. Uploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts are still using antique UARTs and drivers.  Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the Windows APIs and dialog boxes.  I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you do the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC) standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another 16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving system or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all by itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above 115,200 may still be risky.  Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to buy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a 16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of TurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of \\\"Windows Sources\\\" magazine. I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a \\\"power user\\\" whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems.   Closing Soapbox Comments  The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface, the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation vendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was subsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the exception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent I/O.  You may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this situation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect cries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs \\\"sort of\\\" work today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a hardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that use that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.

Either they are believing and living (in at least some part) led by God, else  they are not.  Believing (intellectually, but waiting(?)) is not enough.    Especially important to remember is that no one can judge whether you are  so committed, nor can you judge someone else.  I guess the closest we can  come to know someone's situation is listening to their own statements.  This  can be fallible, as is our sense of communion one with another.   Regarding this passage, we need to remember that this is a letter to a church  (at Laodicea), people who are Of the Body of Christ. (Rev.3:14-16)  He talks  about their works.  A translation could say that he says their lack of  concern makes him sick (to the point of throwing up).     Right, saving is by faith alone, except that faith does not come alone, if  you catch the two meanings.    I can offer the explanation that Jesus would that we were either \\\"on fire  for Him\\\" or so cold we knew we were not in His will and thus could be made  aware of our separation.  This is admonishment for His children, not eternal  damnation.  \",\"  Circuit Cellar Inc. 4 Park St.  Suite 20 Vernon, CT  06066 (203)875-2751\",\"Farewell, Minnesota fans.

Unfortunately, it shows that Lopez wasn't as good an example as Nieves would have been, since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous years (which I didn't have access to).  The point remains, though; knowing a guy's minor league history is as good as knowing his major league history, if you know how to read it.   The MLE is not a *projection*, it's an *equivalence*.  It's a \\\"this is how well he hit *last* year, in major league terms\\\" rating.  So, in essence, he has *already* reached it.  I would guess (Bob?  Clay?) that essentially half of all players surpass their previous MLEs in their rookie seasons.  Maybe more than half, since all of these players are young and improving.   Did they?  Offerman may have been the difference between 4th or 5th place and last place, but no more.   Sure; they didn't have anyone better.

My apology.     (Deletion)     So? No fun, but I must have met the minority then. And \\\"given by god\\\" refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something.     Rob, I am not intimate with Jewish theology, but I understand that you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god views, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute evil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.     (Deletion)   The context was metaphysics, even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent, the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion. I wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system.     (Deletion)   Is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds. The context is repulsive, and it is foul play, IMO, to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book.     (Big deletion)   No, not the interpretation of some laws, but the interpretation of the bible. As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue with god. The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo- logic question) is proof of a theology used.       It is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection between the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of it, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better. You might answer that one can't becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but that holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place? Can't it be replaced somehow? Is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other message that is included as well?     (Deletion)   Sorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system.   (Deletion)   If we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?     And the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it can be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way, and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god.\",\"While there are too many PS clones to count, some of which are quite poor, trying to clone something that goes through regular modifications does require some patience. Three questions come to mid real quick for something like this.  Q: Which version of Adobe PS will we clone?  Aside from the level 1 and level 2 issues, Adobe has in the past released  new code that incorporates modifications/upgrades/fixes just as all other  software vendors do. The level 2 stuff may seem sound now, but I assure  you,changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to  dwindle in the face of competition. This allows them to shift people to  maintenance, as well as design efforts for level 3.  Q: Do we duplicate the bugs, or do we make it work correctly?  From the LaserWriter to the LaserJet 4 there have been bugs. (If I had  a number to call at HP or Adobe, they'ld have heard from me.) Deciding  which approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate.  Q: Do we follow the Red Book, or do we follow someone's implementation?  Without a doubt, there are differences between the Red Book and Adobe's  PS. With level 2 many issues have been refined but the Red Book does  leave big, big holes in the implementation specific stuff. It would be  nice it the Red Bood at least pined things down enough so that two  different implementations of Adobe's PS don't do the exact opposite given  an identical set of conditions.  Q: PSCRIPT.DRV?  Having done a lot of PS clone testing myself, the unfortunate side of  testing is the limited number of sources for test files. The primary  source we use is Genoa. And having characterizes their 1992 PS ATS files,  (1300+ of them) over half are taken from PSCRIPT.DRV. It may not ideal,  but the ATS files are what the printer vendors use. I'm sure that Adobe  uses them too, but Adobe's output is by definition correct, even if its  wrong.  Yes, there are some very poor clones. We've seen them here at Rastek (a sub of Genicom which has its own clone called GeniScript). Some are poor for lack of design, some are poor because they followed the Red Book, and some are poor because the vendors don't know what PS is.\",\"    SEI Level 5 (the highest level -- the SEI stands for Software Engineering Institute).  I'm not sure, but I believe that this rating only applies to the flight software.  Also keep in mind that it was *not* achieved through the use of sophisticated tools, but rather through a 'brute force and ignorance' attack on the problem during the Challenger standdown - they simply threw hundreds of people at it and did the whole process by hand.  I would not consider receiving a 'Warning' status on systems which are not yet in use would detract much (if anything) from such a rating -- I'll have to get the latest copy of the guidelines to make sure (they just issued new ones, I think).  Also keep in mind that the SEI levels are concerned primarily with control of the software process; the assumption is that a well controlled process will produce good software.  Also keep in mind that SEI Level 5 is DAMNED HARD.  Most software in this country is produced by 'engineering practicies' that only rate an SEI Level 1 (if that).   --  \\\"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live  in the real world.\\\"   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden\",\"I am working on a program to display 3d wireframe models with the user being able to arbitrarily change any of the viewing parameters.

It is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normal civlized life. They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967 without civil and political rights.   It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country, Palestine. Gaza is not a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreign country for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians are concerned and as far as common sense has it.   It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens and the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists will begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same rights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.  Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel is entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should be entitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel to enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master and slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.  To close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistence and means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a crime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss  to which Israeli society has degraded.   I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain why Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return and live there ? Would they be allowed to, if they converted to Judaism ? Is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their religion or ethnic origin ?

But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only \\\"real solution\\\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both  legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the \\\"internal nerves\\\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd  always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that \\\"force\\\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.  Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\",\" Yes, Fred, my heart and prayers go out to the mother and others who have  been victims of these and other senseless crimes.

I got it from a The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the editor.       Saint Aloysius Gonzaga      The Patron of Youth       The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince     Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured     soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of     Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and     honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in     the manner expected.      Saint Aloysius' mother was a woman who received immense joy  from     praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the     life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this     life.  As  Saint  Aloysius grew, he began to resemble his mother     more than his father.      Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father's     soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he     fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an     example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).      About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received     from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself     became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and     asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.      He wanted to share Our Lord's suffering to show  his  reciprocal     love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the     finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of     wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.     While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his     younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.     Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well     with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,     intelligent and always had something interesting to say.       Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint Igna-     tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)     towards which Saint Aloysius         -12-            began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the     marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.      After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in     order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even      through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the     religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.      The Marquis' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his     son:  \\\"Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-     ness?\\\" \\\"I will not, father,\\\" was the  in-evitable  reply. \\\"Then     leave from my sight and don't return until you change your mind!\\\"     With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to pray:     \\\"Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!\\\" He knelt down     to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but     this  time he was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This     at last brought the proud man to his senses. \\\"The Lord wants him,     the Lord can have him.\\\" He gave his consent for his son to become     a Jesuit.      After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-     ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and     could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy-     sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare     the dying for a holy death.      Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from carrying  and     nursing  the  sick.  For three months he lay with a burning fever     and finally, on June 21st, 1591, he gave his  soul to  the  Lord     while gazing at a crucifix.      Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his     humility, purity and confidence in prayer.      Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, pray for us.      - Brendan Arthur           Prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service  of     others as a sword is to a soldier  God Bless  From Simon Lines:  106\",\"To Mr. Millitello -   Listen, Sammy, can you explain why Buck pitched you in relief yesterday?

To summarize:    SPACE ADVERTISING     First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very common practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the space launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the (very prominent) logos on its side of    - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)    - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)    - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and    - the GPS/Navstar program office    This has not been considered \\\"paid advertising\\\" but rather \\\"public relations\\\", since the restrictions have been such that only organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the side, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting a 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras is \\\"advertising\\\" as much as it is \\\"public relations\\\", in my opinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]    There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials for use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large advertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of several serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at putting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload bay.  These ventures would be different than \\\"public relations\\\", in that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms participating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For example, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras would scan past it.)    ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES    The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about 1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe company was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly, Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last Olympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from participating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for example, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the British visiting cosmonaut to Mir.    Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch vehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements on the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie \\\"The Last Action Hero\\\".  Besides the usual logos of the participating organizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the main fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its booster rockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for one month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in Space News magazine a couple of months ago.    (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is talking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the space program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on the upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it \\\"would not use his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and receiving compensation.\\\"   This is being disputed, since the launch is a \\\"commercial launch\\\" and NASA is receiving none of the advertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is coming from NASA.)    ORBITAL \\\"BILLBOARDS\\\"    Orbital \\\"billboards\\\" have been the staple of science fiction for some time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert Heinlein described another in \\\"The Man Who Sold the Moon\\\".  Several different potential projects have been developed, although none have been implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the \\\"Eiffel II\\\" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in orbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.

Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your    body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.  2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the    current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you    are thrown out of the game, and fined.  3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot    is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.  Besides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties in a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one, until the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured.  This works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most exciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better. Next, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can take a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network announcers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and Marv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before the PA announcer says it.  Oh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play cannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network can sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told them who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a  chance of pronouncing his name right.  Seriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week, for the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting contests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their  routines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods either. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The game is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a 10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.  The reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in commercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening. On TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch it on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then it truly is a sad day.

Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was   trying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210   and my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need   to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe   place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is   that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it   wrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this   could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.    It could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one   wrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further   correct actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also   my NeXT that way.  Now I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any   problem, and at pretty high speeds too.  I don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is   pretty standard.\",\"              ...   Why do you say this?  As of now, the Pens and Bruins have played the same number of games, and given up the same number of goals.  They are tied for the third and fourth best defenses in the league, behind Chicago first and Toronto second.  The Pens' weak spot is defense?  Only by comparison to their offense, which is second in the league to Detroit.  But the Pens are no weaker on defense and goaltending than the Bruins are; that is, they are both very strong.  \",\"A co-worker of mine needs to convert a postscript file to a form readable (ie ascii) in windows or DOS.

From  the writings  of tye biographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe chauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian genes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian, she   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong characteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian ancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian from  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant Thedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady Diana. It is noteworthy  that Eliza Kewark was also referred  to as  Mrs. Forbesian  (a characteristic Armenian  surname  ending).  An  Armenian-Scottish gene mix is dynamite.  Levon K. Topuzian Assistant Professor Northwestern University Skoie, Illinois.  TIME, December 21, 1992 'Letters'   You have set up straw horses and knocked them down. I'm not impressed. Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.   Source: Stanford J. Shaw, on Armenian collaboration with invading Russian armies in 1914, \\\"History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey (Volume II: Reform, Revolution & Republic: The Rise of Modern Turkey, 1808-1975).\\\" (London, Cambridge University Press 1977). pp. 315-316.  \\\"In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city   of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population,   closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan   on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized   and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during   the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the  southern side of the lake.\\\"  \\\"Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,  Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.  Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First  World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse  to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other  invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian  success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of  Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common  soldiers began deserting in droves.\\\"  \\\"With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of  World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy  increased drastically.

Then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the faces sharing a given edge (where an edge is two integers representing the two shared vertices).  Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE.  Using the edge dictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of this face.  And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistently orienting the entire surface.  Find the average of the vertices in this surface.  Using that point, calculate a volume measurement, taking into account the face's orientation.  If the volume turns out to be positive, assume the faces are oriented correctly.  If it is negative, reverse their orientations (mark them CLOCKWISE).  If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this, choose another face and go through the algorithm again.  At the end, faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversed before facet normals are found.

INCREDIBLY CHOPPED UP POST I won't even try to tell you where the deletions came out    I find that I am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can manufacture for ourselves.  Little in the cosmic sense.  Even the greatest of the great pharos are long gone, the pyramids historical oddities being worn down by the wind, eventually to be turned into dust. Mankind itself will one day perish.  Without some interconnectedness that transcends the physical, without God, it is all pointless in the end.  Most people are able to live with that, and for them little purposes (success, money, power, effecting change, helping others) suffice.  I suppose they never  think about the cosmic scale, or are at least able to put it out of their minds.  To me, it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion.  That the true reality underneath the the physical is spirit.  That this world is a school of sorts, where we learn and grow, and our souls mature.  That gives a purpose to my little purposes, and takes some of the pressure off.  It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms if you're really just here to learn.  It's more important to progress, grow, persist, to learn to love yourself and others and to express your love, especially when it's dificult to do so.  Honest effort is rewarded by God, he knows our limitations.    Interesting theological question.  I have a feeling that most common perception of eternal life is WAY off base.  If I were to be imprisoned in the limited ego/mind I am in now I doubt I would choose imortality.  It would get awfully boring.    TWO SERIOUS QUESTIONS/INVITATIONS TO DISCUSSION 1. What is the nature of eternal life? 2. How can we as mortals locked into space time conceive of it?\",\" Mel Hall signed with a Japanese team. \",\"     Geez, where have you been, Ryan?  I proposed this theory *months* ago.  Let's take it one step further, even.  If, as the surveys show, up to 33% of all men have *had* a homosexual encounter, then there must be an even *larger* percentage of people who have had homosexual erotic fantasies.  But if less than 10% of the population is gay, what can we say about these people who don't identify as gay but have demonstrated gay potential.  Obviously, a large chunk of these people *chose* (or, more accurately, were forced to choose by force of religion and social sanction) to put those feelings aside, to be heterosexual.     Obviously, Cramer and Kaldis fall into this category.     These people are the ones who are so hung up on \\\"choice.\\\" Obviously, since *they chose*, everyone must have, and homosexuals are just flaunting their \\\"perversion\\\" by choosing not to go along with what society has dictated.     Of course, I'm that most awful of perverts.  I chose, I gleefully admit that I was heterosexual until I met the right man and *chose* to indulge in my homoerotic potential.  Take that!

The intersection of 3 planes method looks best, but my implementation based on a short article in  Graphics Gems I doesn't work.  I may be misinterpreting, of course.  I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better.  In either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solution of linear equations).  To get the planes, I was taking the midpoint of the line from, say, P1 to P2, and setting the normal as the \\\"normalized\\\" vector from P1 to P2. These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.  HOwever, the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points (for different tests).  My matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks like I need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, which will require bringing in another routine I don't have (but should be easy to find).  Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets of 3 points, and intersecting the normals from there.  This would also define the circle center.  However, small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not intersect.  Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a unique point if they are not parallel.

 : I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of : the world  if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group : of the population.   I've been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties with Christianity. It is surprising to note that a large majority of people, at least in Finland, seem to be apatheists - even though 90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland, religious people are actually a minority.   Could it be possible that many people believe in god \\\"just in case\\\"? It seems people do not want to seek the truth; they fall prey to Pascal's Wager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believe reads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn't care - it believes, but doesn't know what or how.   People don't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle, they only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say that they are not \\\"born in the Spirit\\\", but this does not disturb them. Religion is not something to think about.   I'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless -  a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to. Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop, too many people take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow (and unconsciously hope god wouldn't notice ;-) )  : Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a : higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The : typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the : same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the : other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn : somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core, : than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it : expresses its own selfishness.  If logic and reason are valued, then I would claim that atheistic thinking is of higher value than the theistic exposition. Theists make unnecessary assumptions they believe in - I've yet to see good reasons to believe in gods, or to take a leap of faith at all. A revelation would do.  However, why do we value logic and reasoning? This questions bears some resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science: why mathematics works? Strong deep structuralists, like Atkins, have proposed that perhaps, after all, everything _is_ mathematics.   Is usefulness any criterion?  Petri \",\" This must have been in the works for some time.  The Bush administration must have been working on it for quite a while.  --Clinton simply took the credit (or blame, depending on how you look at it). \",\"Those things,  which ye have both learned, and received,  and heard, and seen in me,  do:  and the God of peace shall be with you.\",\"    >>So good that there isn't any diff whether or not ATManager is turned    >>on or not.

From what I've heard (pure hearsay) the results of outputting    TT fonts as Type 1 is _not_ as good as using high-quality Type 1 fonts in    the first place.

A problem with TT fonts in Windows is that they do get converted to T1 format OK, and the hinting is even used while this is done, but the resulting T1 fonts are NOT hinted.  The result is that they WILL work fine on a device of the resolution assumed by the printer driver when the PS file is generated, but they will not look good when printed at a different resolution.  \",\"I don't know about the dinky little Zephyr's, but the 1100 (now the ZR1100) looks alot like my '76 Z1/ KZ900!  The one I drooled over at Tri-Sports in Topsham, ME was a looker!  Yes, Mercury axed the Zephyr name.  Guess a lot of aging Republicans wanted a Zephyr and confused the Mercury with the Kawasaki :).  Oh well, they're better off with the Kawasaki anyways.  Maybe it'll shake the stick out of their asses and  make Libertarians out of them!  As to the GPz <--> Zephyr, the only GPz I've seen had the ball-buster gas tank profile, not the smooth saddle - to - gas tank transition. _Motorcyclist_ claims the Zephyr / ZR is the modernized Z1 (KZ) from the seventies.

This smacks a bit of ideology -- the supposition being that Toricelli's subsequent descriptions of his reasoning are not veridical.  It gets dangerously close to an unfalsifiable view of the history and methodology of science if we deny that no subsequent reports of experimenters are reliable descriptions of their \\\"real\\\" reasons.   But my point is that this type of case is *not* a rarity.  In fact, I was going to point to Pasteur as yet another rather common example -- particularly the studies on spontaneous generation and fermentation.  I will readily concede that \\\"ridiculous reasons\\\" can play an important role in how scientists spend their time.  But one should not confuse motivation with methodology nor suppose that ridiculous reasons provide the impetus in the majority of cases based on relatively infrequent anecdotal evidence.\",\"Could someone tell me how to make/find/get the best frontplate for IIvi/IIvx/C650 with internal SyQuest drive?

This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory in a powerbook and a ci.   When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I was told by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would return the original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.)  I followed the instructions for returning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks.  Well, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which were ever returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me \\\"Why we never received your old chips.\\\"  I then explained I the procedure that I had followed to return them, to which the person replied \\\"You mean you sent them US Mail?\\\" (which I had, per the original sales person's instructions.)  I was told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that I should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly what I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were absolutely no help.  I sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attempted to trace the package through the US mail, made *many* more phone calls to TechWorks, all to no avail (I wouldn't give-up because I was so disgusted.) Sales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing I could do to pursuade them to \\\"make it right.\\\"  I finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, asking them to investigate the problem.   Three weeks later, the credit miraculously appeared on my statement.  I have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted with the service that I received from a company.  In all fairness, they had no way of knowing that was not trying to rip them off, but I went to *such* great lengths to prove to them that this really happened.  Oh well, c'est la vie.

This is the same anti-gun police chief that wanted full-auto Uzis for his patrol cars...).  Perhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago's finest, a close-to- 100% reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99% reliable automatic. I note that in Germany, where certainly the 9mm semi-auto handgun is king, some of the more elite police types want revolvers.  I don't think the issue is cost, because Chicago police certainly make on the order of at least $40K/year.   Your presumption of \\\"disadvantage\\\" I think is not borne out by the experiences of New York City's cops; there the cops usually come out on top with their standard .38 Spl revolvers.

As many knowledgeable people have pointed out, msg is a naturally  occurring substance in a lot, if not most, foods.  When food  manufacturers add it to a preparation, they do so because it's a  known flavor enhancer.   Your wife's theory, that MSG is added to food to stimulate appetite,  may well be true.  But I don't believe it's ALWAYS the reason it's  added.  People are (largely, for the most part) in charge of their  own appetites.   You don't know much about cats, do you?   Cats will Take Advantage of You.  Resign yourself:  you will never   understand a cat.  Their tastes are whimsical.    I also suspect, though it's been a while since I've checked ingredients  on commercial cat food, that there are much more stringent requirements  on pet food additives than human.    See, the FDA has this stupid idea that human beings have the intelligence  to look out after their own interests.  \",\"I bought a car with a defunct engine, to use for parts for my old but still running version of the same car.

The original posting complained (1) about SGI coming out with newer (and better) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones, and (2) that DEC did.  On statement (1), I merely attempted to point out that all computer companies are constantly attempting to improve their product (& market position/share).  In so doing, they eventually come to a point where they have a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace the system.  And the particular system he was complaining about was (in computer lifetimes) relatively old.  On statement (2), I felt DEC's history of providing upgrades was not far superior than the industry \\\"average\\\", and that, in my opinion, SGI's history is better than DEC's.  (And what is DEC doing with it's MIPS based DECstation line?  Are they going to \\\"abandon\\\" it for their Alpha based line, or provide an upgrade path to R4400's and TFP's and R5's?)\",\"High power assault gun?

I don't think it's heat, per se (I've had more in winter than summer). Dehydration could conceivably figure, though.  Try tanking up before playing rather than after.  Being in shape doesn't seem to help me much, either.  I've identified four factors that do make a difference (listed in  descending order of importance):  1) Heavy exercise 2) Sleep deprivation 3) Fasting  (e.g., skipped breakfast) 4) Physical trauma (e.g., head bonk)  Heavy exercise has preceded all of my post-adolescent migraines, but I  don't get migraines after every heavy exercise session.  One or more of  the other factors *must* be present (usually #2).  Since I discovered  this, I've been nearly migraine-free -- relapsing only once every two  or three years when I get cocky (\\\"It's been so long, maybe I just don't  get them anymore\\\") and stop being careful.  Hope this is helpful.\",\"Yo, Whaz up!!!  Earlier, I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs.  One guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well, I saw one think that someone said about \\\"Show me a team that used Split- fires....\\\"  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.  Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and increased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires increased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing on horsepower numbers.  Now how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that depends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine? In the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque, but 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low. So for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.  But what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins, but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for the hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However, twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this translate?  Increased torque should \\\"theoretically\\\" help twins make more power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods or anything made, just stick 'em in.  Now I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with somebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than 4's.          As far as racing teams....  Ducati team \\\"Fast by Ferraci\\\" used splitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James running for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then. Also, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....  Peace.

Basically, vasomotor rhinitis means your nose is stuffy when it has no reason to be (not even an identifiable allergy).  Decongestants and steroid sprays work for vasomotor rhinitis.  Also, I can get surprising relief from purely superficial measures such as saline moisturizing spray and moisturizing gel. \",\"      What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?  Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution, crudely speaking, indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution.     Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are    quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?     Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?     Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population (within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic halo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed) (also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was probably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)  As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism of getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start to see for example the Andromeda's bursters.  The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution (but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence isotropy) and the edge is \\\"the edge of the Universe\\\" ;-) If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect) and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.   If we know anything about physics at that level, the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings, wrong spectrum for one thing.  The situation is further complicated by recent claims that there are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS they'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]     my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering    hyperspace :-)     but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they    are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered    if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.

In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder.  It is  disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed  solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth. It seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant, and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation. I will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of what the situation really is in South Lebanon.    I am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information we are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the  people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily business, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to imagine ????  It is NOT a \\\"terrorist camp\\\" as you and the Israelis like  to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc..... SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not  know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they are back they announce that they bombed a \\\"terrorist  hideout\\\" where an 8 year old girl just happened to be. We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is  the Israeli way of telling us that \\\"if you're gonna hurt our soldiers you're gonna pay the price\\\".  We accept this as a price we have to pay to free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting the resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young  men to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers. Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING  ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real  leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw. The people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a  regular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that the so called \\\"Security Zone\\\" is necessary for the protection of  Northern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace, than it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the  establishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the best policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the establishment of peace keeping troops along the border.  I have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled. This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to realize that the concept of a \\\"buffer zone\\\" aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel would have resulted in.   If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw  unilaterally from the so-called \\\"Security Zone\\\" before the conclusion of the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives, advance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's  public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations  since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in  peace and has already offered some important concessions. Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not  accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it. There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such  circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of Lebanon.     I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.   I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make  Yes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians. The real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave Israeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an  occupying soldier is attacked.   \",\" >a real RNG ?

I respond.       The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise      before entering into heaven. No one has made a point for or against       that issue, nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox      belief. The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom (Luke 16),       the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).       The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent      on their death bed. Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was      contradictory to what John's position put forward. The thief on the       cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise, the abode of       the righteous dead. John's position possibly needs to be reworked.      Kermit needs to address the topic at hand.\",\"Hi again,  Many thanks to all the people who responded to my request for a MS- Windows screen grabber.  It proves to me AGAIN that the net is a  wonderful thing.  :-)  So, in summary:  There are two choices:  1) Various screen grabber packages (Corel Draw has one, there are a couple on simtel and cica).  2) Use the built-in PrintScreen and Alt-PrintScreen functionality to paste the screen (or window) to the clipboard.  Then paste the  clipboard to your application.  Cool!  Again, thanks for the info...  Grant (the MS-Windows newbie -- Unix and X are my bag ;-) \",\" Very well put.  And, in the case of someone who calls himself a Christian brother yet continues in his sin (and claims that his sin is not a sin at  all, but perfectly acceptable), what should be done?  Should Christians  just ignore a sinful lifestyle in order to not offend the person?  By  reaffirming that the lifestyle is sinful according to the Bible, are  they using \\\"a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus\\\"?   Frankly, I find the occurance of a homosexual Christian attempting to  pass himself off as a 'straight' Christian in order to have other  Christians accept his chastisement better a *lot* more serious than  people reaffirming that the Bible teaches homosexuality is a sin.  \",\"Finally, an objective source.  Alomar's a great player, but so is Baerga. Nice to see the objective source cited rather than \\\"my dad's bigger than your dad\\\" posts.\",\"       ^^^^  Just what are these \\\"scientific facts\\\"?  I have never heard of such a thing.

I'll let the rest of the net judge this on its own merits. Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished  of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only  the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian  Armenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of  Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines  genocide as acting with a     'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a     national, ethnic, racial or religious group.'   History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate  the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the  Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including  U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy  as a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of  the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the  extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor  those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians.   The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established, beyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people during the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian  territories.  The Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed. The massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian  Government.  The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were Dro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri, Karakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.

I believed this and to put it nicely, it was a piece of junk!  I loved this car, I babied it, I pampered it, and after 2 years, it just couldn't stay together, I would say that not everyone will have the problems that I had, but know this, it's not just the car, it is the ability to get the car fixed, which will NOT happen at any chrysler/dodge/take your pick dealer.  I don't care if there are going to reform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believe it when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.  You drive up, just looking, you don't even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10) salesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you, and try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards. Service is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem, but they tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of work/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care of this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took it to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn't have been.  1988 Dodge Shadow ES  These were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.  Engine  4 Alternators Rear Suspension Torsion Bar 2 Water pumps 5 thermostats Hall effect sensor Main computer 4 Batteries  These were rebuilt/repaired  Radiator Automatic Transmission Power Steering   Those are just the things I can remember off the top of my head.  For about a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it's a good car, I just can't find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I traded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I just stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000 worth of repairs over it's lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite me.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are going to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the hell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.  You can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but Japanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I feel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler product again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and I will admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM isn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they do their divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.    Don't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a hawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car is really good, until it has proved itself to me.  But since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because I used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good thing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were they moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend always thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.  And although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, I will use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink with the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the shadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the chrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is just average.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  You can find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched the Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal of information about this company, just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for good reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I think this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in Toyota said and I quote, \\\"We are watching them very closely.\\\"  Come on, everybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been kicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to set in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They are still struggling because they haven't learned yet.  They have the ability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date, but their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.

Did I misunderstand?\",\"Hi,  I've just returned from a visit with my OB/GYN and I have a few  concerns that maybe y'all can help me with.  I've been seeing  her every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28)  and during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every  4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period.  As it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that  though I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she  mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13  weeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had  an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no  problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain  in my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very  difficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or  move unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for  when I do need to go out.)   Anyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from  the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about  2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.   (I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating  very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well  now I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile  related.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my  upper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I  was lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because  it started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt   no matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I  ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had  turned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if  I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it  wasn't as much of a problem.  So the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid  fatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware  of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have  been avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat  foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.    But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat  except fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts,  fried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I  should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only  have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day (  potatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in  a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or  steamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have  some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if  I'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it  from my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if  she's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her  recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on  cholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She  originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the  entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I  started.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and  she's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also  asked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them  are.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain,  and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did  want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be  temporary for that one week.   What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I  would understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying  that anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she  assumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that  because of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to  use the energy from the food I do eat.   Any opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm  truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet  because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few  minutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I  don't find any foods satisfying.  Thanks \",\"I have used both my serial ports with a modem and a serial printer,  so I cannot use Appletalk.

Which version of the Bible is the perfectly preserved one?  And why are there so many translations that are not perfectly preserved?  Is God trying to confuse us?   But that is exactly what happend.  There are so many branches of  denominations of Christianity and deviations of doctrine portruding from varying translations of biblical texts by \\\"serious students\\\" that are much too numerous to begin to count.  If there is a Perfect Bible, then there would be no possible misinterpretation and there would be no need for anyone here to be debating it.  On the other hand, maybe the Bible is perfect, but no one on this planet is perfect enough to read it correctly, but then there would be no point in God giving us something we cannot use correctly.   IMHO, if you trust your salvation on the reliability of a single book, you are on weak ground.  Remember, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  This Word existed BEFORE the Bible was written.  (Note: Word <==> God).  This Word that John is trying to describe cannot be fully described in any written language, all languages being IMPERFECT.  Realization comes only from contemplation of the Word, and is outside the boundaries of language.  I use the Bible as a guide, a stepping stone, but in no way is it my final authority.

As it turned out, the taxes killed the Reagan expansion and the caps on spending increases were dispelled by Clinton in his first act as President (so that he could create his own new plan with more tax increases).  The result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level  ABOVE where it was when Reagan left office.\",\"Since this posting, I've received no replies or followups, so I'm posting here hoping for the feedback I didn't get in rec.audio.car:  article number - 9855 Newsgroups: rec.audio.car Path: cbfsb!cbnewsb.cb.att.com!vinlai From: vinlai@cbnewsb.cb.att.com (vincent.lai) Subject: Third party car antennas ...

Former Secretary of Education William Bennet, a Roman Catholic, stood beside the Christian Coalition's spokesman Ralph Reed at a March 3 conference in Washington.  The purpose of the conference was to publish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed to prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it backed away from the \\\"Family Values\\\" positons of the '92 convention.  Conservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson's organization with political expertise, legal assistance and high tech communications support.  The Catholic Campaign for  American, designed as a Catholic version of the Moral Majority, was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes. Ms. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom Council in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988.  Ms. Elwell was hired by Domino's Pizza magnate, Tom Monaghan, in 1989 to manage Legatus, a \\\"nonpolitical\\\", Catholic businessmen's group. Membership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least $4 million in annual revenues.  Relying on a network of wealthy contacts at Legatus, Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the Catholic Campaign.  The Campaign's list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep. Robert K. Dornan, Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, the lovely Pat Buchanan and Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus.   Also on the national committee is Keith Fournier, a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice.  Another Catholic, Thomas Patrick Monaghan, senior counsel of Robertson's ACLJ, is also an active supporter of the Catholic Campaign.  The board of directors includes Frank Shakespeare, broadcasting exec and former U.S. ambassador to the Pope, Wall Street executive Frank Lynch, former Reagan official Richard V. Allen, Bishop Rene Gracida of Corpus Christi and Mary Ellen Bork, wife of unsuccessful Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork.

I got the vague impression from their mission proposal that they weren't taking a very holistic aproach to the whole thing.  They seemed to want to land people on the Moon by the end of the decade without  explaining why, or what they would do once they got there.

My observations over the past 30 years (and not withstanding a little history reading beside) is that while religious differences do play a part in many of the conflicts, so does (unfortunately) race, economics and any other items that identify one group of men as being different from another.  If we want to couch the cause of conflict in Christian terms, I would put it while Christ died for our sins, we are yet sinners. While some individuals assume \\\"Christlike\\\" natures, most of us do not even come close.

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.  Logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise OED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument.  Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely explains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job.  Propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \\\"It is raining\\\" or \\\"Today is Tuesday\\\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to be true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning of \\\"deny\\\", not the everyday meaning.  The proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular arrangement of words used to express it.  So \\\"God exists\\\" and \\\"There exists a God\\\" both express the same proposition.  An argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \\\"a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition\\\".  An argument consists of three stages.  First of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions.   Premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \\\"because\\\", \\\"since\\\", \\\"obviously\\\" and so on.  (The phrase \\\"obviously\\\" is often viewed with suspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to question it.  You can always say \\\"Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious\\\" when you've heard the explanation.)  Next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of valid inference.  The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \\\"implies that\\\" or \\\"therefore\\\".  Finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as \\\"therefore\\\", \\\"it follows that\\\", \\\"we conclude\\\" and so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.  For example:  Every event has a cause (premise) The universe has a beginning (premise) All beginnings involve an event (premise) This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference) Therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)  Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.  Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example, the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated  afterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if  sometimes a little confusing.  Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some statements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:  \\\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,  or the Son of God.\\\"  This is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its  conclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll come to those later.)  Another example:  \\\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\\\"  The phrase \\\"do your duty to God\\\" is not a proposition, since it is neither true nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an argument.  Finally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \\\"A because B\\\".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the statement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then it is not an argument, it is an explanation.  For example:  \\\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not  start.\\\" -- This is an argument.  \\\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\\\"  -- This is an explanation.  There are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions -- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the conclusion is true.  An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid; however, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments, and about how probable their premises are.  There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.  It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly  counter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more carefully.  Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions.  For example:     All insects have wings (premise)    Woodlice are insects (premise)    Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)  Here, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false.  If the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true.  The argument is thus entirely valid.  More subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises, as in:     All fish live in the sea (premise)    Dolphins are fish (premise)    Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)  However, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \\\"truth table\\\" for implication.  The symbol \\\"=>\\\" denotes implication; \\\"A\\\" is the premise, \\\"B\\\" the conclusion.  \\\"T\\\" and \\\"F\\\" represent true and false respectively.  Premise Conclusion Inference    A        B        A=>B ----------------------------    F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference    F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.     T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion                              false, the inference must be invalid.     T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,                              the conclusion must be true.  A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound  argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments.  To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.  In everyday English the term \\\"fallacy\\\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair enough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or convincing.  So for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive.  ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)  The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It is often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \\\"might makes right\\\".  The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.  For example: \\\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM  Argumentum ad hominem is literally \\\"argument directed at the man\\\".  The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.  For example: \\\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\\\"  Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by  showing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not argumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's testimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).  The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent's particular circumstances.  For example: \\\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue otherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?\\\"  This is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent's argument.  This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For  example:  \\\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing.  You're white.\\\"  This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one's adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is also known as \\\"poisoning the well\\\".  ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM  Argumentum ad ignorantium means \\\"argument from ignorance\\\".  This fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true, a basic scientific principle.)  Examples: \\\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\\\"  \\\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has shown any proof that they are real.\\\"  Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty.  Also, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can  validly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:  \\\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water, even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no such flood occurred.\\\"  In science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred, however.  ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM  This is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is  committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a  conclusion accepted.  For example:  \\\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find me guilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan.\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM  This is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language.  For example:  \\\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\\\"  \\\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM  This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more likely it is that that proposition is correct.  ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM  The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion.  For example:  \\\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\\\"  This line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly between:  \\\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\\\" and \\\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent  computer\\\"  Hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable  whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.  THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT  The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose \\\"accidental\\\" circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific.  For example:  \\\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must dislike atheists.\\\"  This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.  CONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION  This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases.  For example: \\\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are insincere.\\\"  SWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER  A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization.  NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  These are known as False Cause fallacies.  The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For  example:  \\\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God cured me of the headache.\\\"  The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For  example:  \\\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons.\\\"  CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that because two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.  PETITIO PRINCIPII  This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached.  CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO  This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:  \\\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job.  Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open to blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office.\\\"  Note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the  conclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees.  Another example is the classic:  \\\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of God.\\\"  COMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION  This is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded  question:  \\\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\\\"  The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination, when they ask questions like:  \\\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\\\"  Similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:  \\\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\\\" or \\\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\\\"  IGNORATIO ELENCHI  The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument  supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion.  For example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.  Sadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light.  EQUIVOCATION  Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument.  For example:  \\\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it remains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\\\"  AMPHIBOLY  Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing.  ACCENT  Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case, the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized.  For example, consider:  \\\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\\\" and \\\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\\\"  FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION  One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole.  For example:  \\\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very  lightweight.\\\"  The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:  \\\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses.\\\"  FALLACY OF DIVISION  The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like its opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:  \\\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\\\"  The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item.  For example:  \\\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\\\"  THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT  This argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful events.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event.  For example: \\\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot legalize marijuana.\\\"  \\\"A IS BASED ON B\\\" FALLACIES / \\\"IS A TYPE OF\\\" FALLACIES  These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.  Examples: \\\"Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of history?\\\"  \\\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a form of Christianity?\\\"  \\\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?\\\"  AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form \\\"A implies B, B is true, therefore A is true\\\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for implication given earlier.  DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form \\\"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\\\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy.  Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has the form \\\"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\\\", where A does NOT in fact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is invalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce anything about B.  CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL  This fallacy is an argument of the form \\\"If A then B, therefore if B then A\\\".  ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM  This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old, or because \\\"that's the way it's always been.\\\"  ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM  This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else.  ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM  The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those with more money are more likely to be right.  ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM  The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam.  ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM  This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard.  An \\\"argumentum ad nauseum\\\" is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something.  BIFURCATION  Also referred to as the \\\"black and white\\\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist.  PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS  This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question.  NON SEQUITUR  A non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it.  RED HERRING  This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the points being made, towards a different conclusion.  REIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION  Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.  SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF  The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.  STRAW MAN  The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it can be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position, then to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made.  THE EXTENDED ANALOGY  The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two  different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a  claim that those situations are analogous to each other.  This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about  anti-cryptography legislation:  \\\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\\\"  \\\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported  Martin Luther King.\\\"  \\\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the  struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\\\"  TU QUOQUE  This is the famous \\\"you too\\\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:  \\\"You're just being randomly abusive.\\\" \\\"So?  You've been abusive too.\\\"\",\"record hand\",\"     Lets just say it is DUI here now!   ----===== DoD #8177 = Technician(Dr. Speed) .NOT.

Client Software: SunOs 4.1.1, X11R5 Server Hardware: Sun IPC Server Software: SunOs 4.1.1, Open Windows 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37)  A Motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the OpenWindows 3.0 server (xnews). The pulldown is displayed but then no button actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> will unstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown is grabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the display continue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. If I log in from another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets back to normal. The same application when run against other X servers (including MIT X11R5 Xsun, DecWindows, Tektronix X terminal) has no problems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a work-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users.  I have tried the following things:      1. Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch        (100444-37).      2. Using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm.      3. Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110).

Assuming you're serious, I guess you'd be surprised to hear that us GUYS don't think so. I would guess that a tiny fraction of 1% of the folks reading your post agree with it. I kind of doubt that even you agree with it.  I'm not going to go through your points one at a time, because,  after all, not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball.  I'm only replying to this because you brought up Pam Postema, the AAA umpire who sued (is suing?) baseball on the grounds of sex discrimination because she wasn't promoted to the majors.   I've never seen her ump a game. I have no first hand experience with her ability as an umpire.  But I have seen her on talk shows. And her point seems to be that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. It seems to me that she is missing the point and if that's how she sees the role of umpires in the game, well I wouldn't promote her either.  The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners safe or out; hell, Joe Lundy could do that. Their primary function is to maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the players from trying to kill each other.   Umpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies most of us, both men and women. And if Ms. Postema thinks that she deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of the rulebook, then I think that disqualifies her as well. Umpires need to command the game; command of the rulebook is secondary.   \",\" : Mr Connor's assertion that \\\"more complex\\\" == later in paleontology : is simply incorrect.

Regards Jack Waters II DoD#1919\",\"    Here's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time dithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational  equipment to \\\"back out\\\" the errors in its position (since it knows where it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a  broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit.  The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will use existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately 305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals on different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers correction signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system which has stations all across the US.  The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format. Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------- John P. Baker                   | My opinions are my own.

For instance, 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering' might be thought of as a plausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the contention remains true, just as '5 + 7 = 12' remains correct even if there is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor can they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding content;  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true in virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to action (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may talk of 'self-evident truths', but can he deny the subjectivist's claim that self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself.  To hold a moral opinion is, he suggests, not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human activity.\\\"\",\"   Bill, I find it rather remarkable that you managed to zero in on what is probably the weakest evidence.

With those reports about : Bosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that : the massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered : me was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I : shouldn't be so troubled about the reports of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" in : Bosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims. : Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians : who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing : God's work?  Perhaps it would be useful to ask whether those doing the ethnic cleansing could be said to be loving those they are killing in the very act of killing.  Does it reflect the attitude of God, who sends rain to both the just and the unjust?  If not, then Christians should be uncomfortable with it.  Jesus gave his followers the law of love to follow and it is by exhibiting this that disciples will be known.  Doctrinal (or political) correctness is not the standard, so I don't see why Christians should be moved against the Serbs because their ancestors converted from Christianity to Islam.  It seems to me that as a Christian you _should_ be troubled by the ethnic cleansing. -- \",\"    I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.    This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride    (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty,     fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).  I'd say this is a very bad idea - you should start out with something much mellower so that neither one of you get in over your head. That particular road requires full concentration - not the sort of thing you want to take a passenger on for the first time.  Once you both decide that you like riding together, and want to do something longer and more challenging, *then* go for a hard core road like Mines-Mt. Hamilton.  In any case, it's *your* (moral) responsibility to make sure that she has proper gear that fits - especially if you're going sport riding.\",\" You can change it.

What's the point here?  You're arguing that the black market WORKS (which it does, of course).     This is the wrong way to quantify things.  The smuggler would be concerned about value/cubic foot.

Tony\",\": Exodus 21:22-25:  :        22 And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with :           child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further :           injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman's husband may :           demand of him; and he shall pay as the judges decide. :        23 But if there is any further injury, then you shall appoint :           as a penalty life for life, :        24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, :        25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.  : The most straightforward interpretation of these verses is that if : men in a fight strike a woman and cause her to miscarry, the penalty : is only a fine.  If, however, the woman is injured or dies, the : *lex talionis* doctrine of \\\"an eye for an eye\\\" applies.  This is the : Jewish interpretation, and is supported by Jewish commentaries on : these verses. :    This is quite an embarrassment for pro-lifer Christians, so there is : of course an alternate explanation.  The alternative interprets the : word \\\"miscarriage\\\" to mean \\\"premature birth\\\"--i.e., the child is born : alive--and \\\"further injury\\\" to mean injury to either the woman or : the fetus.  This is not a straightforward interpretation, it is not : (so far as I know) supported by any Jewish commentaries, and it does : not appeared to be supported by any other part of the Bible.  What if any, historical reference do we have to abortion at this time?  Did the ancient Jew have appropriate reference to understand abortion? (I am truly asking, not making a point veiled as a question).  If there is  little understanding of the medical procedure we know as abortion, it is not surprising the Bible makes little reference to it, as it makes little reference to nuclear power and contamination.\",\"  i'm sorry, as i have never heard of any of this.  Guess they don't think it's important enough for a classroom, and i was going on what i've seen in pics.(some movies--real nice scource there, huh?)  I just always  recall thinking that GOOD roads of asphalt didn't come around til the Interstate Hiway Act, or whatever they called it(60's?), and that wood and cobblestone roads were fairly rare up through the depression, except in overpopulated places like England and US cities.

Its hard to predicatbaly drift a stock Mustang because of the suspension.   Yes. When i think Mustang, I think school-bus +  F16 motor. In my mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90 or so. It just isn't safe, check out your local junkyard, Mustangs outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in junkyards.  I find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the Mustang for poor brakes in relation to power. Ford should at least standardize on the SVO rear brakes for all 5.0's.     True of Northern Europe, latin countries are something else.  Kindof true. remember they were build by adolf in the '30's.   Yes.   \\\"Autobahn\\\" is the german word for freeway. Other countries have different names for loose equivalents; autostrada, autoroute, motorway etc.   Europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasn't passed as far as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than the US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred to the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things you really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more professional attitude to driving. You just never see two cars running parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.   You're wrong. GTI's  go this fast. Just kind of noisy, not the ideal  autobahn car. A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers foot on the floor. How do I know? - when you're not making any ground on the identical car in front of you!   If something happens at 130-150 you're dead, but the same goes for much over 35. Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. I feel much safer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical US traffic because most people seem to be awake. I've never seen any driver reading a book on an autobahn, I see it all too often in the US.  Craig  It just doesn't *seem* fast after 30 minutes or so of aclimation. everybody drives that fast, no big deal. \",\" Ummm.. I think you left the message out...

Tzeng\",\"for SRC  In most languages, the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is known as the PASCH, or PASQUE, or some variation thereof, a word which comes from the Hebrew PESACH, meaning \\\"Passover.\\\" In English, German, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER, or some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the origin of this term.  One explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE RATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great scholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived 673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of the word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well established before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely that his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that there had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name, and the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance (surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should have a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf convincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does not make it more so.  Assuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the Christian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some centuries before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots. It would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians and beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every spring, called it by the name that to them meant simply \\\"Spring Festival.\\\"  However, Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J Knoblech, in \\\"Die Sprach,\\\" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5 (Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:  Among Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast of the Resurrection was known as \\\"hebdomada alba\\\" (white week), since the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their white baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was referred to simply as \\\"albae.\\\" Translaters rendering this into German mistook it for the plural of \\\"alba,\\\" meaning \\\"dawn.\\\" They accordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for \\\"dawn.\\\" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.

EDT              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon  to be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out  the first pitch.              Q   It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not  Amtrack.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's  going from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.              Q   George, what exactly are you prepared to do to  break the logjam with  ??? Senate?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are  discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning,  and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point  that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs  to be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for  summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the  important programs that will put people back to work right away this  summer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be  passed.              Q   Will he compromise, that's the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions  are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and  Senator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President  believes his jobs program should go forward.              Q   George, would the President be willing to accept $8  billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise  being offered by --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being  offered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right  now, let's see what happens today.              Q   Would he go that far -- no matter what the  Republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per  year?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his  program should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be  willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to  come up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's  see what happens.              Q   It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has  happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order  to get a vote?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more  intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in  doing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the  Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the  President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action,  real jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no  question about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative  activity over the last few days.              Q   So, you'll need to compromise to get your package  through?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the  conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.              Q      prepared to compromise --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen  to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting  with Senator Dole.               Q   Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's  been very successful so far in the beginning of his term.              Q   How?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record  time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by  $500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for  important investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong  passage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a  minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock  and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that  he is not succeeding overall.              Q   He can't beat this, can he?              Q   The fact is they can do that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop  action.  There's no question about that.              Q   What are you going to do about it?              Q   George, what do you know about these alleged notes  taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears  that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that  when they say yes they mean no?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete  misreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the  conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring  President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime  Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's  belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.   I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and  etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where  he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese  were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.              Q    Are you saying that the President said that when  the Japanese say yes they mean no?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the  exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say  something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime  Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.              Q   Have there been any attempts to explain this to the  Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and  there appears to be --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the  Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It  does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of  view.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that  there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up  but I'm not positive.              Q   George, was the specific comment that was made  specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general  observation on Japanese etiquette?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --              Q   The specific comment is what I'm asking about that  has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, \\\"when the  Japanese say yes they mean no.\\\"              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean  I don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific  comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific  finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that  Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.              Q   Was he saying it facetiously first?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual  observation.              Q   And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to  clear it up.  Has the President sent a message?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President  spoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but  I'm not sure exactly how many.              Q   Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're  making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got  the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that  it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the  Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure  there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is  on.              Q   What is our position about the Japanese?  That they  may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese  is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two  days.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime  Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S.  position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the  Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's  commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a  constructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to  hear that.              Q   After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq  for the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S.  policy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary  Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have  reiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance  with all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.              Q      throwing it out further that if Iraq complies,  Saddam can't stay in office?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our  judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with  the resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that  we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will  continue to demand it.              Q   And are you concerned the Iran will become the  dominant power in the area --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also  spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect  full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping  support of terrorism.              Q   That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in  power if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you  base that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not  complying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the  rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is  not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.   He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding  armaments.              Q   Well, when do you think that if he did comply he  would be out of power?        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on  the repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make  it more difficult for him to stay in power.              Q   George, back on the stimulus package, why is it  that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure  politics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence  do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical  difference with you that's in good faith?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times  in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the  fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now  seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.                Q   George, in regards to that, some of the moderate  Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to  them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had  one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate  Republicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and  thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some - -              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true  that there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the  Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the  introduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate  Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are  continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who  have an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in  what they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is  important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.              Q      your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats  alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it  through?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is  no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can  frustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.   You only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going  and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.              Q      going to rethink the way you attempt to get  other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of  the summer?              Q      work with Republicans and try to woo some  Republicans into your camp?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to  look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the  President's intiatives?              Q   But on this one -- how are you going to do it  differently than you did it on this one because on this one you  really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear  that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and  could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?   Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for  particular votes?  When you have to go through --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and  understand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the  President's going to continue to reach out when he can.              Q   You don't have any regrets then about the way you  have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your  approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this  experience?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like  his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue  to press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans,  there's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with  them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this  case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around  a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.              Q   They're being denied any other legislative means of  putting their proposals forward.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --              Q      any ideas.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being  defeated; I don't know that they're being denied.              Q      to present them.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean  they get the votes --              Q      that theirs can be passed though by the  parliamentary rules under which they're playing.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in  support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.              Q   George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration  backing any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?              Q      backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for  Iraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of  grooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at  some levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about  anything recently.              Q      Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the  President's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be  some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the  President, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider  something like that, or any other kind of intervention there?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President  appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a  special envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around  the California economic situation, including the situation in Los  Angeles.                I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles  by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary,  Mr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD  Secretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits  by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I  wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to  California.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is  concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy  decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities  which help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to  watch it.              Q   George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also  supposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a  group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball  management.  Does the President have a position on that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received  correspondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson  has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.   He clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in  baseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the  President intends to continue to go to the ball game.              Q   Is he going to say anything about it today, or see  Reverend Jackson while he's out there?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see  them, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has  raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said,  even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.              Q   Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball  game?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe  the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an  informational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to  the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining  his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the  President read it.              Q   George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the  managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be  there, and is he going to meet with the President?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.              Q   What is the Mubarak schedule?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is  coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a  lunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice  President Gore.              Q   And joint statements tomorrow --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end,  yes.              Q   Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did  warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist  activities?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times,  I mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been  general conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a  long period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I  mean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there  was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.   The President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also  reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.              Q   George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians,  apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who,  forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at  the moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in  their attempts to get some kind of action.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would  agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did  say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a  network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate  action.  But there was no specific information on this specific  operation at all.              Q   So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the  law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have  received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in  not pursuing some kind of --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.              Q   What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing  mention in the news conference yesterday --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your  question.              Q   Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted  action between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what  does the U.S. do next?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going  to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our  allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways  to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an  agreement.              Q   George, why do you think sanctions is still an  option?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the  leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait  you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day  said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any  time soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When  does no mean no and you have to do something different?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something  different.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the  U.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to  try and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every  opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.              Q   Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something  that is under consideration.              Q   George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's  condition, how he's doing?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.              Q   George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think  we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning  after the Mubarak visit.              Q   Is he going somewhere for Easter?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.              Q   What more can you tell us about the additional aid  to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with  the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.   I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their  delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the  Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the  next several weeks.              Q   Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude  of the one announced Sunday?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the  magnitude.              Q   How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where  do you stand on that --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday,  he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week  and reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this  week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a  hard look at it.              Q   But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White  House involvement, Congress is compiling this list?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the  congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll  be able to get our own researchers working as well.              Q   George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a  probability than a possibility?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under  discussion.              Q   Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter  of time and -- for months before that happens.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's  something that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working  with our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll  continue to review other matters.              Q   George, can you tell us anything about the schedule  this week?  Any travel?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I  don't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right  now.              Q   Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish  American organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference  of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe,        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National  Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.   We'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate  discussions.              Thanks. \",\"Hello, I am looking for commercial software packages for professional fashion designers.

Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian without neglecting the need for scientific rigor.   (Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing will be discussed at the beginning - Note: I've set all followups to sci.med since most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I'm sure most of the replies, if any, will be med-related.)     They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS). Oops, that is not a recognized \\\"illness\\\" in the psychological community, better not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)  Actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system, just e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general population, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among physicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage - any help here a.p.p.er's?)  One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious choleric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to control, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are also extroverted, they are best described as \\\"Field Marshalls\\\".  This trait is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to lead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge, to raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically- minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However, when the NT person has self-image challenges, the \\\"dark-side\\\" of this personality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.  A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling), and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've known many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them with a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).  Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)  Enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.    You've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being the phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent.    In my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune stressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged. I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the details), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this diagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal therapy below).   The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being considered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween infection.    I was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after my blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then dropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received zinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular specialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal, he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin) supplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene. Call me carrot face.  :^)  Hopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to all supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for example, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had good information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.    Though I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my sinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that demonstrate candida \\\"blooms\\\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation (sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on Sporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered normal).  BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious) aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion.    My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic response to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive. Another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow part-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a  threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post, one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a  Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.  BTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \\\"Sinus Survival\\\", has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic anti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over 90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it doesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection is not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that nystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.  This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit, lots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who has to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.    This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the appropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture the yeast \\\"bloom\\\" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.  It's a real Catch-22.  Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that no studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not up to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which should not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should be done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets, you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get funding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the smaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other doctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get nowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.  It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have *decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable hypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue -  excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will not, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...    Aren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia?    Again, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus species can grow hyphae (\\\"roots\\\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing in bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but you can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has been pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in e-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long- term treatment of GI tract \\\"candidiasis\\\".  It's like trying to weed a garden by cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away.  The $60000 question is whether a contained candida \\\"bloom\\\" can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \\\"systemic\\\" in the classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal.    Also, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a prior post, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)    As I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work. For example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention surgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and fairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and equalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly improved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated. Of course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have improved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to \\\"live with it\\\".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total \\\"cure\\\".  The anti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those having sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above. Be sure to get the revised edition.)    Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his visits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said \\\"you'll just have to live with it\\\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and non-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road to recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti- \\\"yeast hypothesis\\\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as, \\\"it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\\\", to put it mildly. I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient.  Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \\\"hypothetical yeast overgrowth\\\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people have identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues have been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things - you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice? Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with \\\"scientific correctness\\\" that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which we don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach (such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having exhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I went to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment, and as a result I have found significant relief.  Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having his license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt) therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me: \\\"well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority to use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I can't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State Board.\\\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic reasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the patient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine, and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything it can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of which seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all (true quackery).

I don't remember his name or title off hand and I have discarded the colloquia announcement. In any case, he was  asked about that very matter: \\\"Why can't we spend a few million more to keep instruments that we already have in place going?\\\"  His responce was that there are only so many $ available to him and the lead time on an instrument like a COBE, Magellan, Hubble, etc is 5-10 years minumum.  If he spent all that could be spent on using current instruments in the current budget enviroment he would have very little to nothing for future projects.  If he did that, sure in the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular, however starting a few years after he had retired he would become one of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for not funding the early stages of the next generation of instruments.  Just as he had benefited from his predicessor's funding choices, he owed it to whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing new missions, even at the expense of cutting off some instruments before the last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them.  \",\"  Fred.

For a review, refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 and June 1919.  Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War, and was unclassified after the war. Supposedly, the government rethought this soon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.  The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of their signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore, the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.

The gist of that topic seems to be:  \\\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\\\".   (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).  --------------- Window Managers ---------------    There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different   features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a   balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this   point, most respondents have agreed upon \\\"twm\\\" as the best candidate   for a speedy window manager.     A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,   is turning off unnecessary things like \\\"zooming\\\" and \\\"opaque move\\\".   Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the   amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping   windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)    I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:   -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is   the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)   and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the   display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.  ------------ The X Server ------------  Which Server? - - - - - - -   Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.   If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.    On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between   the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to   me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute   to less paging.            [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),                         Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]    How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law   (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be   compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.   You can expect to get \\\"*very* large speedups in the server\\\" by not   using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results   would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial   compilers on the market.  Locking the Server into RAM? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and   does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help   performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few   pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone   who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.        [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),           Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),           Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ] Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - -   Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :     If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep     for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my     .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...     we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.    This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!      Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of   why this works, which I have summarized here:      When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to     start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by     the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of     pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the     server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you     put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself     sorted out before the clients start up.      Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X     client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources     being fetched, programs initializing state and \\\"databases\\\" and so     forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this     initialization is done (\\\"The process has reached a steady state\\\"),     the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.     By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your     .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your     workstation's limited resources    This is most definitely a \\\"Your Mileage May Vary\\\" situation, as there   are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap   space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients   you are starting, etc.    Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &    I've experimented with:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 3; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 4; exec xterm ) &    I've even tried:  (sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &   and then in start_X_clients_script I had:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &      [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had     completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down     into a \\\"steady state\\\" before the sleep expired and all my clients     were launched. ]    All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with   my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to   experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.  Fonts - - -   Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts   your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.    One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one   large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or   at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.   Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded   into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer   fonts will be loaded by the server.          [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),            Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]    eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13   in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since   I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.    Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):     Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.     If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.  About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - -      Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves     on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)    One suggestion:      In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum     number of resources that you want to have available to all of your     applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true      Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific     resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your     .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:   setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N      [ The \\\"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\\\" FAQ contains     an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.     --ed.]      So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from     .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,     and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same     XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system     app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to     find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files     with the same name.      This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).       [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),            Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),                and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).       Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]    This method of organizing your personal resources has the following   benefits:      - Easier to maintain / more usable.      - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER       property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally       quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.      - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort        through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.    It also has drawbacks:      - the application that you are interested in has to load an       additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to       make that much of a performance difference, and you might       consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an       application's resource database, you just need to re-run the       application without having to \\\"xrdb\\\" again.      - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When       your resources are split out into multiple resource files and       then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.       WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!        I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped       out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource       files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why       my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*       provide any error message when it encountered the C style       comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted       processing the resource file.        The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef       COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this       method of resource management.      - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For       example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their       resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.      - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files       with the machine where your resources are stored, your client       will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the       server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find       their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)    A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)   is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my   .Xdefaults file, and to use the \\\"separate resources files\\\" method for   clients that I seldom use.  Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In   that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to    \\\"<hostname>:0.0\\\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you   should set your DISPLAY variable to \\\"unix:0.0\\\" or \\\":0.0\\\".  By doing this   you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same   machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.    [thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]    See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further   explanation of how to properly set your display name.    \\\"I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have   libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when   the DISPLAY isn't set specially.\\\"          Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)    [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change   stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.   I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle   non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT   will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if   you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]  ------- Clients -------    If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think   carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also   about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there   a smaller clock program than xclock?    Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large   they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.    [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients   (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]    I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject   of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are   strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather   large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using   may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In   this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually   _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.    The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try   and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif   clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in   more than one toolkit library.    Know your environment, and think carefully about which client   programs would work best together in that environment.

Extensively configurable.  it can be made to look    very much like MIT oclock, or mostly like xclock purely by changing    resources.

I suspect that   xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.   Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.    If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines   to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),      Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]  1) Xvt    suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :    available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z     \\\"...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get    hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as    xterm is rather a hog! \\\"     This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to    rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current    version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that    there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any    yet.     UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with    Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He    questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For    instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling    speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap    bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm    may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard    numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text    segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.     As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it    made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets    brought into memory.     So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of    xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.    If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.

Its major lack is    scrollback, but some people like it anyway.\\\"   Tuning your client - - - - - - - - - -    Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster.    From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif   Text Field Widgets:      I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I     was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,     particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was     going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource     XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget     (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.     Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the     widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user     can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not     noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference     on a [slower system].    This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots   of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor   embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server   requests?  ------------------------- Miscellaneous Suggestions -------------------------  Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - -   Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.    - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server     is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)    - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm     conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see     people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.      I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by     having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.    - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate     that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.          [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu)     for reminding me of this one. --ed.]  A Quicker Mouse - - - - - - - -   Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen   when you move your mouse.  I use \\\"xset m 3 10\\\" in my .xinitrc file,   which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of   the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.    Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for   fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different   mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.      e.g. (for twm) :       menu \\\"mouse settings\\\" {         \\\"Mouse Settings:\\\"   f.title  \\\"  Very Fast\\\"    ! \\\"xset m 7 10 &\\\"  \\\"  Normal (Fast)\\\"   ! \\\"xset m 3 10 &\\\"  \\\"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)\\\" ! \\\"xset m default &\\\"  \\\"  Glacial\\\"    ! \\\"xset m 0 10 &\\\"       }  Programming Thoughts - - - - - - - - - - -   Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :     To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of     things you can do.  Some that stick out:      - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual       buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or       labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager       widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.      - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.      - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.       (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)      - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE       difference.      - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the       difference between a fast application and a completely unusable       one.    Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :     Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc     function would greatly increase performance of Xt based     applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying     out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some     tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the     differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)    [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]    Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :    - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.      Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but     they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the     blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most     cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to     run through it's event-loop again and again.    - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.      This \\\"Gfx Context Switching\\\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,     where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed     again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching     and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will     remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the     connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).  Say What!? - - - - - -    Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:    David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :     How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs     on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your     machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the     same operation between client and server.    I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received   the following confirmation...    Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):     I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big     difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage     and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This     helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was     essential when I only had 8 MB.    Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :     [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as     your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a     major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in     absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.    Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :     Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's     cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate     doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they     are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your     action.      The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2     cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going     over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved     buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing     even fewer context switches.  ---------------------------- Other Sources of Information ----------------------------    Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System   Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.

On the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x,y positions are known.    Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron Danon's excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which converts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click the mouse.  Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values.  This is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process, scanner errors and what have you.  The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so \\\"global\\\" adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or rotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.

As published in \\\"US Industrial Outlook 1993\\\"  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be \\\"adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.\\\"                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  \\\"Space Business Indicators\\\" in mid-year, and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year  through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a  planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation, and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request \\\"launch on demand\\\"  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should  provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/\\\"Spacelifter\\\" program.  At this  time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all \\\"ELV upgrade\\\" programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \\\"Spacelifter\\\"  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget  deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \\\"GO-AHEAD\\\"    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture  by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a \\\"Star Wars\\\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists,  agricultural planners, and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last  November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,  government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \\\"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\\\"     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analyst's report Morgan Stanley said \\\"We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.\\\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate  management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,  many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track, this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early  February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane  holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the  decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.     [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and  I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service, but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,  Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their  investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at  lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an  investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column, some of the initial  investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \\\"Aerokosmos\\\"  winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \\\"Severkosmos\\\",  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.     [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new  venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This one's a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.     [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the  Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:   - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore  Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts, former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.     What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B  satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \\\"the main  alternative rocket supplier\\\" for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of \\\"off the shelf\\\" components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,  launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),  headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist  Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the  satellite's communications channels.      [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the  release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \\\"Asiasat- 2\\\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based \\\"Asiasat\\\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and  other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's  aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry, specifically including space  activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \\\"made in Korea.\\\"   Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of  consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+%  of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

This column's already full?  And I still have bunches of  commercial space developments to report on.  As I said at the start  of this, column there's been a lot of interesting happenings - but  I'll have to put them into the next issue.      Looking ahead, I've got several articles in the works on new  happenings with Iridium and the LEO communications satellite market,  more news on international launchers appearing (and disappearing) on  the market, new international commercial space ventures,  and other  interesting developments.     And as always, I hope you folks find this stuff useful and  interesting -- Any and all comments are welcome.  \",\"  Oops, sorry, my words, not the words of the Qur'an.   Note that \\\"(the celestial bodies)\\\" in the above verse is an interpolation (which is why it is in brackets) -- it is the translator's  (incorrect, IMHO) interpretation.  Here is Maurice Bucaille's translation (he studied Arabic for his research into the Qur'an and science) of this verse:  \\\"(God is) the One Who created the night, the day, the sun and the moon. Each is travelling in an orbit with its own motion.\\\" (Qur'an :33)  The positive aspect of this verse noted by Dr. Maurice Bucaille is that while geocentrism was the commonly accepted notion at the time (and for a long time afterwards), there is no notion of geocentrism in this verse (or anywhere in the Qur'an).\",\" I attribute my success to several factors:  Very low fat.  Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me, I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.  Very little sugar or salt.  Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are recommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard of people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are just too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)  My \\\"clean your plate\\\" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last 10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch up, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.  I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry shortly, and eating won't be practical then).  I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to stores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car. I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps build and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes runs in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable with a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if it drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess ounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim weight from the rider than from the vehicle.)  There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately, it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.  Obviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've done will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who did try it and didn't succeed.   I'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat. I usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty, my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comes off again over a week or two. --  Keith Lynch, kfl@access.digex.com\",\"  Lucky dog... :-)     It applies with equal force to earlier versions.  Presumably only recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention. The necessity it refers to has always been there, but it's been implicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of the new window.   [...]  This is because the warning you read is incomplete.  You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a border-pixel, and the problem should go away.  There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair, I'm not entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this.)       der Mouse\",\"Greetings!!

I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience can be trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something so materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess anything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we were discussing the \\\"mind\\\" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal, as it were; and half spiritual.   ?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the ?possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do ?not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of ?Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage ?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know ?that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.

Without the Church,           Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.   ?Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain ?of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they ?cannot be certain.  This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation. Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas not subject to the experimental method.   ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ?\\\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some ?

Oh, well . . .   one more thing: in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on the newer models are different from the connection used on the plus--- you're right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plus and connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. in other words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible. it's merely a matter of finding out the correct order.   omt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solution so others can, too. thanx for the input.\",\"  Wow, the WWII channel did something not-WWII?

I think the film still holds up among the best of SF films, but that isn't  saying a whole lot. \",\"                                                           ^                                                       Novell is at least                                                       demoing windows apps                                                       running under UNIXWare.                                      ^           ^                                 Try MKS.

The EMX system for OS/2 gives you most of the standard UNIX system calls for recompiling your UNIX programs under OS/2.  Not quite the same thing as actually running UNIX programs directly in either case, but EMX makes OS/2 almost as compatible with UNIX systems as many UNIX systems are with each other.  And, best of all, EMX is free.  :-)  There is a similar system (GO32) for DOS, but it doesn't work with Windows, as far as I know.   Should add in the cost for DOS with both Geos and Windows, neither of which is a standalone OS at this point.  Neither OS/2 nor UNIX requires DOS.  BTW, two of the best unices I've seen for the pee cee are UNIXWare ($300 for the personal edition) and LINUX (free).  So I don't agree that \\\"a good one costs $400-$700.\\\"  :-)  And, if you really want to check out the various options available to you, you should also look into DESQview and DESQview/X.  cheers\",\"If you haven't heard yet, US Senator Patty Murrey, a Mom in tennis shoes, is planning to introduce legislation to tax all handgun transactions and increase dealer licnese costs in order to raise money to cover the costs of un-insured shooting victums.

I heard once that the voyagers had a failsafe routine built in that essentially says \\\"If you never hear from Earth again, here's what to do.\\\"  This was a back up in the event a receiver burnt out but the probe could still send data (limited, but still some data).    Since this would be a shutdown that may never be refunded for startup, if some type of cosmic BEM took out the probe, it might not be such a big loss.  Obviously you can't plan for everything, but the most obvious things can be considered. \",\" I think this is a weak argument.  The fact is, there are *two* references to Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least been altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage says the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho for Jesus and may be authentic.    There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference to Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which lack the references.  It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but I don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in the scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes this position, but that's because he takes the very small minority view that Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not of biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to the historicity of Jesus.)\",\"Does any one out there listen to WFAN?

Perhaps the law codified it but the authorities refused to hire any homeopaths.  A similar law in the US allows chiropractors to practice in VA hospitals but I've never seen one there and I don't know of a single VA that has hired a chiropractor.

Obviously, Israeli authorities do recognize Israeli nationality for some purposes, e.g. passports, consular services, etc...  ID cards have a field of nationality which is a subdivision of the above.  Ostensibly, this field is provided for sevices provided by the religious departments of the gov't, though this is not the general case.   From its onset, Israel's borders have been shaped and reshaped by both war and peace.  As such, the Israeli gov't has always felt that defining its borders is a step that is meaningful only after peace treaties have been conluded with its neighbors.  There is no plan for \\\"ultimate borders\\\" (is this a game like \\\"ultimate frisbee\\\"?) extending into  other countries.   Aside from what Vaanunu provided, no.   If that is true, then by virtue of the question's subject, it is unanswerable.  Anyone who claims its validity. is claiming an oxymoron. That having been said, I deny the above.  You go on to ask quite a number of questions that show an obvious bias.  Questions of the sort \\\"Is it true that you entered your mother's vagina?\\\" which are based upon some kernel of truth, though phrased in a way as to render them repugnant and cast aspersions upon Israel.  Incidentally, the answer to the above is usually yes, unless you were born via a C-section. \",\"  It has been done already!

Keith  \",\"   There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago about breathing liquid. (It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.) As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:   - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out      of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own     breathing effort (let alone anything else)    - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is     expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled     is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)     So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done     by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen     tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough     oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.    - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough     gas per unit volume.     Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs or interfere with their healing or anything like that...  \",\"  I was part of a study a few years ago at the University of Arizona to see whether cross dominant individuals (those with a particular handedness but who had dominance in the opposite eye) were better hitters than those with same side dominance of hand and eye.  I was picked from my softball class because I was cross dominant (right hand, left eye) which put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to get an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people).  To control the study, she used a pitching machine - fast pitch.  Since I was used to slow pitch, I didn't come close (actually I think I foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball.  If there were a lot of people like me in her study (i.e., those who can't hit fast pitch, or are not used to hitting off a machine),  I would seriously question the results of that study!!  I think there have been some studies of major league players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to test whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was \\\"better\\\" - but I don't know the results.  (The woman who ran the study I was in said that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major leaguers than across the general population - but I'm not sure whether I'd believe her.)\",\"Archive-name: typing-injury-faq/keyboards Version: $Revision: 5.11 $ $Date: 1993/04/13 01:20:43 $  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------       Answers To Frequently Asked Questions about Keyboard Alternatives -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Alternative Keyboard FAQ Copyright 1992,1993 By Dan Wallach <dwallach@cs.berkeley.edu>  The opinions in here are my own, unless otherwise mentioned, and do not represent the opinions of any organization or vendor.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port         2. X terminals         3. NeXT         4. Silicon Graphics         5. IBM RS/6000  6. Other stuff      1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port   If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard  (Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding  a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation  runs the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used  PC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable  to your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read  the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.   The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.   a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and  even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server  extension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your  server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings  appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,  you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,  or bugging your vendor.   kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.  Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.   Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.      2. X terminals   Also, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use  PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all  set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the  trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add  extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around  for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.      3. NeXT   NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop  Bus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they  were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of  upgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!      4. Silicon Graphics   Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and  beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't  believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not  possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by  upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more  details.      5. IBM RS/6000   IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||  Unfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||  cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||  smaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||  it or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||  works.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||  told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||  anything new, please send me e-mail.        ||          6. Other stuff   Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)  support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your  queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can  get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either  from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in  luck.  Contact the companies for more details.

Availability: February, 1993     Price: $219     Supports: Mac only      Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The     keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate     backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are     arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.      The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.     A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.      The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not     directly attachable to the keyboard.

Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products.     Most (if not all) of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles     (including PS/2's and other MicroChannel boxes).  They sell you     a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number     of popular word processors and spreadsheets.      Each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions     to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  Multiple     people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file     for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.     On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between     words.  Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute.     I don't have specs on the DragonWriter 1000.      The DragonDictate-30K can recognize 30,000 words at a time.     The DragonWriter 1000 can recognize (you guessed it) 1000 words at a time.

It's a three-piece folding keyboard.  The layout resembles the     standard 101-key keyboard, except sliced into three sections.  Each     section is on a \\\"custom telescoping universal mount.\\\"  Each section     independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each     individual to type in a natural posture.  You can rearrange the three     sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).  Each     section is otherwise normal-shaped (i.e.: you put all three sections     flat, and you have what looks like a normal 101-key keyboard).

Maybe you missed it amidst the flurry of responses? Yet again, the use of this newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters they have substantial knowledge of.  For cites on MSG, look up almost anything by John W. Olney, a toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on development.  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an excitotoxic food additive, and that its major constituent, glutamate is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain (humans included).  Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrown off.  Glutamate and aspartate, also an excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts, and are freely available in many foods, but the amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single food.  By eating lots of junk food, packaged soups, and diet soft drinks, it is possible to jack your blood levels so high, that anyone with a sensitivity to these compounds will suffer numerous *real* physi9logical effects.  Read Olney's review paper in Prog. Brain Res, 1988, and check *his* sources. They are impecable.

(i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the  low gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and  would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's  another curve approaching)  3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is  depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern  electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.  this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about  to turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as  little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.  also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a 5 speed)?    how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do better.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear, low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high revs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight. \",\" No.  The idea was suggested around here during discussions of possible near-term commercial space activities.  One of the folks involved in those discussions, a spacecraft engineer named Preston Carter, passed the suggestion on to  some entreprenurial types, and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead with it.  Preston is now at LLNL, and is working with Space Marketing on  the sensors that might be carried.  Actually, that sounds unlikely.  I don't know what the launch vehicle would be, but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher -- certainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASA for, e.g.,  launch support would probably  cover NASA's incremental costs pretty well.   No, as noted, LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design, per  Clementine and related programs.  I'm sure folks around here would like to  see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure, but after all,  the U.S. did the Echo satellites long ago, and an advertising structure would not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was (or a parade balloon, for that matter).  While I happen to personally dislike the idea, mostly because I've got a background in astronomy, it's hardly vandalism -- it would be a short-lived intrusion on the night sky, doing no permanent damage and actually hurting only a small subset of astronomers.  On the other hand, it would certainly draw attention to space.     Which, unfortunately, this is not likely to contribute much to.   As far as I know, it's a purely commercial venture.  I gather it is being very seriously discussed with possible advertisers. Commercial projects, however, generally don't get \\\"funding\\\" -- they get \\\"customers\\\" -- whether it will have customers remains to be seen.  Nahh.

Unfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into emacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to change the source code so that all of these special keys generated character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier state as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence \\\"ESC [ 1 B 7\\\"  would indicate that the \\\"HOME\\\" key was pressed, with the shift key down.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such as \\\"shift-Return\\\".  If anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with it a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code in the source file \\\"x11term.c\\\".  Maybe if someone at OSF is  interested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've got bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about  emacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods  somewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it.  Notes:    * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create    its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which     includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual.   * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2    [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].

Being a PhD-student at David Chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.  The report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be retrieved from  ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)  from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA. The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.  ==================================================================== ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the representation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier systems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in both computation and communication complexity than any such system proposed previously.    Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability. Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the Diffie-Hellman problem.     Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in previously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the first place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender after the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user, which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems. Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by a simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that previous solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system can be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while retaining its computational efficiency. ====================================================================  Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!    I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as possible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to me and I will try to reply as good as I can. Any comments are also welcome!  Stefan Brands, \",\"Article 10886 of alt.radio.scanner: Path: usenet.ins.cwru.edu!cleveland.Freenet.Edu!aj008 From: aj008@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Aaron M.

In 1943, this battalion  had grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of Dro  (the butcher) who is the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5  million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council  was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was  recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily  formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the  principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the  Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination  of the Jews.  This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \\\"encore\\\" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.

I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil. spec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C and sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time delay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this application, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is disabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset. When triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x the timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can be programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it is, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K resistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of 2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !) Of course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for 256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'. After the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14 day timing cycle and so forth.  Power is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the electronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to keep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts to spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see what I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns off ;-)  Thanks again everyone...\",\"   Bobby, there's a question here that I just HAVE to ask.

Drew\",\" OK, here's at least one Christian's answer:  Jesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes sense.  Matt 5:17 \\\"Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\\\"  Jesus lived under the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises of the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey God's purposes.  Verse 18 says \\\"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law, until all is accomplished.\\\"  The key to this verse IMHO is the last  phrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, \\\"accomplished\\\" what the  Law was supposed to accomplish.    Verse 19:  \\\"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\\\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish  people about living lives under the law, this makes sense.  In general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he  must have received about \\\"doing away with the Law.\\\"  That was not  Jesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it  should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his  people all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your  heel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be \\\"doing  away with the Law\\\" because he did not honor the traditions of men as  equal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious  leaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only  God's Law.  In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law  and defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon  on the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people  understand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which  had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.  In Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the  Law in this way:  [23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being  shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore  the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be  justified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no  longer under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith  in Christ Jesus.  I believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had  served it's purpose, i.e. \\\"our tutor to lead us to Christ,\\\" and now, \\\"we are no longer under a tutor.\\\"  The law has been \\\"fulfilled\\\"  as Christ said he would do.  God, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same personality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the \\\"last will and testament\\\" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles.  It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are re-expressed in Christianity.   On the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and  Christians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes  sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to  represent the \\\"mysteries\\\" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism  representing Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8), The Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and Sunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff, Acts 20:7)  OK, That's one Christian's explanation.  I don't claim to have all these issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome other Christians to offer other alternatives.  Please excuse the long posting.

I had a few thoughts!:  \\\"Faith on its own, if not accompanied by action is dead\\\" - James 2:17  Faith is both belief and action. If I say that I am a great swimmer but I never go swimming, am I really a swimmer? and will people believe that I am? Likewise if I say I'm a Christian but I never talk to God, am I really a Christian? My faith is demonstrated by my action. The fact that we talk to God proves we have faith. Satan believes in God but does not follow Him!  In a similar vein, I have recently been challenged by 1John2:3-6 v3 says \\\"We know that we have come to know Him if we obey His commands\\\" I find this verse quite encouraging as it could imply that 'if we have come to know Him, then we'll obey His commands' cos He lives within us and we cannot help but obey what He says. I tend to feel that as we daily submit ourself to God He will keep changing us into the likeness of Jesus and His fruit and works will be automatically produced in our lives.

Moreover, none of  the histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using  homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that Hitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse official history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts right. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in a coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of homosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it is possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubt it - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his former right hand man was a homosexual?).   Anyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references  to the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the  night of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even  the Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case,  this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the  1920's.   Ah, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the paranoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with  homosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know  what tainted \\\"evidence\\\" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made  by persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those  accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the  1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in  time and plant \\\"tainted\\\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers  which were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being  obvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter do you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in  these matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a  false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point  here seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof  falls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework  before making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.   This is just about the *only* thing we agree on.   I suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and  his SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this must be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what lies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If  you really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them  and ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from  their footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and tracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my specialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my time trying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.   Given that you already consider all evidence \\\"tainted\\\", what on earth would constitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been considered \\\"shrewd guesses\\\"?  I suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) - historians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious  footnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually  provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place  to start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.  I'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already.

Jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or police monitors, are essentially making the claim that there is no other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor.   The results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed. The federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts have sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdiction and sometimes they have not.  A lot of state courts do not have enough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides avoiding law enforcement action for speeding.

That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have made any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying that they are infallible.  Impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will probably agree.  In short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning, then those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved, there is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing \\\"There is no way out of the loop.\\\"   Someone called `REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but he did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase Sartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to relativism.  As I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false because you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because   However, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX' has written does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he does not like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it.   *  There were two sentences in `REXLEX's post that seemed relevant to the point at hand:   I do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  I have, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I don't claim to be infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I do claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.  However, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about them, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlier article.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted in very limited circumstances.    But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.  For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said, exactly, \\\"This is my body.\\\"  We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.  At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Why should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be fallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?  So, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is that Jesus said \\\"This is my body.\\\"  Beyond that, once we start making up doctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we get into trouble.  Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they cannot be certain.    That is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us know that human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do not believe we are infallible, any more than we do.  When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you are either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying to cover them up.  I think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what things we are only \\\"very confident\\\" of.  For example, we might say that we know our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  But other things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical thinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are very confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.  But, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting as if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous.   *  `REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by Francis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of it, but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebody else might like it, though, so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.  If someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On Certainty_, by Ludwig Wittgenstein. \",\"  I didn't mean to offend or anything, I'm just quoting Stanky himself on the subject.

The structure  of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but  fighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have  comfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't really have the former,  in the long term, unless you have the latter.  One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird  cross between a libertarian and an \\\"establishment tool\\\" is that I end up  taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when  the government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my  lifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.    As a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government  to be \\\"fair\\\".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed,  whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the  government would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem.   What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal,  so much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong)  sense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth  it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its  citizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the  major architects of the American system of government, figured that in a  couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it  would be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.

There was no elaboration as to where specfically the item was found, of what type of wrench it was, but the anchorperson did say something about a NASA official commenting that there would be an inquiry into how the thing got in the SSRB.

 Either the government has force available to it, or it doesn't.  The Libertarian position is that the government can use force only when someone else uses force first -- even when that first force is not directed against the government, but one of its citizens.  That all being true,  what safeguards do we have against the government CLAIMING that some initiation of force on its part is really a response?  (Like the burning of the Maine, the Tonkin Gulf incident, or the assault on Waco?)  I ask this not to argue, but to understand.  (Followups to alt.politics.libertarian only.) -- \",\"The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly had with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and commercial space.  This is how it went...    After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO, I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard the gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour. Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.  We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide, who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not bozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to  make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.  Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking to him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening. We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.   Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another woman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that we brought up.  But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate aligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space. So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to LEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming  feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that. We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism paper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog over L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is  more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to  understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education  whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other fields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday  would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.  We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal communicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided in those sectors.  Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc.. We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.  We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order to make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.  We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are proceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the results from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan), and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along the lines of lowering the cost to LEO.  In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data  Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it. He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it, and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually happen immediatly there.  The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they could feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know the answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who really did know the answers.  Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He said that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this would be something that she would be very interested in, although they do have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the state 1 week out of 6 these days.

Kilpela              email mkilpela@mtu.edu Michigan Technological University School of Technology\",\" The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and  exploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians  in any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently.  The idea that \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi citizens died is ludicrous.  Not even \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi soldiers died, and they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians? Either the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did), or they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to destroying Iraq's military potential.  The military mission planners are not fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war. Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you, not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrant-dictator.   How about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2? I don't hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but with smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are misidentified; innocents die.  That's war the way it really is. But the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like it's one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is worse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, \\\"I know not what course others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!\\\"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wishes to stay free.      Mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here. You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I feel sure that was not your intent.  So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I'm sure that appeasement would have worked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we shouldn't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor  French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We  should have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you'd be speaking German instead of English right now.  Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don't understand diplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is that Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad, so now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice (not to mention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait  was a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would've been better!  And as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why* the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of \\\"not guilty\\\"? Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape. But the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I have not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen.    Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused, whether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one's guilt, and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism.         Regards,\",\"   Hello, I know that this has been discussed before.  But at the time I didn't need to teselate a sphere.

Only one blinker is used.  Note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the string 1 bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs in parallel with it.  That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing and the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open, this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the strings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.   Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get one.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these draw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.  What you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light  at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current  from the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing  both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a  low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow  at reduced brightness. \",\" I find this method much better myself, too, although I do really hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my hand both come crashing into my face.

Here is some  information \\\"from the horse's mouth\\\".  (Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media (\\\"clearing\\\") meant to  be *retained* within the controlled environment, or declassifying  the material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment,)  From National Telecommunications and Information Systems  Security (NTISS) \\\"Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation  Security Guidelines\\\"  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87):  ------  \\\"7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk,  cassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the  entire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be  cleared by applying a vendor's formatting program that overwrites  each location with a given character.  Fixed media (e.g., Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting  at least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by  applying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each  location on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that  this program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware:  some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not  actually do this.  Cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or  released for destruction; however, they should be marked and  controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of  information ever recorded.  7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media can be declassified using a  degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of  that type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.)  If a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is  operative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to  employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all  addressable locations at least three times by writing any character,  then its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros)  alternatively.  When fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify  the media by the overwrite method.  In this case, there are two  alternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk  pack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved  degaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the  vendor's facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter)  removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for  destruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new  platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit.  7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media\\\"  [see DoD Computer Security Center, \\\"Department of Defense Magnetic  Remanence Security Guideline\\\", CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE  ONLY]  ------  This and many other interesting documents (many that are more  informative than probably intended) on computer security procedures  can be obtained (free) from:  Executive Secretary National Telecommunications and Informations   Systems Security Committee National Security Agency Fort George G.

ESPN had prior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had contracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV deal was very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this one-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the season started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by squeezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota game) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball telecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last night).  But the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.

A TTL gate has the basic structure of AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is just exactly ONE gate delay.  The reason to find a minimal sum of products is that this matches a hardware optimization.   A positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) has TWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term) so that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can  be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world. ECL is similar to TTL, in that it can support an OR/AND gate with the minimum delay (unlike TTL, you get both true and inverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL).   PALs are basically large programmable AND/OR/INVERT gates (with your choice of internal connections between the various sections, and perhaps some latches), so a minimum sum of products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into  a few PALs.  It's not comparably easy to design with a minimization of logic gates, but some software packages claim to allow you to do so, and will take just about any mess of gates (as a nodelist with 74xxx series logic ICs) and produce a description of a logic cell array to do the same job.  Xilinx's XACT software does this by treating each logic block as a macro, and expanding it all out, then simplifying.\",\"Hi, all. This is my first posting, so be gentle...

No fancy modulation scheme, just : wide FSK for use at 902 or 1296 MHz.  : I'm a bit familiar with the Motorola 3362 chip, but I wonder if there : are newer designs that might work at higher input frequencies.  : My goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver \\\"back : end\\\" with IF input on one end and an FSK demondulator on the other.  I'm : particularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than 10.7 -- do any : current chips work up to, say 150MHz with internal downconversion so a : normal IF filter can be used?  : Any suggestions?  : John    What you describe is very close to what I built and described in the 10th ARRL Computer Network Conference proceedings.    I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentially double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz. The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used previouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.    The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used at these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design of this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).    While using this would have let me reduce the \\\"external\\\" IF count on receive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I didn't bother with it.    The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2 MHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios actually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and speed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data stream is another matter entirely.    Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a \\\"beacon\\\" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO also shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even though the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes of the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of a second.    I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the proceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running low on resources of time, money and energy.    If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW ID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma Mtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally polarized.    I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and you might want to carefully consider your \\\"target\\\".  If you can't arrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think you'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by multipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS. For more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spread spectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems. I'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.  73 Glenn Elmore n6gn\",\"   Why not?  Ford owns Aston-Martin and Jaguar, General Motors owns Lotus and Vauxhall.

'Easter' is a pagan word all right, but it has nothing to do with Ishtar. If 'Easter' and 'Ishtar' were related, their history would show it. But in Old English, Easter was 'Eostre', cognate with English 'East' and German 'Ost'.   The reconstructed Proto-Germanic form is 'Austron'. Not until after 1400 did 'Easter' have a high front vowel like 'Ishtar'. Clearly, the two words have quite separate origins.  There may be neo-pagans who worship Ishtar at Easter, but if so, they are making either a mistake of etymology, or a deliberate play on words.  -- Michael Covington  (Ph.D., linguistics)   \",\": Is there a fix for this?

Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by  performing studies that are \\\"blind\\\" in various ways.  Some of these are:    o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a       placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the      control group or the test group.    o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects       receive a placebo or the test treatment.    o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects      receive a placebo or the test treatment.  Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to  differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis is quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on which it is based so that others can verify it.    It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because those who performed the study did not \\\"blind\\\" themselves.  It is not considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already are, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested, the control and test groups are treated alike.\",\" Yeah.

The first one is Ray (or half line) method. In this method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd, then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache.  The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then it is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.  My experience tells the second method is relible.  Hope this helps.\",\"Hai,  In a few days I'm going to buy a new motherboard with local-bus(ses).

Hamas figures significantly in the Middle East equation. In December, Israel deported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response to Hamas's kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longer version appears in the May issue of Harper's Magazine, which obtained and translated the tape.)        My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finished high school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to work for Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I'm married and I have two daughters.      The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine explicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern is Palestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men and women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli] Security Services.      Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation, cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our most important objective must be to put an end to the plague of collaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose the methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into collaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally, we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.      We don't execute every collaborator. After all, about 70 percent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into their misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator is based on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like many collaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli Border Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once. He's as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like an Israeli soldier.      There's another group of collaborators who perform an even more loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become collaborators. I regard the \\\"isqat\\\" [the process by which a Palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious duty to execute him.      A third group of collaborators is responsible for the distribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the Security Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and impossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the drugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.      In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of uncovering collaborators, We can't afford to abduct an innocent person, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished forever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after evidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. If after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any doubt, then he is executed.      In many cases, we don't have to make our evidence against collaborators public, because everyone knows that they're guilty. But when the public isn't aware that a certain individual is a collaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for evidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be irrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usually obtained in the form of a confession.      At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we start off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tell him that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the last moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the information we need.      We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has been a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of them confess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we apply pressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdouts confess as well.      Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an interrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen working for the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himself confessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the information to us. In addition, three members of his network of collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With this much evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we are very careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, our principal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he himself confesses his crimes.       A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be executed without interrogation. An although we had hundreds of names, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could not mark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, for execution.      When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. But after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can't shoot him -- to do so might give away our locations. That's why collaborators are strangled. Sometimes we ask the collaborator, \\\"What do you think? How should we execute you?\\\" One collaborator told us, \\\"Strangle me.\\\" He hated the sight of blood. \",\"Hi,  I am buying a Quantum LPS240AT 245 MB hardisk and is deciding a  HDD/FDD controller.

Those scholars did indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I recently checked several Lexicons:   \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Louw and Nida  \\\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\\\"  \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Grimm  \\\"Word study Concordance,\\\" Tynsdale  \\\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other    early Christian Writings,\\\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich  \\\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\\\" Perschbacher  A couple simply stated \\\"hanged oneself\\\", and a couple were more explicit  and stated that \\\"apacgw\\\" means specifically \\\"kill yourself by hanging.\\\" A couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for \\\"apacgw\\\" is \\\"strangle, throttle or choke\\\" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who suggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best references though, \\\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the literal translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give further context).    The word \\\"apagchw\\\" has two root words: \\\"gchw\\\" is the \\\"to strangle\\\" root, and the root word \\\"apo\\\" means literally \\\"away.\\\" This root words is included in words which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the greek word \\\"apagello\\\" means to send a message).  \\\"Apo\\\" can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson specifically makes comparison to the word \\\"apokteiuo,\\\" which means \\\"to kill.\\\" In literal meaning the word \\\"apacgw\\\" means \\\"to throttle, strangle to put out of the way,\\\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from life, to death).  So while the word \\\"apacgw\\\" does mean \\\"to hang,\\\" it specifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he state that it means \\\"to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging.\\\" He then notes the the use of \\\"apacgw\\\" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He presents that example of \\\"apacgw\\\" as being used to explicitly mean \\\"suicide by hanging.\\\" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the added denotation of \\\"death,\\\" and as you insist that the Bible was written by God, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete meaning of \\\"apacgw\\\" (ie: Since the word \\\"apacgw\\\" was used, then death is denoted as the result).   By the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of \\\"apacgw\\\":   Note Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to Greek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\\\" the the Hebrew say \\\"and died\\\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek.  It should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \\\"and died\\\", the correct translation would still be \\\"apacgw,\\\" as the man did indeed die from strangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the Septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions which contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily executed by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it now stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove your point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing \\\"apacgw\\\" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence.   Now I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus, I think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above what the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or historical source to justify it.   By the way, as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field:   Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that there are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description of the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two thousand years ago (after all, things change).   Now as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same as the 30 silvers:   True, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas' betrayal \\\"an iniquity,\\\" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas' actions \\\"an iniquity\\\" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took      \\\"Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling      him \\\"Buy what we need for the feast\\\"; or that he should give something      to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and      it was night.\\\"  Note that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money box.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose the a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different book, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by the author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived.   Of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen evidence that \\\"apacgw\\\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging was successful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie: Passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself the next day.  Thus the money which bought the \\\"Field of Blood\\\" would have to have been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver that night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.  Oh dear, I believe that the house of cards is comming down).   Maybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on Friday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.  By the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from (ie: the mention of it in Matthew), you say:   I am reminding you now to discuss it now. It's all part of the same verse we are discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping  these issues.       Later,      Dave Butler   A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.     David Hume, Philosopher     An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding\",\" just picked out this one point because it struck me.... why do you believe this?  muslims believe in many of the same things that christians and jews believe; they believe jesus, while not the messiah, is a prophet.  this seems to me to be much closer to christianity than other religions are.  (then again i tend to be somewhat liberal about others' beliefs.)  this also relates to the serbian \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" question.  i have been waiting for condemnations of this and have seen very few.  HOW can we stand by and watch innocent people, even people whose beliefs we condemn, if this is the case (and don't get me wrong, the things fundamenalist muslims have to say about women make my blood boil), be tortured, raped (the stories about that made me physically ill), and killed?  jesus loves all, not just those who love him back -- and he would advocate kindness toward them (in the hopes of converting them, if that's the way you want to put it) rather than killing them.    i'm sorry i got off the subject here -- maybe i should have used a different title.  i did need to get this off my chest, however.  peace (shalom), vera shanti _______________________________________________________________________________ Hand over hand    noye@midway.uchicago.edu Doesn't seem so much   (Vera Noyes) Hand over hand     Is the strength of the common touch drop me a line if you're in the mood  - Rush, \\\"Hand Over Fist\\\" _______________________________________________________________________________  [I am also worried about this issue.  I've made a posting under my own name earlier today.  I do not much want to discuss Moslem beliefs here.  This isn't the right group for it.  Their beliefs about Jesus appear to come as much from the Koran as the Bible.  This means that while they honor him, what they think he did and stood for differs in many ways from Christian beliefs about him.  But Moslem beliefs are an appropriate topic for soc.religion.islam.  As I'm sure you know, many Christians believe that you must accept Christ in order to be saved.  While Stanley's comment appears to be anti-Moslem, I would assume he would say the same thing about all religions other than Christianity.\",\"   Very interesting, but I also believe that you have presented a misleading argument.  Christianity is not the cause of the massacres and horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the fault of people who misunderstand Jesus Christ's message, and modify it to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter their ambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in the New Testament.  With every truthful and good message that carries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitable fact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distorted way, with inevitable consequences.  The Bible's message is that we are to love all people, and that all people are redeemable.  It preaches a message of repentance, and of giving.  Unfortunately, all people have deceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this message around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways. This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine.  One of the problems is that you look at the world through the eyes of Western history.  I think that you will find many, many cases of massacres that were instigated by people who never claimed they were Christian.  I am not saying this to justify the massacres that were, but I am merely pointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already.  Consider the world without Christianity.  I doubt that we would have the same freedoms in the countries in which we live, if it wasn't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ. Perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion (I won't name any here, though one comes to mind) which would not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such subjects.  Point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for power, greed and hatred.  Please don't point the blame at a message which preaches fundamental giving and denial, in love for others.  Yours in Christ,  Andrew McVeigh   p.s. I believe that a line of questioning like you presented is, strangely enough, compatible with becoming a Christian. Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviour of the world, and especially Christians.  I praise God for Jesus Christ, and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs and still come back to God and be forgiven, time and time again.  -- ***** \",\"Hi I need a one way flight ticket from Des Moines to Chicago on the 28th of May 1993.  please send your replies to jasonlim@iastate.edu or to this account as soon as possible thank you \",\"   Well, before we start calling the Engineering folks in France a bunch of braindeads for this...

The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or the Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flip through them.  Distributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics, etc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves where we only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy by the hundreds or more.

My opinion, FWIW, to all:  Mark, age doesn't matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays better than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las Vegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major league hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have the league data from the mid-80s to check it out.  That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to start the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league season in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very poorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill are not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers, they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around .220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on the Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at any level, at any age, doesn't satisfy MY standards of evidence.

Granted, I thought his behavior with McCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first time he ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But he has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is more valuable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24), had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor, EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF (which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15 best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching his \\\"prime\\\" season of 27.

No : reasonable alternative exists.  I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime;  causes precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be an answer to \\\"how\\\" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from  \\\"nothing\\\", science has some good candidates for an answer.  I have always wondered why Christians use the \\\"There are questions science (or atheism) cannot answer\\\" argument; I hope this is the appropriate group to ask this question.  The most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the universe exist, or anything, for that matter?  I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely  1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?  and  2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?  It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However, is it a meaningful question, after all?  I would say it isn't. Consider the following:  A die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt one's very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else - I cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me - can I ever be sure I exist?  However, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone insert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )  A being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence. A being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would be pointless - the being would exist anyway.  Let us return to the original question: why? A being that does not exist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being is not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let us assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity postulate). The question \\\"why anything exists\\\" can be countered by demanding answer to a question \\\"why there is nothing in nothingness, or in non-existence\\\". Actually, both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist don't exist. Tautology at its best.  I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.  Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.  Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence. This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence, it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence. This argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists, and from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence. I think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.  The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.  The second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing? belongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the question can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge from vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent Hawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe, World Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more appropriate for discussions like this.   : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \\\"why\\\".  That isn't : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).  This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \\\"how\\\", not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \\\"why\\\" questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.   : I believe the \\\"genetic code\\\" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes, : but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining,  : reproducing life, *ever*.  (I've never been much of a prophet, though. I : can't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don't believe *any* : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.  This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?  There is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created, although not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolution contain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, although their code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent book  Steven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. Jonathan Cape, London 1992.  Artificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no  spark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do not violate any physical laws as we know them.   : You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your : research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you : really have nothing to worry about, eh?  Exactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelical atheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to  find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. I would normally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc, but it seems many Christians do not read these groups.

A few of their most whomped-up diesel trucks, maybe, load permitting.  The military surplus stuff I've driven -- \\\"Jeep Classic\\\" (Willys/Kaiser/AMC, pre-independent suspension) and Power Wagons (Slant 6 in a crew-cab pickup) weren't exactly congenial at highway speeds, and I wouldn't swear any of them would do 80 except as a bedload on a semi.  You just gotta love the standard military tire, too, or at least the one they used to use.

But the point made by Wharfie and others still stands:  if you're going to do 80 in a mil-spec '58 Power Wagon (or a Jeep or a tank transporter or other unwieldy rubber-tired vehicle) anywhere, I'd suggest the American interstate.

The first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max Friz's famous design, but with an overhead \\\"point cam\\\" (see below for more on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground clearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so that the ground clearance was substantially increased:         ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)                  Viking motor (front) ->   \\\\=@=/  This is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved around a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn in the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting rods to accomodate the stroke.  The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still unique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and and extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was required to drive both overhead valves.  Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a pressurized stream of oil to power the \\\"waterwheel\\\" which kept the lobe spinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal engineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to normal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random, resulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the beast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to pressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however, uses an electric oil pump. Wimps).  Despite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This was feasible because it was a racing engine.  With just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers because of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an almost perfect point:                      /\\\\                    /()\\\\   <-lobe                   / XX \\\\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to  valvestems ->   / \\\\  / \\\\    complexity)                 |  |   | |                 |  |===| |                     =0=  <---piston                      |                              Note that the tip was not truly vertical                              (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the                              ground, and this drawing doesn't show the                              curvature because there was none in the                              head itself. The bore curve would start                              about where the cylinder bore disappears in                              this diagram   The effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of the day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of finned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the name.  The Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it worked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary technology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that racing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines were raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate (approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two Springers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and down that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern record of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle historians discount this story.

The answers I received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working. However, during this process I have come up with new problems.  1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic string. Is this inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS or VB?  2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the DDE SQL command, (provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names) but how is one meant to update a database?    a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.    b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command from VB cannot       be used because when the macro requests information from VB using a       second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time- outs occur.       (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access to VB channel       is initiated, I guess.)    c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.      The way I eventually managed to update a database was by sending key-    strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. This technique has    the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a    state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB sends.  Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect assumptions? Are there any better work arounds to the above? Are there any signs of an ODBC driver for Access?\",\"In my postings I have made a proposal for comments and discussion. Those who don't want to discuss its merits and drawbacks are not forced to do so.  However I would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass in a personal manner, legally responsible for their deeds. I cannot accept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and I urge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect threats.  PS: My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics. It has to do with the search for peace which would enable justice. I don't consider that justice is done, when non-Jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967 are not permitted to return to their homeland. This can at best be called pragmatism, a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong. It can never be called justice. And peace without justice will never be peace. It is my conviction that the situation in which a state, through the law, attempts to discourage mixed marriages (as Israel does), is not normal. Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than Western democracies, such as the United States, in which Jews are free to marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands. My proposal may have drawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything, just to compensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy endure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the day will come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society, in which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic affiliation of its constituency, such a Fund would not be needed any more. I don't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their traditions, why not ? But this is not the affairs of a state. Western democracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain that most American Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed Christian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW.  I would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional, infantile outbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect Judaism are uncivilized. Such behaviour is not good for Judaism.\",\"  See, we are disagreeing on the definition of moral here.  Earlier, you said that it must be a conscious act.  By your definition, no instinctive behavior pattern could be an act of morality.  You are trying to apply human terms to non-humans.  I think that even if someone is not conscious of an alternative, this does not prevent his behavior from being moral.   I try to show it, but by your definition, it can't be shown.  And, morality can be thought of a large class of princples.  It could be defined in terms of many things--the laws of physics if you wish.  However, it seems silly to talk of a \\\"moral\\\" planet because it obeys the laws of phyics.

Once again, the Admirals are an independent franchise, and the people of Milwaukee have been supporting them well.  The games I have been to have seen crowds anywhere from 10,000 to 13,000, which are numbers some NHL teams (i.e. the Islanders, Hartford, New Jersey) would be envious of having on some nights.

All humanitarian, constitutional human rights guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums, documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.  The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace.  The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.  Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland. Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan. Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives  of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.  One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection  of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance, for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled, its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over  the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the USSR and the United States.   One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent  events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on Azerbaijan.  It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we  are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic  Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.  But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000 Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the  neighboring lands.  The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales, suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.  But what about the lives of seven million human beings? If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their  colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other attributes?  All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.    THE COMMITTEE FOR PEOPLE'S HELP TO                  KARABAKH (OF THE) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES                  OF THE AZERBAIJAN SSR   But perhaps Turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the Caucasus in the name of peace and democracy. The Armenians are Christians, the Azerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved by the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights.   Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims at 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole thing has now gone entirely too far.   They already did. The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians  78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this  time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the  plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs.   Report taken from The New York Times, Tuesday, March 3, 1992                      MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED       Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today  of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh,  a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.      The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed 1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and  massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered mountain passes.      But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani reports of a massacre.                           Scalping Reported      Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them  from retrieving more bodies.      \\\"Women and children have been scalped,\\\" said Assad Faradshev, an aide to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. \\\"When we began to pick up bodies, they began firing at us.\\\" are lying there like flocks of sheep.

They were all men, and a few had been wearing khaki uniforms.

I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture using a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one (1.5).     They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite nicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by 3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he increased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps.      Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't know what model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an LCII.     Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having a little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!  This was from memory!     Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some hardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the  animation (like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator?)?     Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.     But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I can claim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in  my computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.     But I agree, if we consider MPEG stuff, I think a multimedia consumer low-priced box has a lot of market... I just think 3DO would make it,  no longer CD-I. \",\"ARIANESPACE FLIGHT 56  (Flight V.56 was originally intended to carry the Hughes HS-601 series  Galaxy IV satellite, but the payload was withdrawn just prior to flight.)  The 56th Ariane launch is now scheduled to place the ASTRA 1C and ARSENE  satellites into an improved geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), with  inclination reduced to 5 degrees and apogee altitude increased by 150 km. This will be the 28th launch of an Ariane 4 and the first in the 42L  configuration, with 2 liquid strap-on boosters (PAL).  It will be launched from the newly refurbished Ariane launch complex ELA 2, in Kourou - French  Guiana.  The launch vehicle performance requirement for this mission is 3,147 kg of which 2,944 kg represents the satellite mass.  The total vehicle mass at liftoff is 361,778 kg.

This mission will likely be carried in the US on Galaxy 6, however it could be Galaxy 7 or another satellite. (What is the European satellite normally used for Ariane coverage?)  \",\"    Are you trying to say that there were no massacres in Deir Yassin    or in Sabra and Shatila? If so then let me tell you some good jokes:     There is not and was not any such thing like jewish killing in WWII     Palestinians just did what Davidians did for fourty years and more.     In fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place.     People die that is all. No one gets killed.     Maybe also vietamiese didn't die in Vietnam war killed by american    napalm they were just pyromaniacs and that's all.     Maybe jews just liked gas chambers and no one forced them to get in there.they     may be thought it was like snifing cocaine. No?     What do you think of this ? Isn't it stupid to say so?    Well it is as stupid as what you said .Next time you want to lie do it    intelligently.     Sincerely yours.     Hassan  Arab civilians did die at Dir yassin. But there was no massacre. First of all, the village housed many *armed* troops. Secondly, the Irgun and Stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians. The village was attacked only for its military significance. In fact, a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before the attack was to begin.  By all rational standards, Dir Yassin was not a massacre. The killing was unintentional. The village housed Arab snipers and Arab troops. Thus it was attacked for its military significance. It was not attacked with intentions of killing any civilians.  To even compare Dir Yassin, in which some 120 or so Arabs died, to the Holocaust is absurd. The Irgun did not want to kill any civilians. The village had almost 1000 inhabitants, most of whom survived.\",\"ites:  Yeah, and the cop couldn't catch me.....\",\"Archive-name: space/groups Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:08 $  SPACE ACTIVIST/INTEREST/RESEARCH GROUPS AND SPACE PUBLICATIONS      GROUPS      AIA -- Aerospace Industry Association.

We have biblical accounts of both his mother's ancestry and his father's, both tracing back to David.  It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that Jesus was Semitic.  As an interesting aside, Jesus' being semitic makes him neither \\\"white\\\" nor \\\"black,\\\" and in some sense underscores the point made earlier that his color was not important, it was his message, his grace, and his divinity that we should concentrate on.  Finally, I would direct anyone interested in African involvement in the church to the account of the conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts chapter 9 (I think it's chapter 9).  This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch, treasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely African.  Because \\\"Ethiopia\\\" at that time indicated a region just south of Egypt, many also speculate that this man was not only the first African Christian, but the first black Christian as well.

Mr. Bill\",\" [FAQ and Darius' response deleted]    I am myself an SDA and I am in total agreement with what Darius has to say.   I also worship on Saturday to honor the Lord.  Your mention of \\\"[esteeming]  all days alike\\\" IMO has to do with the fast days observed by the Jews.  But  no matter how you interpret that passage, I do accept your worship on Sunday  as being done in honor of the Lord, in contrast with what many of my fellow  SDA believers may believe.  To me, though, the bible overwhelmingly points  to Saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of God's  deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.  To those who would  attempt to point out that my observance of Saturday is being legalistic,  this is simply not the case.  Rather, keeping Saturday allows me a full day  to rest and contemplate God's goodness and grace.    The idea was introduced to me once that the reason Paul wanted the  Corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the first day of the  week was because that was when they received their weekly wages.  Paul  wanted them to lay aside money for the collection as first priority, before  spending their money on other things.  I do not have any proof in front of  me for this though, although it would explain why they would lay aside money  in their homes instead of a meeting.     It would seem to me that you assume that the christians in the NT regularly  worshipped on the first day.  I assume that the christians in the NT  regularly worshipped on the seventh day.  But I agree with you that we only  have implications because the authors did assume the reader knew when worhip  was.\",\"  Make that 20%.

The hockey team is attracting arena site proposals from Broward, Dade,  and Palm Beach counties.

If it has already been posted, I apologize.  It seems that during the Middle Ages, it was customary for pastors to  explain the Trinity to their parishoners by analogy to water. Water is water, but can exist in three forms--liquid, ice and vapor. Thus it is possible for one essence to exist in three forms.  And recently, the pastor of my church drew an analogy, which I also found useful--A woman is often percieved by others in three ways, depending on their relationship to her--a mother, a wife and an employee in a business.

VESA  also defines local bus and other standards.   The VESA standard only addresses ways in which an application  can find out info and capabilities of a specific super VGA  implementation and to control the video mode selection  and video memory access.   You still have to set your own pixels.    VESA defines a \\\"window\\\" that is used to access video memory.  This window is anchored at the spot where you want to write,  and then you can write as far as the window takes you (usually  64K).  Windows have granularities, so you can't just anchor   them anywhere.  Also, some implementations allow two windows.    This is VESA mode 101h.  There is a Set Display Start function  that might be useful for scrolling.    Your best bet is to write VESA for the info.

The ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if you're grounded in some other way at the same time.    The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly  measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.    They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere, repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things like sub-panels.)  What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact, depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.  There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and news.answers.

About 20 years ago, _National Lampoon_ had some comic strips  in them that were drawn by Neal Adams. They were called \\\"Son o' God\\\" comics.  It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible. In the comic, there were a  group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn, and when one of them said  the magic word, he turned into \\\"Son o' God.\\\" He went from a myopic,  curly headed, yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied  portraits of Jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile  features.    Now, if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus,  and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this  NatLamp Jesus, we would have to say that this was fallacious since  this Jesus was a fabrication, and did not really exist.   This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim  that they are Christian.

Enough people have been killed by rubber bullets that they now use them under only certain \\\"controlled\\\" circumstances.  And they are fired from something that looks like a tear gas launcher.  There are smaller rubber bullets and pellets (for shotguns).  I understand that they are only intended to be discouragers, ie. for the snapping but not truly dangerous animal.  In general, they do not seem capable of really stopping someone who wants you or past you.  They are fired at very low muzzle velocity (the .38 ball round is intended for a 400fps load).

The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise, since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time.  In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable. Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings, say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses the body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver. If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde, it is actually relatively non-toxic. \",\"You can't.

It's amazing how everyone automatically blames one side or the other.  One thing for sure:  Koresh will have no chance to defend himself  against the statements (lacking in fact or COurt sponsored verification)  made  by agents who participated in the situation that killed him.    I don't know they murdered him; I also don't know   that the Branch Davidians set a fire and suicidede.    It is SICK of BATF or FBI spokepeople to make such   comments in advance of forensic pathology.   Stephen:  thank you.  God speed.      Yah.    BINGO.  Am I the only one  to notice:  a) No peaceful attempt to serve a warrant.  b) Six months to develop a scene and six days to end it?  c) .... ah God:     25 children    at least 64 adults    plus 6 at the beginning    and more BATF agents     all dead.    Has anyone asked themselves these questions:   1)  Have you seen the ENTIRE video sequences taken during the    opening rounds?  I seem to recall missing several key parts:   a)  The first five minutes of day one; only the shooting     part comes out.   b)  What happened to the Feds video units?  You mean they do     not carry helmet cams?  Wonder why not?  2)   How is it you can have camera crews with live transmission    video present and NOT have an uninterrupted record?    a)  You realize the units carry ittle bitty 8mm backups?    That hold 90 minutes per unit?  And there are    twounits on the professional handhelds (so no    tape turnover gaps)?   b)  Until all views are seen, it is premature to point    fingers in either direction.   As you well point out, Stephen.    More on this below.    Yes.  But it is so hard toremain human under the full  pressure of hazard, game playing, and life.    More to the point:  when someone dies (almost like it was intended  that way), both sides will kill to maintain their innocence --   a contradiction in terms.    True.  Usually I pick the unpopular side and point out  from the evidence seen what might have alternatively happened.    This requires someone interested in God's Will.  Please note  that the outstanding _overt_ problem in this country today  is one where the Government:    wants Caesar's coin to pay off the debt.    Yes:  The AMerican People.  Not the Federal Government.  ANd if it is not spent towards that end, _no_one_ deserves  the coin.     Yah.

The onyl good thing to come out of my divorce (and my  exposure to the Damned (pardon me) American Divorce Attorney  is:    I have no money left to lose to taxes or inflation.    25 children dead.  If anyone thinks blaming Koresh -- or the BATF  helps this any at all, is sick.  and wrong.    The reason you can tell that the BATF may not be entirely   straight on this is that the leaders at press conferences   havew made ANY comments about even the POSSIBILITY that   Koresh or his followers caused this.    The BATF agentss are more concerned with their repuations   and morals (\\\"not my fault, Koresh did it!\\\") than they   are with:     25 dead children.   Same goes for Koresh & his followers - who are all (mostly) dead.    More on power and favoritism.  (My personal opinion).   Look to history:  whenever privilege has replaced whatever  token of objective law and justice a society has had,    Hitlerrs have followed.    You do your name sake proud, Stephen.  Its hard, but please keep on keeping on:   each voice in the wilderness now will   save a generation unborn from horror    The day I _need_ a gun or abomb to protect myself in this  society is the day that society is already beyond redemption    and that aint' redundant, if you have any Christian   belief aytall.   ... and the day that I cannot peacefully enjoin others in the  act that Thoreau called Civil Disobedience to rectify the  wrongs that my society practises, without undue harm or  punishment befalling me, is the day that society has ceased to  be a human society, and become a society of animals.    We are _very_ cclose to that.    Six years fighting an unjust COurt issue:  still struggling to be  patient.  For those who like contrary questions:   NB:  I was not there.  I am not a Branch Davidian nor a     law  official hater.  I do hate liars or the six letter variety of same.  The official side has its advocates already; lets balance the  equation and asj a few questions on the other side, for the sake  of an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass:    innocent until proven guilty.  not   innocent until presumed guilty.   1)  Where are the video tapes from the tanks?  ALL of them.    Don't tell me they do not exist.  They are standard   equipment.   2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?    a)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This     aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable     as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.     .... gotcha!      ... when in isolation from other substances.      WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote     launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce \\\"this window,     blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come     down\\\", and maintain a left to right sequence?    b)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when     mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)     suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to     brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long     exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend     to ignite.     What other chemicals come up in the forensics?    Who else will be allowed to test the site?    c)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation     rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made     to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature     above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain     heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length     of time (start a wall fire and wait).     Check your military records; look at the tapes.    Why were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),    tear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why    the hurry. was there still a comm channel open    to the outside?).     Do you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the    compound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which ones    are missing?   Do I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not.  You trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement?   IN advance of a Court?  God help us.    (For we are surely not helping ourselves).  You trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate?    You are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting.   Look again.   Did it happen that way?  I do not know.  I was not there.   AND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO DECIDE.  But will that happen?  89 people will NOT have the chance   to tell their side as the BATF leader was, on camera.  No one wins.  Except:  more force next time.   Listen to your hearts, people.

However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the center.  (These measurements are statistical, and you can always hide a sufficiently small number of a different type of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming that there is only one population of GRBs).  The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center of the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets way beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing GRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to be released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.  If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy) you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of the Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center (for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if they are Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in radius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, the Earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.   The aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don't see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.   There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature. Right now, the theorists have a sort of unofficial moratorium on new models until new observational evidence comes in. \",\"Is posible to make copies of these photographs (or any other aerospace photographs at NASM) if you pay a copyright fee?\",\"taken.

I think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court. Currently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones, record calls without listening to them, and then post-facto obtain warrants and listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But this strategy wouldn't get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not in the near term.)  In other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence inadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to interpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I'd be surprised that archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything but analogous to a wiretap by the courts.  Note that that doesn't mean I think it won't be done if technically feasible.  Just as I'm sure many wiretaps are done now without warrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future, start surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause, decrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation gets a boost from data that, sadly, won't ever be presented to a jury.  While I'm posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this archiving scenario to extremes, read \\\"Lacey and his Friends\\\", a collection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the slippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don't worry folks, it's stored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can get to it.  And by the way, we'll be installing cameras on all major streets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and teller machines, don't we?  And then we'll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public places.  Then in some private places.  Then we'll make it a crime ever to be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy cubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and after.  But, see, there's still a right to privacy.  We haven't curtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it'd be to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a VR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.  And hey, nobody'll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.  After all, if you're not doing anything illegal...  Funny, though.

I don't know how many folks noticed it, but Dorothy \\\"Trust Me\\\" Denning gave a real clue to the current state of the art at NSA on decrypto machines when she said the NSA told her they didn't even want to be the holder of any part of the key.    Now why is that?  I doubt there is a trapdoor in Skipjack.  (But we will never know).  And I doubt the NSA would promote a mass market chip they couldn't compromise.  Ergo, NSA is now capable of compromising (probably with brute force keysearch) engines of the complexity of Skipjack.  Look at the specs.  Why, I bet they have thousands of little chips chugging away in their crypto busters... Maybe even tens of thousands.  Complexity? Not much more than a 3090.

Mitchell hit close to .300 in Atlanta and  continued to walk alot after his promotion. He was then (I think) left off the playoff roster, and started the next year in the minors where even the Braves will tell you he underperformed because he was so mad at going back down.   he struggled last year, no doubt, but even the Braves blamed part of it on the demotion. I'd much rather have Mitchell than say Mark Whiten on the Cards.   \",\"   They are illegal here in Manitoba as well though I don't know what  methods are used to detect them.  It has always amazed me with the way the laws work.  It is not illegal to  sell them here in Manitoba, only to have them within a vehicle.  (Last I  heard, they don't have to be installed to be illegal.)\",\"  If people are going to do this, I really wish they would tell me first. I'd be happy to go over the insert (in the PDR) with them and explain everything.  All too many patients read the insert and panic and then on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug and we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably didn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit they wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or something.  What people don't understand about the inserts is that they report every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating that the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to happen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the AMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific. There are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking. Patients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks to themselves properly.  I'm sure Herman is going to \\\"go ballistic\\\", but so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been reported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will refuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for PDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need. I am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the domain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient. For common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help quite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the computer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly, physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have, as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked things that the patients should have found out from their physician but didn't.  Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either. Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They won't be as afraid to ask the system, we hope. --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\": While not exactly a service incident, I had a similar experience recently   : when I bought a new truck. : I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we   : agreed on a price.

The finance guy then    A similar thing happend to me a year ago.  I bought a used Ford Bronco (which has since been stolen...  :(  )  and few weeks after I paid and took delivery, they sent a letter telling me they goofed and  miscalculated the license renewal by $300 and that I need to send in a check to \\\"avoid further delay\\\" in the processing of my registration. The thing is, I had already received the pink slip from the DMV, so I ignored it.  I received another letter and then the phone calls started coming.  First from the finance guy and then from the general manager, both hounding me for the extra money.  They left me alone once I told them I already had the paperwork and pointed out the clause in the contract that stated that the final price was just that: FINAL. Afterall, they wouldn't budge if I had told them I wanted another $300 off after the deal had been signed, right?  I told them not  to call again and that I would not do business with them in the future. They didn't seem to have a problem with that.  This, after all, was a used Ford at a Toyota dealership.  I had a much better experience buying a new Pathfinder about a month ago.  It certainly pays to buy a car on the last Sunday of the month. It was even raining too, so they had done very little business that  weekend and were really willing to deal.  I kept telling them I would think about it, and they kept dropping the price.  Got a very good deal and so far have been very please with the service.\",\" The only difference is the time the driver gets loaded. mouse.sys will be loaded during the config.sys and therefor before the command.com. mouse.com will be loaded during autoexec.bat and so after the command.com.   mouse.com could be started from the commandline after the booting and it could - perhaps - be unloaded, if no other driver is loaded after it. The working of both drivers is totally the same.  When I ran dos, I preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat, because some programs won't run with some drivers and I could choose the ones I needed during startup. But with DRDOS6, this advantage is gone, because DRDOS lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded.  Michael\",\"Sixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100.  Finally, the 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up,  became warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I took a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride. They had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours before I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom -- surrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.  Today was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes, 50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat Touring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot. Some sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one MSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on the back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that Cycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like a big moto party.  After about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime, and another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/ pray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the parking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from  the Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else into the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the  ST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of the road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a bicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.  Well I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could  think was \\\"big\\\".  Then I put one foot up.  \\\"Heavy\\\" came to mind very quickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to  tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.  By 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even on bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that  did not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is on a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north of the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95 splits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access highway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton,  Manchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester. On its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about 30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many thoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.  Cindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along in top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane  changes were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this  thing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the fairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was non-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless. Smooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of, but it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless buzz.  The jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the brakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius, decreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.   The section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok in this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack oft featured in \\\"Spencer for Hire\\\" -- a place where you could really  find \\\"Spencer\\\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting through traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.  About half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal for \\\"hold on tight\\\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second gear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a  short shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light traffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new. Well, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort lane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went  until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed there.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering,  I looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.  Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \\\"get off in a mile\\\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted to re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were several manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the  slow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could  see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed to thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad out front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put the thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side stand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.   My demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable, hardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than  list, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.\",\"Configuration of IDE Harddisks       ==============================   last update: 14.4.1993  collected by Carsten Grammes (ph12hucg@rz.uni-sb.de) and published regularly on comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Another statement (maybe right): IDE harddisk don't have Precomp and LZone. The precomp is a built-in parameter and lzone isn't used because most if not every IDE disk has autopark.

I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master.    In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives  when performing diagnostics.    There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way  interface connector. They have the following functions and are described  in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper  described nearest the 40 way interface connector.  LK2: LED       When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the      interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An      external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with      the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will      be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130      Ohms ot 220 Ohms.  LK1: Dual Drives      This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single      bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,      indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.  LK4: Master      When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If      there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be      jumpered in this way.  LK5: IOChRdy      When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is       fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher      data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per      second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally       fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per      second.     There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s) may be jumpered:       Master, single drive with LED on interface  LK2 & LK4 fitted.

The particular need in this case is for three machines, each in a different office of the same building, each having access to a Windows-based accounting system.  My first thought is to set up MS Windows for Workgroups on each of the machines (likely a 486 and two 386's) along with the appropriate Ethernet cards and cabling that come with the Windows for Workgroups starter kit (one additional user kit will be necessary).  It then seems logical to purchase a simple multi-user accounting system, along the lines of DacEasy or M.Y.O.B., and fire it all up!  The 486 will more or less act as server with a report/check printer attached to it. Cable runs of 30-40 feet will be necessary for this setup.  Well, this all seems too easy to me.

Jagr did not have a better season than      Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of      hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty      plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.       Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice      time per game and some measure of its \\\"quality\\\" (i.e., is the player put out      in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up      against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would      much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious      merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.  Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/- comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way play.  In my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the other hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get 90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.  (By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy floater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like overtime of playoff games). \",\"This may be a simple question but:  We have a number of PC's which we use to link to a mainframe using  Novell LAN WorkPlace for DOS (via WIndows 3.1).

As a result of the spacecraft entering Contingency Mode on April 9, all payload instruments were automatically powered off by on-board fault protection software.  Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memory was successfully reloaded on Monday, April 19.  To prepare for Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight Sequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of Payload Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning beginning at 10:30 AM.  Over this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands to perform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data for analysis by the Navigation Team.  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator testing will take place on Monday .  The Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday, April 25, with activation at Midnight, Monday evening April 26.  C9 has been modified to include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due to Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrument calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument. This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements which occur during approach and mapping phases. MAG Cals will require the sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin state and perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data points in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations.\",\"Whenever I exit Windows, I can't use control-alt DEL to reboot my   computer, because the system hangs when I do this.

In the past, God gave us the ability to create life through sexual relations.  Now, he is giving us the ability to create life through in vitro fertilization.  The difference between the two is merely  cosmetic, and even if we gain the ability to create universes we won't begin to approach the glory of God.   The power we are being given is a test, and I am sure that in many cases we will use our new abilities unwisely.  But, people have been using sexuality unwisely for millenia and I haven't heard an outcry to abolish it yet!   No matter how far we extend our dominion over the physical world, we aren't impinging on God's power.

Anyway...)   The basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption of Mary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles  and all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were present when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days later, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was still unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There was no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed that Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their   preaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently  considered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the apostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of the assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.\",\" -> According to the TIFF 5.0 Specification, the TIFF \\\"version number\\\" -> (bytes 2-3) 42 has been chosen for its \\\"deep philosophical  -> significance\\\".  -> Last week, I read the Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy, and rotfl the -> second time.

P. A1.  NEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE   * INQUIRY: Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage    by a man who infiltrated political groups  By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.  SAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world, Roy Bullock was a small-time art dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District.  In reality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40 years.  His code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal, and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) in her Washington, D.C., office.  For a time, Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White Aryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes.  From police sources he obtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people.  And he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government to trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills.  These are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a former Los Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with police and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide intelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League.  Officials of the Anti-Defamation League, while denying any improper activity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation.  They have refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz.  Transcripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents released by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory.  At times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air with laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like \\\"Ironsides\\\" and \\\"Flipper.\\\"  On one occasion, Gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a pro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa, Israel.  Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any ties to Israel, Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him.  Shortly afterward, another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed him.  The court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard, a former CIA agent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League.  Gerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the FBI, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker.  Its contents included passports, driver's licenses and identification cards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for four American embassies in Central America; and a collection of blank birth certificates, Army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies.  Also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, a black hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos of blindfolded and chained men.  Investigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the ADL confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of one target group, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee.  Each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony, San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant.  The Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civil rights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. The ADL's fact-finding division, headed by Irwinn Suall in New York, enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists.   However, evidence seized from Bullock's computer shows he kept files on at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Earth Island Institute, the United Farm Workers, Jews for Jesus, Mother Jones magazine, the Center for Investigative Reporting, the Bo Gritz for President Committee, the Asian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP.  The computer files also included information on several members of Congress, including Pelosi, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey from the Bay Area.  In their statements, Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation League has collected information on political activists in the Los Angeles area for more than 30 years.  They said they worked closely with three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who specialized in intelligence work, a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism expert and a San Diego County Sheriff's Department intelligence officer.  A spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation, and the San Diego Sheriff's Department declined comment.  Bullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama.  Although he is not Jewish, he began working undercover as a volunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party.  Bullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by the ADL as an intelligence operative, he told authorities.  In the mid-1970s, he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the West Coast.  To keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneled through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has never missed a payment in more than 32 years, Bullock said.  \\\"I was an investigator for the ADL.  I investigated any and all anti-democratic movements,\\\" Bullock said.  \\\". . . Officially, I'm only a contract worker with Bruce Hochman.  That way, the league would not be officially connected with me.\\\"  Bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists to Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own name but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink.  \\\"I'm one of a kind,\\\" he told police.  In recent years, however, his ADL affiliation has increasingly become known, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him.  In the mid-1980s, he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police.  In part because of this investigation, he became close friends with Gerard, who at the time was working in the San Francisco police intelligence division.  Bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups.  An FBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group:  \\\"Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, and would share the reports with Gerard.  Bullock also gave the trash to Gerard for Gerard to examine.  Gerard would later return the trash to Bullock.\\\"  From a wide range of sources, Bullock compiled files on 9,876 individuals and more than 950 political groups.  Gerard, whose files contained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people.  In 1987, Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the South African government.  Bullock tells of meetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100 bills.  Bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources. Once he rewrote an innocuous item published by San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African Bishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli -- and submitted it as his own work.  Bullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence.  Bullock said he split about $16,000 from the South African government evenly with Gerard, telling him at one point, \\\"I may be gay but I'm a straight arrow.\\\"  In his interviews with the police and FBI, Bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law.  For example, Bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records and criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer.  And he said Gerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence files on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy.  Bullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation of Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League's San Francisco office.  Bullock seemed proud of his \\\"Operation Eavesdrop,\\\" in which he used a paid informant, code-named Scumbag, to help tap into a White Aryan Resistance phone message network, listening to the messages left by members of the right-wing group.  \\\"For a short time, it was wonderful,\\\" he told police.  In Los Angeles, ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a \\\"fact-finder\\\" to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups.  Among other things, he told San Francisco authorities, the Los Angeles ADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had \\\"anti-Israel leanings\\\" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such sentiment.  Gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he attempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a rival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies.  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival and threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hate group.  Gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the probe, providing considerable information about the ADL operation.  Unlike Bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the investigation.  Gurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewed by The Times. Bullock's attorney said his client would not comment.\",\"I am glad that you recognize that people should not engage in denial and repression, and should acknowledge such. The United States, with its people, have recognized that repression has taken place, with the loss and outright abrogation of civil liberties and constitutional protections of citizens. This recognition has taken the form of the civil rights law (let's just discuss the federal level for now), such as 18 USC 241 et. seq., 42 USC 1981 et. seq, et. al.    With this recognition of repression, at times manifested in the form of collective guilt, I want people to recognize denial.  Though it can be said that white people numerically commit more crimes in the United States, because white people are a majority, it can also be said that black people commit a disproportionate amount of crime in the United States, in their relation to their numbers in population.

Unless people account for their behavior, and for the behavior of their immediate community, nothing will improve.  Regards, \",\"I want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around 5 megabytes / sec for very large data transfers.  (Around 5 MB.)  I have a Quadra 950.  I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.          (using block-mode transfers) I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can          achieve 6.8 MB/s.  Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.  It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer, then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s result in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)  So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer,   Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer. Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer. Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.         ... Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer. Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card.  Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously, and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho') each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.  Why?  Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time.) Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use the same bus to mac RAM?  Is there anything I can do?\",\"Hi all,    I have a IIsi with a floppy drive that might be bad (and might just be out of alignment, I haven't checked yet. :-))  If the drive is not easily reparable, I'd like to replace it with an _internal_ floptical.

WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.   The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password   and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full   descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli   [BER91].    decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution.    There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,   Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will   decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox   files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you   think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a   call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files   that have a 10 char or less pw key.''  * How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?    A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the   plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.   If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the   following:     1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.   (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of   the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal.    If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something   over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different   key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes   of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which   indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.    2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This   removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since   English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of   text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing   plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact   one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)    If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a   standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis   texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in   the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.   See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].  * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]    Here's one popular method, using the des command:      cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail    Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called   PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through   1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.   There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this   writing.    There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting   mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own   newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ   as well.    PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm   without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)   in the USA.    RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which   is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside   the USA.    Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of   the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the   message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there   have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and   algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as   we know).  * Is the UNIX crypt command secure?    No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt   breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks   on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].  * How do I use compression with encryption?    A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by   some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).    Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact   distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's   impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse   characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up   more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy   has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some   redundancy in your compressed output.    Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they   have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that   actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of   UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''   that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.      This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a   bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means   removes the need for strong encryption.    Compression after encryption is silly.  * Is there an unbreakable cipher?    Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the   one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as   plaintext.    Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be   useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by   likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is   expected to remain valid.  * What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?    Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom   number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be   cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to   predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of   the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of   0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.    A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function   of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently   random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by   the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps   generated by a hardware random number source).    Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,   generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of   entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,   cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo    gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in   it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,   for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random   string.    When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is   important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that   because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \\\"random\\\".  For   example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be   unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a   clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.  * What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?    See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount   of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in   the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number   of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this   can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to   back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis.    Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have   multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security   from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.    Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic   measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives   probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext   for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible   plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys   are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally   deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine   the likelihood of events of interest.    Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than   D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not   enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of   possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,   which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to   8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but   the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work   required to find the key after approximately D characters have been   intercepted.    In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used   in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key   size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if   it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few   practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all   manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack   some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic   considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a   recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.   Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and   information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most   promising directions.    Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information   statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal   1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the   possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].  * What is key management and why is it important?    One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in   full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,   and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of   course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling   Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)   Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can   eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in   modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are   transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but   also enough key material to cover the traffic.    Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and   handling of keys.    A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology   is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use   employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key   Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that   certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control   personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and   to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the   reporting of lost CIKs.    This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management   problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,   many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''  * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?    Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from   relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a   linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random   number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds   and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a   high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically   this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for   cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more   complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---   but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable   structure at all.    See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].  * What is the correct frequency list for English letters?    There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than   the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:   namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of   English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,   but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.    The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do   you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a   fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It   has changed over time; it is different between different authors.   Any particular message will have different statistics from those of   the language as a whole.    The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have   exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all   reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.   In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other   buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood   estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a   text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with   reasonably robust answers.    So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will   be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.  * What is the Enigma?    ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of   information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by   the British during WWII.''    See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].  * How do I shuffle cards?    Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of   values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output   permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you   need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly   distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that   function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH   is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two   addresses given)    for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;    modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since   ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the   error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s   modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less   than y, go back and get another ranno() value.   * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?    Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with   possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted   separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps   even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.    As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard   PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the   keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be   encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in   part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one   of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.    If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must   be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in   the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.   The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the   illegal copy.   * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?

If his conscience forbade him to go to war in Vietnam, it should forbid him to perpetuate this system of government-sanctioned slavery.   If our government would pay attention to SERIOUS domestic issues (the ECONOMY) and choose to stay out of other people's wars (Iraq, Bosnia, Somalia), we would not be in this fix.  An anyway, couldn't the jobs be replaced by improving our domestic situation?

An On/Off Road Rally consists of the following:     1. An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of       directions and clues guiding participates around the        Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course       based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will       be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which       they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the       number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately        lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is        set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points       will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions       or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,       basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.     2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants       will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.       Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles       without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half       the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle       unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will       divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified       4x4s can run the course.         At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring   participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.   Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.  * This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles   so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be   street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section   of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper   from their vehicle :) .

These are described by the inventor as exploiting the second-order perturbations in a three body system.  The probe was launched into this region for the earth-moon-sun system, where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow down. The idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without expending fuel, we'll just find the trajectory that makes it possible\\\".

EDT                     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you  in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking  part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.              You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas  Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to  mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he  has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all  followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education  here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according  to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational  system.              His philosophy of government, his belief in the  importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest  here this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us  President Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in  the Chamber of Commerce studios.                Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for  taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite  network and we welcome you here this evening.              Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.   And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening  also.              I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure  many of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that  you'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In  Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.              I believe the President has a few words that he might  want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that  at this time.  It's great to have you.              THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.              I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob  Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the  Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making,  along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine  tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people  from school to the work place.              I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts,  recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this  economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to  work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to  make things happen.              This satellite town meeting is a good example of that  kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home  state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart  Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing  several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I  appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all  the rest of you.              I have tried as hard as I could to move toward  constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about  this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson  believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in  education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion,  freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and  third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.                If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this  beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful  cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change  with changing times.              For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit  and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we  can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight -- about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless  we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in  government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase  our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the  long run.              We also have to have people who can carry their load.   And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven  or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system  and continues into the work force where education must go on for a  lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can  learn.              And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing  we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership  between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the  private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're  trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that  would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many  thousands that have a strong education component so our young people  can be learning and working at the same time.              Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good  place we can begin, I think, the discussion.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.              Each month we get together and talk about ways that all  citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And  tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours  can prepare students for this world of work.              This week, the Education Department and the Labor  Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called  Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.   The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's  proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched  jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged  areas of the country.                Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it  somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls  for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your  words is that so important?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.   First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may  have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want  them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to  continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of  research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may  forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year  over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for  schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already  taught before.              Secondly, we want to help these young people progress,  not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to  abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is  learning because we think that the best and most productive workers  will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience  could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to  succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are  disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go  into the next year, is really even greater.                Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs  throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this  educational component of training.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr.  Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer  or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with  education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people,  for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning  geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or  working on something, and they can see the exact and direct  application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a  lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between  education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.   It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of  young people even beyond the summer.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.                Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship  program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell  us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it  developing.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why  it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade  will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will  require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people  get in a high school diploma.                If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries  of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school  education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young  people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not  go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because  they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their  employers.              So we think America has a big economic interest in  trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school  but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes  two years of further training either in a community college, a  vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in  this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some  funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states  and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in  a way that would be customized essentially by the business community,  based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could  revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and  the earnings of American workers.              SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think  you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the  people watching this program -- that the business community and  educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many  of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In  fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The  people watching this program probably are the ones who are most  directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley  and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes  already out there.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight  about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning   career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal  with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of  these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and  you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much  longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business  community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're  doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The  Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these  kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've  aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.              The business community is going to be actively engaged  in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and  helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions  develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.              Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is  one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these  players in a community come together and work together and cooperate  together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and  the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody  is talking, but they're not really working together in a common  strategy.              And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick,  would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic  excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a  tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to  make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be  eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year  college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're  talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation  skills for on-the-job learning.              And again, those are the critical components.  It's  already being done.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one  point based on my personal experience at home -- the business  community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are  the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught,  but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort  of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are  going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the  second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and  influence them.  So I think that's very important.              And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at  the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some  funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make  sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the  quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to  determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.              SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of  course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery  program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about  long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr.  President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the  communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be  coming forth before too long.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I  were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public  schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that  a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.                I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals  that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President  Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to  do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in  Congress that will actually define the things that the national  government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the  children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those  goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school  ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school  graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are  confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are  second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe,  disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took  them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of  life-long learning in this country.              And each one of those goals there's a national role, a  state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector  role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to  introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is;  and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job  is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality  that we need to meet.              It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite  like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.   Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their  money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and  partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really  it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms  of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to  support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform  efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.              Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to  the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of  course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and  I wonder if you would comment on that.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of  our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they  don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system  of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had  national skill standards to which they could aspire and which  employers would understand as a national credential, many of these  young people would actually find that they were much more eligible  for jobs.              Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other  countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to  college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain  technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If  you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to  develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working  with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private  industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the  kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other  institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go  ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce  Todd of Austin, Texas.              Q   Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and  Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We  have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who  have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me  simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with  much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are  very supportive.                We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our  summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to  have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much  as 3,500 with the federal assistance.                Much of the question that we had designed you have  answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But  the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day  would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round  is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal  level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year- round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the  local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's  something that we believe is very important to success in this  effort.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to  answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling,  and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.   I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.                First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can  structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer  program and that will move a lot of these young people back into  schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in  the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to  try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs  to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're  working on that.              Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the  Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to  build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job  training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give  heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you  asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we  hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being  trained on a year-round basis.              And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said  a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen  as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people  actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when  they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we  hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and  we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget  cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue  raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be  able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.              Bob, do you want to say anything?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out  of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing,  and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high  school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in  addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of  jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.   It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the  economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything  else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I  think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I  think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or  greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going  to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything  right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000  will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into  next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it  will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working  together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And  then the state, with all the various school districts, a very  important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I  think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that  moving.              The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.                Doctor?              Q   Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to  be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school  and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since  its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two  alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages  we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an  extremely effective learning strategy.              And over the years, we've come to believe that there are  several principles that are very important in bridging the school and  work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with  practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure  to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect  upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and  lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the  development of high performance competencies.                My question, then is:  How can the general education  faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with  transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies  can you suggest to achieve this integration?              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think --  and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting  work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next  guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists    in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to  them and we can discuss it later.              You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?              THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one  thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as  clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the  people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more  explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics  is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish  what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is  vocational learning and what is academic learning.              I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think  we should have a strong component for people who are in the  vocational program.              SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to  rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and  work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're  important for all students.  It's not just a special group of  students that needs them.              Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United  States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream  experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and  12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience  and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on  to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they  can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and  career directions.              But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often  goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work- related work within the classroom, within our schools.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's  going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I  think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank  you and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and  your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \",\"  If not for the lack of extraneously capitalized words, I'd swear that McElwaine had changed his name and moved to Cal Poly.

Blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration rate for violent crimes.  So I doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism present.  There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories.  Interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in the rest of the United States! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt blacks.  In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).  Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a situation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.  Blacks with similar histories (crime) to whites get the same sentences, except in the South, where they receive around 20% less on paper!!    --  There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of environmental disaster.

Chances are that many locksmiths have the code numbers for house locks they've installed, and in an emergency can cut keys; thus they'd also provide such keys to the government pursuant to a court order.

Space Science Dept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail proposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting. Here goes :      The Microlight Solar Sail    -------------------------  1. Introduction The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.  However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.  2.Design Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control methods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.  The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.  3.Missions The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example: a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit rate. b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base, BTW] c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged tube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an ideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300 deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating container.

-------- End of part 9 of 14 --------\",\"  Nonsense.  I quite clearly state that it was Greg that made the claim that Gainey never made an error.  And he made the claim. Read below.  From rec.sport.hockey Thu Apr 15 21:22:49 1993 From: gballent@hudson.UVic.CA (Greg  Ballentine) Message-ID: <1993Apr15.160450.27799@sol.UVic.CA>  [nonsense deleted]  Gainey is the best defensive forward ever.  I stand by that assessment. He was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame.  Did you ever watch him play? He never made a technical error.  [more nonsense deleted]   To knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious.  Your hockey education is not my responsibility.    He was just another player.  To laud him as anything more I find bothersome.  I hated the Habs.  I hated Lafleur until I realized that he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to ever  skate in my lifetime.  Why would anyone talk about Gainey?      Did he play hockey at a high level?  Was he any good?  If not, why would you bother to bring JC up?  I am talking about hockey players here.  If you can't follow the conversation don't follow up.  As I said previously, it is not my responsibility to educate you.   Sure.  Two journeymen.  Big deal.  Neither one of them is worth discussing.     That is an excellent idea and if I decide to waste any more time responding to any of your, or Greg's, postings then I will be sure to implement that very macro.    Tarasov claimed that Gainey was a \\\"hockey god.\\\"  And Greg ate it up. And that is what this thread is all about.  If you didn't know  that then why are you responding?  And as for \\\"blanket disregard for these individuals\\\", I can remember  Leaf teams, purely populated by such \\\"individuals\\\", winning four  Stanley Cups.  Teams.  No one ran around telling us that George Armstrong was the best hockey player in the world.   Right.  I had to get to the end of your posting before I realized you were  a complete joke.  In the future, if you are going to respond to my postings I would appreciate it if you could present a cogent argument supported by facts gleaned from a version of reality that most of the rest of us would recognize.  cordially, as always,   rm \",\"I just bought a select 300 and rushed home to print  some grayscale pictures for my kids, when I discovered that grayscale(and photograde) are not available if you are using an SE...even if you are running with an '030 cpu. You won't see this in the printer's docs, and the Apple rep didn't mention it to our users group either. It seems that SE ROMs won't support those \\\"features\\\". Okay, I  guess I should have somehow known that this was the case. Let the buyer beware, huh Apple?  Be that as it may, I have been thinking about the  problem and I'm puzzled. Why  can't a defencieny in the  ROM be made up for in software. I write software for a living (on unix platforms) and I don't understand the \\\"it just can't be done\\\" responses I've gotten from those I have asked so far.  Isn't Mode32, or somesuch piece of  soft- ware, just such a fix.   Anyway, I was hoping someone knowledgeable about Mac internals could set me straight: is it simply impossible for a mac SE to print grayscale, or could someone armed with enough info and a little pro- gramming experience cook something up that would supplement the ROM's capabilities?  Also, how does one know if one's mac can support the grayscale and photograde that the Select 300 is supposedly capable of? ( Short of buying the printer and trying it out like I did)  Thanks for your help.\",\" I'll throw in a vote for a Metzler \\\"economy\\\" tire, the ME77. Good for mid-size older bikes.

After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was  very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).  It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.  The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb. McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball. So on & so forth.  I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.  For myself, I think the fresh start of Magowan/Baker/etc has really wiped out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor in helping them significantly improve over last year.\",\"I am looking for information on infra red based position encoders.

Most people seem not able to, and that is why so many deny that this problem exists, for me most especially in the industrialised countries (low growth rates, but large environmental impact). Iran's high growth rate threatens things like accelerated desertification due to intensive agriculture, deforestation, and water table drop. Similar to what is going on in California (this year's rain won't save you in Stanford!). This is probably more to blame than  the current government's incompetence for dropping living standards in Iran.\",\"    You also have a severe problem with news headers.

(Of course these could all be wrong.....)   from                        THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                Dorothy Denning                            Revised, April 21, 1993  . . .  The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  . . .  ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.  Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,   which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed.  ------------------  suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip, but did not know F, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from if law enforcement field     E[E[K; U] + N; F] not knowing N would might make this much harder.  Now suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not), If I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know U for a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for the other party.  If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field, since I could make my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also allows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are saying but I could know who you are saying it too.  Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of messages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the key generation method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that matter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U's will be chosen from know weak keys for the system.  Obviously the compromise of F would be a disaster, both to law enforcement for whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that it is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot of people (more then 1) know what it is (and if some \\\"panel of experts\\\" is going to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forget grinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.

Some of what I  would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may  never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars  as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and  a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief  in an afterlife.    The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks  and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light  crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.   Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live  in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The  impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped  into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life  forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels  (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains  one weekend, \\\"getting away from it all\\\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing,  malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed  the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80  miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters  much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.   But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't  fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever -  like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch  commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer,  truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.   If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at  least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.    To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage  of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at  8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the  local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it  if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could  be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky  while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that  as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid,  even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. \",\"The U.S. Government's campaign of persecution and genocide against the Branch Davidians was a resounding success.

Features:     Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.    No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).    Generic clients.    Customizable servers.    Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).    Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).    Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily         attached.  Functionality:    Client:    The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things    when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's    viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's    actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to    other users.     The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to    develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that    resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting    it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.     This release of the client software supports the following functionality:      o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)      o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)      o User Interface Panels      o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for  faster frame rates)      o Mouse and Keyboard Input     (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the    PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because    I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)    Server(s):    This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is    provided in this release for potential world server developers:      o Transparent Client Management      o Client Message Handling     This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of accepting and    terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer    can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.     Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is    what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:      o Server Selectable Extension Installation:         What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended         functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension         initialisers you want.      o Event Handler Registration:         When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback         functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.         (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)      o Collision Detection Registration:         If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide         some basic information to the collision detection management software.         Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.      This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because     the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects     from which to choose.      The following is all you need to make a World Server application:      o Provide an initWorld function:         This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus         any initialization you want to do.      o Provide a positionObject function:         This is where you determine where to place a new client.      o Provide an installWorldObjects function:         This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.      o Provide a getWorldType function:         This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.      o Provide an animateWorld function:         This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects         move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit         (to avoid outrunning the clients).      That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the     three world servers I've provided:          generic - 81 lines         dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the                            stairs! Will probably be improved with future                            versions)         dogfight - 72 lines  Location:     This software is located at the following site:    ftp.u.washington.edu     Directory:    pub/virtual-worlds     File:    multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z  Futures:     Client:      o Texture mapping.      o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading      o HMD support.      o Etc, etc....     Server:      o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).      o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction      o Etc, etc....     Both:      o Improved Comms!!!

To cover my arse, what I'm trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong, as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism (I wish!).  Whereas I _logically_ can only support the weak atheist position, in effect I am a strong atheist (and wish I could be a mathematical one).  To justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is faulty.  If I read the FAQ correctly, no argument for the existence of god (generic, as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever been found to be unassailable.  To me this is adequate evidence that the _real_god_ is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight), which in turn I accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.  I'm a little fuzzy on the edges, though, so opinions are welcome (but perhaps we should change the thread subject).\",\" This is a classic example of excessive faith in reason.

Thanks much.  \",\"  I think we agree on much.  However the paragraphs above seem to repeat uncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of \\\"progress\\\" and \\\"rationality\\\" in science.  Since I've addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the not too distant past, I won't go into them again now.  What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhaps even the \\\"correct\\\") approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds.  It further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes \\\"forward\\\" (and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the \\\"critical function\\\" of science.  (Though why this critical function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery. If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true of the application of any \\\"critical function\\\" concerning replication. This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an \\\"anything goes\\\" view.)  True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is *not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science.\",\" Not true! Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality at any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason for your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font vendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being hand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.  TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting of diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the Windows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can be done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not just converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.   Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.    Hope this clears up some of the confusion.

Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than 7th  Al West - this division was the toughest for me to pick.  Whoever of the top           4 gets pitching should win it. 1.  Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success 2.  Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here.  Jose Canseco? 3.  Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching. 4.  Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close 5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here 6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs 7.  California Angels - will win no games  NL East 1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach! 2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga 3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected 4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a \\\"team\\\" 5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me 6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing 7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doing  NL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division. 1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern 2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all 3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 2 4.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 1993 5.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants 6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink 7.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL.   NLCS  Montreal d. Atlanta  (Braves fans, yes I'm probably contradicting                             what I said in my NL West comment.) ALCS  New York d. Minnesota  World Series  New York d. Montreal - Hating the Yankees will be                                      fashionable again  NL MVP:  Barry Bonds, or maybe McGriff NL Cy Young:  Jose Rijo AL MVP:  Frank Thomas will deserve it (again), but Fielder might win it AL Cy Young:  Roger Clemens (at least will deserve it (again))  -- \",\" The sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside of the orbit of Mercury.  The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observed perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to Newtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations and calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later improved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's system of equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit of Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was afoot with Mercury.  But alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rate it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly curved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915 and Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian  geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of it's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession of Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb's numbers rather than Leverrier's.)  Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and that's fine.  But subsequent efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar have been fruitless.  -Bill Gawne   \\\"Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe   are the laws of the universe.\\\"                       - G. J. Caesar\",\"Hello all!  For few past days I've been fighting to get My NEC Multisync 3D (predecessor of 3FG) to work properly with the internal video of Mac IIvi.  With a VGA-adapter (as described in Dale Adams' posting about Quadra video) it works, only some minor interferences occur, small enough not to prevent any action on screen to be visible & clear.  But because the scanrates & stuff of 3D are well enough for emulating Apple 13\\\" RGB, I first made an adapter, then got one fron the local distributor of NEC. With both adapters I can get a picure, which looks excellent most of the time or every now and then. But with radical changes on screen (opening palettes, large windows etc.) there are major interferences in sync. The picture either tilts sideways or scrables up totally. Even when it is clear, there are some \\\"spiky\\\" interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing pull-downs etc. With the self-made adapter, almost identical to the VGA one, only sense pins differ, it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a picture clear enough to shut down from menu... With the adapter from NEC, everything is well most of the time, but sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely lost. But not nearly as often as with the self-made one.  I know, with self made adapters there can always be interference, but with the one provided by NEC... where's the source of this interference?  I'll give you the pinouts of the whole mess, and I hope that you can, at least someone (please try =) figure out what could be the best pin assignment for NEC 3D. I am going to make a completely new cable with maximum shieldings and isolations, as soon as someone figures out how the pins should be arranged, especially syncs and groundings.  Yes, I have checked that the monitor is not defective, it works perfectly well with all PC graphic adapters up to 1024x768 pixels and also Atari 71Hz monochrome, which I am using now with it.

And thanks! \",\" As I heard the story, before Albert came up the the theory o'relativity and warped space, nobody could account for Mercury's orbit.  It ran a little fast (I think) for simple Newtonian physics.  With the success in finding Neptune to explain the odd movments of Uranus, it was postulated that there might be another inner planet to explain Mercury's orbit.    It's unlikely anything bigger than an asteroid is closer to the sun than Mercury.  I'm sure we would have spotted it by now. Perhaps some professionals can confirm that. \",\" Rather, people kill people with guns.  The sad truth is: sometimes that is good, or at least, better than the alternative.   Ok.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the number has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these accidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.  ...  In fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that.  The idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber handgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense, would, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't why I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it, and might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to kill people.   In fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses of firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer not to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what you say when you point a gun at them.  If you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to immediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work the best.[3]   Certainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing) aren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of them were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with having deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to use deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right, but my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and knowing how to use the tools to do that.  \\\"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\\\"  - T. Jefferson.  I think what Jefferson said is still true.   Not very often compared to other use.[3]   This isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is very rare that a non-violent person will suddenly \\\"get-pissed\\\" and kill someone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long histories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these people wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it.   Right, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I never have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from rodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than is necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them to drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that, I don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and ammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm after, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point, people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns, particularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.

Michigan Avenue, Chicago IL  606111  (800) 621-7619   [2] RKBA.002 - Declining trend of accidental deaths by firearms            Version 1.1 (last changed on 90/04/23 at 22:28:19)  DESCRIPTION =========== The accidental deaths by firearm per capita has been declining steadily  for almost sixty years. In 1932, the accidental deaths by firearm per  1,000,000 people was 24.03. In 1987, it was 5.74. The decline has been  steady, consistent, and a fairly straight line when plotted. At the rate  of the last sixty years, it will reach zero sometime around 2025 AD.  CONCLUSION ========== Firearms have been a declining factor in accidental deaths for over  sixty years, despite rising per-capita gun ownership.    [1] = Year. [2] = Population. [3] = Accidental deaths. [4] = Accidental deaths per 1,000,000.
