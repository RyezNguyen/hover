So, rather than be something secular, it is something  SHK> very sacred.  I would go further, and say that much of the damage to the environment has been caused by the secular worldview, or by the humanist worldview, and especially by the secular humanist worldview.  This is not to say that ALL secular humanists are necessarily avid destroyers of the environment, and I am sure that there are many who are concerned about the environment. But at the time of the Renaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre, or the focus of culture (hence \\\"humanism\\\"). This consciousness was also secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the present age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at the same time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy. This doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it began to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European society and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its later stages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that justified  them.  There was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of \\\"economics\\\" - from the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces and powers. There were denominational differences among the new worshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was \\\"the free rein of the market mechanism\\\", while for others it was \\\"the dialectical forces of history\\\". But in both the capitalist West and the socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of Mammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who were concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to oppose what was happening and state their case.  Steve\",\"   [More stuff deleted]  This seems to be a pretty arogant definition of belief.  My beliefs are those things which I find to be true based on my experience of the world.  This experience includes study of things that I may not have experienced directly.  But even then, I can only understand the studies to the extent to which I can relate what I study back to what I have experienced.  Which means that by beliefs about God are directly related to my experience of God.  Having experienced God, I try to make sense of that experience.  I study religion and read the Bible.  I find things that echo what I have already experienced.  Out of this I build my beliefs.  I also find things that don't match my experience.  That doesn't make them false.  They just don't match my experience.  Maybe I will understand that stuff later.  I don't know.  Maybe all of my beliefs are wrong.  I can change my beliefs.  If someone else has beliefs that are different from mine, so what. Neither of us are necessarily wrong.  Someone else is making sense out of a different set of experiences.  Even though we have different explanations and beliefs, if we talk we might even discover that the underlying experiences are similar.  Some people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in one form, and usually has a single revelation.  The more dogmatic and inflexible the belief system, the more arrogant it will appear to an outsider.  There is another approach possible, however.  God is a mystery.  I am trying to solve the mystery, so I look at the evidence available to me.  I try to arrive at the best understanding that I can based on the evidence.  New evidence may cause me to change my understanding.  When I encounter someone with a different belief than my own, it isn't a threat, it is an opportunity to perhaps discover something new about this mystery I can never fully comprehend.

Typical posting:  Why have a newsgroup about atheism?  Why do atheists organize in groups?   What is there to discuss?  Response:  Many things are discussed here, including:  * Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's   family * Prayer in schools * Discrimination against atheists * Sunday trading laws * The Satanic Child Abuse myth * Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet' * How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students * How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers * Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual * Why people become atheists  Of course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians looking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't  want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure  from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.  ------------------------------  Subject: Hitler was an atheist!  Typical posting:  Hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!  Response:  Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:     The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in    his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_    superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_    not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]     For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their    abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the    Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be    active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every    man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who    in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his    religious community and tries to butt into the other.     [...]     Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will    of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_    fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]            -- Adolf Hitler, from \\\"Mein Kampf\\\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.  Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed  to believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist,  though.  ------------------------------  Subject: The Bible proves it  Typical posting:  In the Bible it says that...  Response:  Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable accuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed 'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The Bible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted.  Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to \\\"interpretation\\\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and one thing only is not legitimate.  Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.  It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: Pascal's Wager  Typical posting:  If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing -- but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.  Response:  This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.  Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often described as the \\\"avoiding the wrong hell\\\" problem.  If a person is a follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.  Secondly, the statement that \\\"If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing\\\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness. Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer.  Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that  the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of  comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God  is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.  Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on  evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or  cost-benefit analysis.  Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:    1. One does not know whether God exists.   2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does      exist.   3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.   4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.  There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at no \\\"cost\\\".  The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The argument thus collapses to \\\"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests to believe in God\\\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal intended the argument to be viewed.  The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him.  ------------------------------  Subject: What is Occam's Razor?  Typical posting:  People keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?  Response:  William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's  Razor.  In its original form, it said \\\"Do not multiply entities  unnecessarily.\\\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity, then do so.  Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it  more generally, for example as \\\"Take the simplest solution\\\".  The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations  for what we see around us:  1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which came into being as a result of natural processes.  2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and  there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be  of non-zero complexity.  Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest  that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one. Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:  3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.   We just imagine that there is.  This third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people  find unacceptable.   ------------------------------  Subject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus  Typical posting:  I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.  Response:  Preaching is not appreciated.  Feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that are on a \\\"conversion\\\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup talk.religion.misc).  You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would have them do unto you!  Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy analogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the basic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it, since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why I know that God exists  Typical posting:  I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.  Response:  Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist.  That evidence varies from person to person.  Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been abducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.  ------------------------------  Subject: Einstein and \\\"God does not play dice\\\"  Typical posting:  Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?  Response:  Einstein did once comment that \\\"God does not play dice [with the universe]\\\".  This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the Christian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore, Einstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.  A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following: \\\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.\\\"  Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an objective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that QM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found, and much evidence suggests that it never will be.  A longer quote from Einstein appears in \\\"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A Symposium\\\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In    \\\"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events    the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side    of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him    neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an    independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a    personal God interfering with natural events could never be    *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this    doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific    knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.     But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives    of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine    which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,    will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm    to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers    of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal    God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past    placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they    will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable    of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity    itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably    more worthy task...\\\"     \\\"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,    a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a    personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.    If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the    unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our    science can reveal it.\\\"  The latter quote is from \\\"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\\\", edited by Helen  Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.   Also from the same book:    \\\"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics    to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind     it.\\\"  Of course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does  not in itself imply that Christianity is false.  ------------------------------  Subject: Everyone worships something  Typical posting:  Everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.  Response:  If that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for example) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why there must be a causeless cause  Typical posting:  Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so chains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.  Response:  The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has no smallest member.  Further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed  Typical posting:  The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you don't think all this appeared here just by chance?  Response:  This is known as the Argument From Design.  It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk.origins for a while.  There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here. However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence, observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth.  The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some  external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately.  But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist position.  This leads us to the familiar theme of \\\"If a creator created the universe, what created the creator?\\\", but with the addition of spiralling  improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just \\\"is\\\" (or \\\"was\\\").  From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just \\\"is\\\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book \\\"A Brief History of Time\\\", explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.  The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called  Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it evolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the  watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the  universe too must have a creator.  The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above  those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates  watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have  created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are  clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.  Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in  the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear  reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument  would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a  different part of creation.  Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that  the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore  stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the  argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not  random, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus  internally inconsistent.  ------------------------------  Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true  Typical posting:  The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence.  For example...  Response:  The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence.  Early versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or James; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but that this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \\\"reconstructions\\\" of the original text have been published to this effect.  Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320 C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material.  Aside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is more well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently Asked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.  ------------------------------  Subject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem  Typical posting:  Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the Bible to be both true and complete.  Response:  Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal  system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary  arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be  valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically speaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal  system.)  Essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \\\"Liar  Paradox.\\\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \\\"This  sentence is false.\\\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal  system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.  The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.  One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom.  This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.  It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists within the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.  Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.  Another frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be both consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal systems, so such claims are nonsense.  ------------------------------  Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism  Typical posting:  Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?  Response:  The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I. Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman is a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the presidential primary:   RS: \\\"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in       God is important to me.\\\"   RS: \\\"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of       Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,       nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under       God.\\\"   RS: \\\"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation       of state and church?\\\"   GB: \\\"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not       very high on atheists.\\\"  UPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks.  The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27, 1989.  It can also be found in \\\"Free Enquiry\\\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue, Volume 8, Number 4, page 16.  On October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane, cochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a lawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School District 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \\\"one nation under God\\\" (Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:    RS: \\\"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.       Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\\\"    EM: \\\"It's bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"What is bullshit?\\\"    EM: \\\"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush       campaign is on this issue.\\\"   EM: \\\"You're welcome.\\\"  After Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract his statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the President, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by    \\\"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports    atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or    supported by the government.\\\"  For further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American Atheist Press's Cameron Road address.  ------------------------------  Subject: I know where hell is!  Typical posting:  I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!  Response:  There are several towns called \\\"Hell\\\" in various countries around the world, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now  getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.  ------------------------------  Subject: Biblical contradictions wanted  Typical posting:  Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?  Response:   American Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical contradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for details.  There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the archive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the United States be considered a Christian nation?  Response:  Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear that they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some quotes; there are many more.    \\\"What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?    In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the    ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen    upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been    the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert    the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient    auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,    needs them not.\\\"       - James Madison, \\\"A Memorial and Remonstrance\\\", 1785    \\\"I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of    the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.

Response:  No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):     Article 11     As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense    founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of    enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as    the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility    against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no    pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption    of the harmony existing between the two countries.  The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections such as Charles Bevans' \\\"Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776-1949\\\", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).  The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on June 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.  The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul General at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of Christianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there is no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.  In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation. \",\"I have an addition to the FAQ regarding \\\"why are there no atheist hospitals.\\\"  If I recall correctly, Johns Hopkins was built to provide medical services without the \\\"backing\\\" of a religious group...thus making it a hospital \\\"dedicated to the glory of [weak] atheism.\\\"  Might someone check up on this? \",\"We are developing an MS-Windows based product that uses a full screen window to display ~24 rows of textual data.

Just keep an eye out for the blue GLH Turbo that  utilizes the \\\"hit-the-ground-running\\\" merging technique.  At least I don't have a dog that you need worry about.  Last week while entering a sand/gravel covered intersection in the country,  I caught something unkosher out of the corner of my eye (you know that  disgusting sensation when great, as-of-yet unidentified, evil is about to  intimately acquaint itself with you-- kind of like knowing that that darkening  shadow around you just cannot possibly be anything even remotely good, because it probably has something to do with a Boeing 747 behaving, gravitationally speaking, much like a brick).  Negotiating my way into this intersection that  somehow reminded me of Daytona beach (sans H2O, sun, & babes) I manage to get a glance at my impending destiny.  Lucifer's own DOG.  Hell's secret blend of canine-- Doberman and Rottweiler (it moved with the grace of a Doberman, yet had the hulk and jowels of the Rottweiler-- a creature with a definite *wrong* end to be at).  The picture in my mirrors was fuzzy, but there was no  mistaking the fangs and saliva trail.   To shorten a verbose tale, my burly gaurdian-angels once again performed above and beyond the call of duty, carried the bike through the sand-trap (I honestlyhave no idea how), and left the minion of Beelzebub with a face that  suspiciously resembles a Metzler tread.  No blood, though-- Rats.

The scenario:   1 - Ordered a DX2/50 w/ Ultrastor 34F Local Bus HD controller  2 - Receive system 10 days after ordering (Happy)  3 - Discover Ultrastor 14F ISA HD Controller inside (unhappy)  4 - Call Gateway, receive the correct controller in 5 days    (getting happier)  5 - New controller doesn't work (unhappy again)  6 - Call Gateway again, get another controller in 5 more days    (cooling off, the end is in sight)  7 - This controller doesn't work either, motherboard is bad   (VERY unhappy)  Gateway's solution:  They will order me a new motherboard (5 more days)  and have on-site service install it for me. BUT, I have to take a day off of work because the service people only work 9-5 M-f.  I say, no way I've already blown about 20 hours with this, about 10 of them on hold and I don't have the time or $$ to take a day off work.  Also, my 30 day return period is almost over and I've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes.  So, the whole  thing is going back.     I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told me that I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system, but also the two hard drive controllers they had sent me.  Fortunately, I just spoke to customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything up gratis. The only downside is that now I have to order another computer.  I would really like to try Gateway again, I'm just very turned off by the prospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support again...  I think their products are great for the most part, but I'm beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation. Are other mail order companies as difficult to contact?

Notes ======== (Excerpted from the FAQ article)  Please do *not* post or mail messages saying \\\"I can't FTP, could someone mail this to me?\\\"  There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message.  There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message to an automated server saying something like \\\"send comp.sources.unix/fbm\\\", and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.  ==========================================================================  3.

Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes ===========================================  Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help. Don't overuse mail servers.  There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these mail servers have a command like    path a_valid_return_e-mail_address to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.  DEC's FTPMAIL -------------   Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,   and having a line containing the word 'help'.   You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you   must follow in order to get the files you want.    Note that the \\\"reply\\\" or \\\"answer\\\" command in your mailer will not work   for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send   requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.   Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com   address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not   responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.  BITFTP ------   For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.   Send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info.  Lightwave 3D mail based file-server -----------------------------------   A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images   and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.   The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list   and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for   several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.    The server resides on a BBS called \\\"The Graphics BBS\\\".  The BBS is   operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1   908/469-0049.  It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144   V.32bis/V.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps.    If you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server,   please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address:   server@bobsbox.rent.com.    For information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message   to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in   the body of the message:     HELP     /DIR   And a help file describing how to use the server and a complete   directory listing will be sent to you via mail.  [ Now it includes the Cyberware head and shouders in TTDDD format! Check it  out, only if you can't use FTP! -- nfotis ]  INRIA-GRAPHLIB --------------   Pierre Jancene and Sabine Coquillart launched the inria-graphlib mail   server a few months ago.      echo help | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr    will give you a quick summary of what inria-graphlib contains and    how to browse among its files.      echo send contents | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr    will return the extended summary.

Scene description languages ==============================  NFF ---   Neutral file format , by Eric Haines. Very simple, there are some   procedural database generators in the SPD package, and many objects   floating in various FTP sites. There's also a previewer written in   HP Starbase from E.Haines. Also there's one written in VOGLE, so you can   use any of the devices VOGLE can output on.   (Check in sites carrying VOGLE, like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)  OFF ---   Object file format, from DEC's Randy Rost (rost@kpc.com). [ The object archive server seems to be mothballed. In a future version,  I'll remove the ref. to it -- nfotis ]    Available also through their mail server. To obtain help about using this   service, send a message with a \\\"Subject:\\\" line containing only the word   \\\"help\\\" and a null message body to: object-archive-server@decwrl.dec.com.   [For FTP places to get it, see in the relevant place]. There's an OFF   previewer for SGI 4D machines, called off-preview in   godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au . There are previewers for xview and sunview,   also on gondwana.  TDDD ---- It's a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF, Rayshade, Imagine or vort objects. Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):    New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley   (worley@cup.portal.com)    I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format   called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,   from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely   distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.    In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file   with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the   objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially   on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various   object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,   Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables   for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views   in Postscript.  P3D ---   From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight   extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp   interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to   have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.    The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon   Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D   without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.    The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:   Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,   Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from   VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.    The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines   ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory   pub/graphics/programs/p3d.

Dec. 1989  Leading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua, launched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth Council meeting in North London, last week.  The diaspora, he claimed, \\\"was the cancer connected to the main tissue of the Jewish people\\\". He was scathing about its failure to act before the Holocaust.  He said the diaspora's religious and secular leadership had ignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposed Zionism. Consequently, he considered the Holocaust, \\\"the failure of Judaism\\\".  His talk, entitled \\\"Diaspora: A Neurotic Solution\\\", covered 5,000 years of Jewish history.  Mr. Yehoshua's other targets included Soviet Jews who were, he said \\\"not staying [in Israel], but running [away]\\\", and all Jews outside Israel \\\"who were using other people's countries like hotels\\\".  The only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was immoral, because it looked to Israel for its identity but lived elsewhere.  Worse, it threatened Israel itself, creating a distraction for her citizens, who were leaving by the thousands.  Mr. Yehoshua, who described himself as \\\"a soldier for aliyah\\\", ended by calling for the creation of a new \\\"total Jew\\\", living in Israel.  Earlier, speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on the difficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature, Mr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by the country's political situation.  He said Israel's wars had once provided writers with a vital source of inspiration.  Today, Israeli writers avoided writing directly about the Arab-Israeli conflict. No major work had been produced about the intifada.  Instead, writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity, emigration from Israel and personal and family issues.  Mr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the Israeli political situation. He could no longer step into an Israeli Arab's shoes and portray him as a real \\\"flesh and blood character\\\".  He claimed that after 40 years of statehood, the problem of Israeli identity had not been solved. He said Jews remained too pre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew, and were not concerned with the nature of that identity.  Jewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life, unlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for the country they lived in, he said.  He warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewish people, would have to struggle for its future, especially in literary circles. It faced fierce competition from the English language. \",\"ITEMS FOR SALE    1. Howard Miller Clock. It chimes like a grandfather clock. $250  2. Painting- A Tiger in the snow.

It is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normal civlized life. They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967 without civil and political rights.   It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country, Palestine. Gaza is not a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreign country for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians are concerned and as far as common sense has it.   It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens and the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists will begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same rights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.  Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel is entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should be entitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel to enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master and slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.  To close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistence and means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a crime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss  to which Israeli society has degraded.   I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain why Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return and live there ? Would they be allowed to, if they converted to Judaism ? Is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their religion or ethnic origin ? Please give an honest answer.\",\"Another issue of importance.  Was the crucification the will of God or a tragic mistake.  I believe it was a tragic mistake.  God's will can never be accomplished through the disbelief of man.  Jesus came to this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He desperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah.  If the crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this cup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men and women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes. Is Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucification was NOT the will of GOD.  God's will was that the Jewish people accept Jesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on the earth with Jesus as it's head. (Just like the Jewish people expected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what kind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very different world.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.  Men and women of that age could have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was on the earth.  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would have continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to live with GOD.  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to wait for Christ's return.  But when he returns will he be recognized and will he find faith on this earth.  Isn't it about time for his return.  It's been almost 2000 years.  Mike    And the two simplest refutations are these:  (1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament. I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded \\\"impact\\\" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event.  (2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.\",\"   Oh, lighten up.

An atheist is one for whom all things can : be understood as processes of nature - exclusively.  This definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However, I (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or spiritual explanations.   It makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood as natural processes, and to claim that our observations do not require us to postulate any divine intervention, or anything spiritual, for that matter. Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science. However, science has one advantage theology doesn't: it is self- correcting, with nature as its judge.   It is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self- consistent, simple picture of our universe. Science is no longer a bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics to psychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safe from its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness.   There is no need : for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is : no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by : physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is : determnined.  Actually, determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question, and science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow superdeterministic or not. I think the question does not have any meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparent free will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from their perspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free will or not?   : This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all : its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it : acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident.  Maybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - when during the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control one third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of  numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates and preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the same principle - only the systems that can start replicating will survive, those which don't don't make it. (Recommended reading: t.o)  : For an atheist, no : event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less : value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about- : an event can have value.   From whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, from my perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not have a perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective perspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and if I think about what it would it be like in their position, I will eventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily a gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution. Perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity is helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect others who seem to have identity, too.   Bill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.) for starters.  : How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing : the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On : what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It : seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you : have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what : in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to : establish your values.  C.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why he abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument is severely flawed.  Some values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Some others, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably its roots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved better and better in building and using tools, they also became better at killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could only favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one's own people.  The Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews was not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people together, under one god. Their god did not care much about people of other nations.   At the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jews were under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignore the Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and along with it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)  : Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what : difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or : otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only : way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the : objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it : - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer : that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries : no weight in any \\\"absolute\\\" sense.  It looks like you haven't bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there is an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may  value its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result of some physical event), and other's happiness, too, if the observer comes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is, without any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose their meaning.   It is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of view. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_  personal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truths do not exist.   The fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others is a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence by becoming social beings who can think and value others' existence.  Morality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins and many other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have sometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed.   : That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God : or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your : nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled : with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your : objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been : conditioned; there is no \\\"truth\\\" content. The whole of your : intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.  The last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there is every reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very well, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism is still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.  You are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective point of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view, _which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being, has its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point of view is a result of some physical events or not, it does not cease to be subjective.   From a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neither does pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are  inherently subjective.   Once again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us if we don't, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come from any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than to make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If god gave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not my fault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the point of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one's own and then to get mad at this.   God must be schizophrenic.  : All of this being so, you have excluded : yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil, : etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no : weight whatsoever.  Neither can the opinion of any god, for that matter. I cannot understand why a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way less credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.  Bill, take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being, _including_ gods. If god has a subjective viewpoint, it is his own point of view, and his morals are his own.   Petri \",\"   :  How about Kirlian imaging ? I believe the FAQ for sci.skeptics (sp?) :  has a nice write-up on this.

Publishing your results could be a bit of a problem, though.\",\" Windows NT or WNT can also be derived by the next letter in the alphabet of VMS - same as HAL and IBM. You might recall that the chief architect of VMS is also chief designer of WNT.  Rajiev Gupta \",\" Hey, it's better than the status quo.  I am far less worried about \\\"the feds\\\" tapping my phone than high school  scanner surfers who get their kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and  cordless phone calls.  It would be stupid to rely on even a \\\"Clipperized\\\" channel for truly  sensitive material, but it *does* seem to finally offer a reasonable way to  guard against casual eavesdropping.  For example, even with my strong \\\"right  to bear arms\\\" view of the private right to possess and use strong  cryptosystems, the system as described provides enough security that I would  actually buy a cordless phone, and would be much less wary of using cellular  phones, walkie-talkies, and so on.  As long as it's only used for mass-market  voice scrambling, I actually don't see a problem with it.  If you want more security than it offers, use something different.  Use PKCS  for electronic mail, CELP over DES or triple DES with Diffie-Hellman key  exchange for your voice traffic, or whatever.  And yes, I'd rather just see all crypto restrictions lifted, but this is at  least an incrememental improvement for certain applications... \",\"---------- cut here ---------- part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

This could be invalidated by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream and the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key generator synchronized between endpoints.  The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission interception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there's supposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps to the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants an encryption chip with a real time clock?  *****************************************************************************  The entire idea of the law enforcement block can be invalidated.  I just had the thought, that you could capture your own law enforcement blocks for session keys K that you will not use in actual transmissions as the session key authenticators.  The proviso that you don't mind your own serial number being discovered.  d. denning just sent out further information of a new version of the clipper chip. If a hash function were to be embedded in a clipper M transmission block reflecting the law enforcement block, it better not fall on 64 bit block boundaries.  If it were a recognizeable datum, you could lie with it too.  I like the randomizer inclusion in the MYK-80.

I agree completely. One thing I can't stand about the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is down!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around, etc.  But for most work, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than using the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do something simple if you are an inexperienced user, but how long is it before your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs at the moment.)  I don't think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in less time IF you are experienced.

With the Government of x-Soviet Armenia, we would sit down, go over all our outstanding issues, whether it's land or reparations or recognition, whatever it is. We'd like to sit down and ask for it. By all means, lands and properties were taken away from us and they should be returned to the rightful owners, the Turkish and Kurdish  people, who were there 3,000 years, long before the Armenians ever showed up in that area. Entire population of the region was subjected  to genocide beyond belief; genocide which was planned to exterminate  the whole Turkish people of the region to the last man, woman and child.  Armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians. To  assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings  was one of their methods.

I'm looking for applications where they were used. \",\" After IBM had invented the DES and the NBS had advertised for proposals, but before IBM had decided to respond, I argued strenuously that they  should not; they should keep it proprietary.   The biggest proponent of proposing was Dr. Lewis Branscomb.  Dr. Branscomb was the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS.  Fortunately for all of us, Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above question much better than I.  He realized how difficult it would be to gain acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism.  Because of the necessary complexity, publicity would not be sufficient and neither would  authority.  In fact, it has taken both of those plus more than 15  years.  We have also had independence.  The DES was solicited by NBS, invented and proposed by IBM, and vetted by NBS.  It has also been examined and vetted by experts like Adi Shamir, who are not subject to influence by any of these.  Even now, there are still people posting on this list who do not trust the DES in spite of all the time, all of the analysis, and all of the public scrutiny.  (Of course, it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to  gain acceptance for a novel mechanism, developed in secret, on the basis of authority alone.)  We had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can \\\"break\\\" the DES.  That is a silly question.  At some cost and in some time they can \\\"break\\\" anything.  The important question is at what cost and in what time.  The fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so important as what we know about their strength.  As long as we understand the cost and duration for an attacker, then we can use them in a safe way. At this point, we may never replace either because of the inability of any successor to overcome this knowledge gap.  DES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the century and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography. We are damned lucky to have them.\",\" The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.  Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple (early March).  Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is it because too many people take French and German in college to make the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance. Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.   For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.  Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.   Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care.  At that point, they wouldn't even consider a \\\"voucher\\\" approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.   It is \\\"free\\\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for that is part of their brainwashing agenda.  The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer  1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For  1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance. Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.   Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.  When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's public health insurance plan.  gld\",\"I have a 486DX 25mhz with local bus.

Some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they  were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for \\\"numbers\\\" (though  secretly afraid of them). Others steered clear of such puzzle books because  they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern  mathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't  know how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were  no exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a  specialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \\\"I willingly confess that  any time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was a hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of  my friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route --constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid  using algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it's a fact that is  well known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates,  nor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers (nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It  seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade  teachers.\\\"  Now, I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the  bookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to  recommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most  fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a  relatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to Venus and back.     One for the \\\"road\\\"   They both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley   glanced at the Royal Astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with   a group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. \\\"God   knows what this kind of stuff leads to,\\\" thought Kingsley.   The Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley's book and saw the History   of Herodotus. \\\"Good Lord, next he'll be reading Thucydides,\\\" thought   the Royal Astronomer.      --Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud  The book I'm talking about isn't very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24  elegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same time, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these  problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian  architecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is  now Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant  letters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of  Komitas, or the paintings of Saryan.  An edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a  bibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions of Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh  Century (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).  The abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way  of life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and  worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years  the book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in  Armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just anyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk  Father Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has  brought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the  general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable  problem book.    Vardapet Anania of Shirak   Once fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no   philosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering   it the mother of all wisdom.      --Anania of Shirak  Among ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because  of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his  work. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and Solutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation of scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and Armenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last work was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia,  Movses of Khoren).  In his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:   I, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our  Armenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately,   in the expression of the psalmist, \\\"every day I illuminated the   eyes of my mind.\\\" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,  I came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy,   the mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia   neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the   sciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man   named Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me  that in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,  Christosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But          soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but          only of certain fragmentary facts.   I then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me:   \\\"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the   coast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full   of wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature.\\\" I asked   them how they knew this. They answered: \\\"We saw ourselves that many   people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man.   Indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,  Philagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become   pupils of Tyukhik.\\\" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to   God, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.   I went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I   He sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St.   Gregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself   lived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there.\\\"   Vardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with   me. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated   the science of number, and with such success that my fellow students  at the king's court began to envy me.   I spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not   been translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable   collection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan,   books on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why   enumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did   not have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating  that when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into   Armenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the   translation read as if the work were written in that language   originally.   Tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had   learned the Armenian language. \\\"When I was young,\\\" he said, \\\"I lived   in Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and   for a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I   served as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and   literature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was   wounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to   the Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: \\\"If You prolong my life,   I shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to   collecting treasures of knowledge.\\\" And the Lord heard my prayers.   After I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria   and Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher   from Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned   to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\\\"   After some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for   him, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to   assume the teacher's position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to   God not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because  of his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study   with him.   And I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from   him this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our   country, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God's   help, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me   for my efforts.      Problems and Solutions   A half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed  on verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper;   one forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and   forty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many   copies were printed in all.      --Imitation of Anania of Shirak  A Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\\\"books have their own fate\\\"). The fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The manuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because, according to  Armenian historians, \\\"in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded  from invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children.\\\" Biding their time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of  ancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts). And its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two  manuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction  and commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited,  annotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a  member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).  In the translator's words, the problems of Anania are \\\"amusing, full of life,  and simple.\\\" Orbeli goes on to say: \\\"The subjects of the problems are  generally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland  Shirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are  named, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a  contemporary of Anania.\\\" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used  only \\\"aliquots\\\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is necessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to  represent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).  Like any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the  retelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their  full glory. So let's open Anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages.  Problems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D.  572.  Problem 1  My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the  Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary  heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops.  The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time,  pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third  time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were  still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from  this remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.  Problem 8  During the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak Kamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the Persian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a  day. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent  riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in  a day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.  Problem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian  translation, they are all called \\\"dishes.\\\" But in the original Armenian,  according to Orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are  called mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian  word, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before  Anania's Problems and Solutions.  Problem 18  There was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the  metal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from one fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten  drams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.  Several of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in  Anania's time -- for instance, problem 7.  Problem 7  Once I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank  of the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast.  We caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped out of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found  forty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.  The temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I'll restrain myself and offer you just one more.  Problem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that  inhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no mention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according  to the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of  Shirak offers evidence to the contrary .  Problem 20  The hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik,  was at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild donkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and,  running to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with his brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild  beasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by  arrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were  caught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And  so, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.    \\\"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli\\\"   His biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a   bibliography.     -- K Uzbashyan, Academician      Iosef Abgarovich Orbeli  Anyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the  solution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation  of Anania of Shirak's Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages, has probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders,  and the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great  attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for  a degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma  attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An  advertisement at the end of the book reads: \\\"This book was typeset in  December 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by  me, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with  borders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project  to the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.\\\"  Typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned  orientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage  Museum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had  already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis  Academiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its  rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish  the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian  churches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve  the unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G. Strolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the  blockade of Leningrad in World War II.)  When Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times  were hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania was for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the  printer's craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the  Academy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion of Russian academic typography.     Back to Earth   This book by definition does not exhaust all the most important   works in this domain. The editor hopes that those who are guilty   of this incompleteness will read these lines and, stung by shame,   will work up, if not a collection like this, at least a monograph.     --V.

Perhaps by then there will be more than n copies of his timeless Problems and Solutions. And  we can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by  Iosef Orbeli.

NEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE   * INQUIRY: Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage    by a man who infiltrated political groups  By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.  SAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world, Roy Bullock was a small-time art dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District.  In reality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40 years.  His code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal, and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) in her Washington, D.C., office.  For a time, Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White Aryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes.  From police sources he obtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people.  And he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government to trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills.  These are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a former Los Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with police and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide intelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League.  Officials of the Anti-Defamation League, while denying any improper activity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation.  They have refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz.  Transcripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents released by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory.  At times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air with laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like \\\"Ironsides\\\" and \\\"Flipper.\\\"  On one occasion, Gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a pro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa, Israel.  Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any ties to Israel, Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him.  Shortly afterward, another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed him.  The court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard, a former CIA agent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League.  Gerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the FBI, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker.  Its contents included passports, driver's licenses and identification cards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for four American embassies in Central America; and a collection of blank birth certificates, Army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies.  Also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, a black hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos of blindfolded and chained men.  Investigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the ADL confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of one target group, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee.  Each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony, San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant.  The Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civil rights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. The ADL's fact-finding division, headed by Irwinn Suall in New York, enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists.   However, evidence seized from Bullock's computer shows he kept files on at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Earth Island Institute, the United Farm Workers, Jews for Jesus, Mother Jones magazine, the Center for Investigative Reporting, the Bo Gritz for President Committee, the Asian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP.  The computer files also included information on several members of Congress, including Pelosi, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey from the Bay Area.  In their statements, Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation League has collected information on political activists in the Los Angeles area for more than 30 years.  They said they worked closely with three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who specialized in intelligence work, a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism expert and a San Diego County Sheriff's Department intelligence officer.  A spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation, and the San Diego Sheriff's Department declined comment.  Bullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama.  Although he is not Jewish, he began working undercover as a volunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party.  Bullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by the ADL as an intelligence operative, he told authorities.  In the mid-1970s, he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the West Coast.  To keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneled through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has never missed a payment in more than 32 years, Bullock said.  \\\"I was an investigator for the ADL.  I investigated any and all anti-democratic movements,\\\" Bullock said.  \\\". . . Officially, I'm only a contract worker with Bruce Hochman.  That way, the league would not be officially connected with me.\\\"  Bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists to Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own name but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink.  \\\"I'm one of a kind,\\\" he told police.  In recent years, however, his ADL affiliation has increasingly become known, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him.  In the mid-1980s, he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police.  In part because of this investigation, he became close friends with Gerard, who at the time was working in the San Francisco police intelligence division.  Bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups.  An FBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group:  \\\"Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, and would share the reports with Gerard.  Bullock also gave the trash to Gerard for Gerard to examine.  Gerard would later return the trash to Bullock.\\\"  From a wide range of sources, Bullock compiled files on 9,876 individuals and more than 950 political groups.  Gerard, whose files contained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people.  In 1987, Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the South African government.  Bullock tells of meetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100 bills.  Bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources. Once he rewrote an innocuous item published by San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African Bishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli -- and submitted it as his own work.  Bullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence.  Bullock said he split about $16,000 from the South African government evenly with Gerard, telling him at one point, \\\"I may be gay but I'm a straight arrow.\\\"  In his interviews with the police and FBI, Bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law.  For example, Bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records and criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer.  And he said Gerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence files on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy.  Bullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation of Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League's San Francisco office.  Bullock seemed proud of his \\\"Operation Eavesdrop,\\\" in which he used a paid informant, code-named Scumbag, to help tap into a White Aryan Resistance phone message network, listening to the messages left by members of the right-wing group.  \\\"For a short time, it was wonderful,\\\" he told police.  In Los Angeles, ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a \\\"fact-finder\\\" to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups.  Among other things, he told San Francisco authorities, the Los Angeles ADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had \\\"anti-Israel leanings\\\" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such sentiment.  Gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he attempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a rival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies.  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival and threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hate group.  Gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the probe, providing considerable information about the ADL operation.  Unlike Bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the investigation.  Gurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewed by The Times. Bullock's attorney said his client would not comment.\",\"  ------------ Part 11 of 14 ------------ MR1865%22DM75U=75U4)\\\"0IV=G9V=G9V=G9V=G9V=G9V=G9V=G9V=G9V=G9V=

(I think it was glues and such, as well as electronics, that they were worried about.)  Thus it had to remain furled and the axis _always_ pointed near the sun, so that the small sunshade at the tip of the antenna mast would shadow the folded HGA. (A larger sunshade beneath the antenna shielded the spacecraft bus.)\",\"   Are you your own master?  Do you have any habits that you cannot break? For one, you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the Bible.  Seems that ignorance has you mastered.  How about sexual sins?  Gotta any of those secret desires in your head that you harbor but can get control of?   Do you dehumanize women when they walk past you?  Do you degrade them to a sex object in your head?  Are you the master of that kind of thinking?  Do you insult people unknowingly, then regret it later.  Yet do it again the next time opportunity presents itself?  Are you truly the master of yourself?  I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times. That I sometimes say things I do want to say, and then repeat my mistake unwantingly.  I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect of my being.  There are times I know I shouldn't say something, but then say it anyway.  There are times I simply forget a lesson. I, in fact, am not my own master.  I need help.  Jesus promised me this help.  And I took him up on his offer.  I have willfully let Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than I myself do.  And why not?  Does not the creator know his creation better than the creation?  Does Toyota know what's better for the Corolla than the Corolla?   Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you.  Because Brian, you enjoy not having a clue about the Bible.       Can you witness motherly love with your senses?  How does caring and concern for you register with your senses?  If nothing registers to you other than what you can see, taste, smell, hear and touch, then you better become a Vulcan and fast.  You better get rid of your emotions.  And I do have a good reason to believe what I do.    The topic was about my God and your lack of knowledge about what my God says.   My God says that you will not CEASE EXISTING.  You have life forever.  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal torment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to  live it in paradise with God.  That is what my God says.  And that was the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  It's wishful thinking.    Is this the religion of Kendigianism?  Most people are not Christian.  Most people, including Christians,  are not fond of feeling that they are imperfect.  Is \\\"the world an undesireable place\\\" a doctrine of Kendigianism?  It has nothing to do with my God.  Does Kendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship? Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again?   Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the priest tells them like good little sheep?  Mine doesn't.  Is this a bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being  ignorant of the Bible?  Brian, following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism. You would find any of your doctrines in the Bible.   I don't follow Kendigianism. I follow Christ.   Also, to try to again show you your ignorance of Christ and the Bible in regards to \\\"priests\\\",  have you not read about the sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8?  Have you not read what the purpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should NOT be priests today?  Yes, guess what?  The Catholics messed up.  I do not follow Catholicism or any \\\"ism.\\\"  I follow Christ.   Why would you want to live a good life? To you, you die and that's it.  Don't contradict yourself.  You have no reason to live a good life.  It doesn't do you any good in the end.  Your life doesn't do anybody else any good  either because everyone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading a good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?   Has the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead. Jesus was sacrified to fufill the Old Testament sacrificial system in its every detail.  Jesus's death was like a seed.  He needed to fall to the ground so that many new lives would take root.  Did you miss the entire John passage as well?      Forget that I am a person.  Forget that I know how to type.  Forget that I know how to put a sentence together.  Forget that I know how to send e-mail.   Forget my existence.  Proove to me that I exist.  . \",\"    >Anyway, over the weekend, I was resting on the sofa (in between chores),    >and noticed that I briefly picked up what sounded like ham radio traffic    >over my stereo and television, even though both were off.

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to have a \\\"dirty\\\" amp.     Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,    that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs  Not possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.     for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt    radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet     away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.    If you experience the problem frequently, it may be     caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station    nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio     transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,    etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are    correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.     If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite    chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably    being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can    be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).    Good instructions are included with the chokes.    If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your    neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof    or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things    a radio operator can do to reduce interference.  And please remember to be friendly when approaching your local radio operator.  This person may or may not be the  cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most are).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes dealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b. interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.    BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or not he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it. Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers to take any precautions.  Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more than 10).  So if you hear \\\"This is WA1QT\\\" or some other call starting with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham. CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required to) and fire/police have other private ids.      \",\"It is very encouraging that a number of people took so interest in my posting.I recieved a couple of letters too,some has debated the statement that events in Bosnia are unprecedented in the history of the modern world.Those who contest this statement present the figures of the World War II.However we must keep in mind that it was a World War and no country had the POWER to stop it,today is the matter not of the POWER but of the WILL.It seems to be that what we lack is the will. Second point of difference (which makes it different from the holocast(sp?) ) is that at that time international community didnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event, today inspite of all the might,the international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo which is to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bully.Hence indirecltly and possibly unintentionally, mankind has sided with the killers.And this,I think is unprecedented in the history of the modern world.\",\"   Apple just released the Quicktime volume of the new Inside Macintosh series.

April 6, 1993  RELEASE:  93-64          Dr.  John H.  Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.          A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.          Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.          Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.          Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give \\\"full consideration\\\" to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.          To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.          Gibbons reiterated that, \\\"President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\\\"          NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.\",\" All true.  And all good points.    Well, making a career out of it is a bit strong.  I still believe that doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I would not have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent the many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done. And 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that  would help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank goodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine that helps me.    I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That you would go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second opinion, and then move on with your life. Just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in  this field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses. These are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over the country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going to a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was  helpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very unproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research, make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.  A recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of what I'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's not a put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors are only human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.  I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things that is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart, or failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That's because  those things are much more tangible and have much more concise  definitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have to decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to find your way out of it.   I have chosen the latter.   Linda lindae@netcom.netcom.com \",\"In <lsjc8cINNmc1@saltillo.cs.utexas.edu> turpin@cs.utexas.edu (Russell Turpin)   I regard love as no more or less \\\"benign\\\" than any other Christian does. You are merely expressing \\\"approval\\\" of the consequences I find therein. Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my (or any) religion.  \\\"Love\\\" is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christians can write both the \\\"gentle\\\" words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in a passage that even the \\\"conservatives\\\" will quote at you :-) -- and the words of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, \\\"Love is the unfamiliar Name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...\\\"  This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise in my note, as will become more evident below.   blechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though, given my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of \\\"sin\\\" on another, and my unshakeable \\\"disestablishmentarianism\\\", Russel Turpin and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my legislating my own understanding of Christian love.   You misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \\\"God\\\" in near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:  The \\\"possibility that always exists\\\" is that I (or, to revert to proper time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could persuade \\\"Christian B\\\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian argumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian] prohibitions.  What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:   A.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved      in the Inquisition.   B.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however      painful this *seems*, \\\"discipline\\\" her children for their      own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or      if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example      \\\"deterring\\\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)   A.  I point out that this \\\"justification\\\" of a failure in love      depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of      philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.   B.  Burns me at the stake.  My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is going on here has a *lot* to do with \\\"cultural baggage.\\\"  In this case, the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between A and B.  Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B, then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what- ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense attorney.  So, \\\"one possibility\\\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in may others.  At the other extreme, the \\\"persuasion\\\" will succeed when it properly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the Inquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that many of the victims of Inquisition will have \\\"accepted\\\" that they were in fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them.)  The point is that the \\\"persuasion\\\" breaks down when the parties do NOT share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main thrust of the Inquisition, against \\\"heresy\\\", it is *bound* to break down in precisely the \\\"worst\\\" cases.  The \\\"conservative\\\" (I don't think that is the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above, that he is \\\"justified\\\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to a \\\"greater good.\\\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow the gospel, as if one's theories about \\\"sin\\\" entitled one to cast aside Jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).  I am a \\\"radical\\\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.   Well, the whole *point* of making these the \\\"base\\\" commandments is that they *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great Commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A demand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important that I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \\\"Conservatives\\\" may twist this \\\"act as if you were God\\\" to mean \\\"lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules.\\\" They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy IS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \\\"against God\\\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \\\"conservatives\\\" have confused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard American atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.   And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged *different* \\\"ethical systems\\\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result, it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular (or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH. It does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very little, if anything, in the way of \\\"commandments\\\" -- so little that the \\\"Christians\\\" who desperately *want* commandments go \\\"mining\\\" for them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-)) for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus specifically \\\"gives\\\" as \\\"a commandment\\\" to us is \\\"love one another.\\\"   [I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson   that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that   SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll   point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why   there is a huge amount of \\\"cultural baggage\\\" involved.]  You are quite right that this is \\\"goo\\\" if one is looking for an ethical system.  But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.   I think you are begging the question. Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity? [Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]\",\"I'd like to add a second S3 based video card to my system.

[DD]  Problem 1 [DD] [DD] My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the  [DD] Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed  [DD] extraordinary heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the  [DD] Persian troops. The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army.  [DD] The second time, pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the  [DD] soldiers. The third time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army.  [DD] The Persians who were still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to  [DD] Nakhichevan. And so, from this remainder, find how many Persian soldiers  [DD] there were before the massacre.  [Koc] Answer: a(1-1/2-1/4-1/11)=280 -> a = 1760  Good for you! You win the prize -- a free trip to Karabakh as an Azeri  soldier! Now, calculate the odds of you coming back after trying to de-populate the area of Armenians!  [Koc] Corollary: Armenians strike, slaughter, destroy, and massacre. After [Koc] all, they are not as innocent as the asala network claims.  Fact: I didn't notice any mention of Turks in Shirak, Van, or Trebizon in       this seventh century story!  Fact: These places were filled with Armenians as of 1915.  Fact: By the end of 1916, after the Turkish genocide of the Armenians, there       were no Armenians left in Shirak, Van, or Trebizon -- only Turks and       Kurds! In fact, there were no Pontus Greeks left alive in Trebizon        either!

Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands.  To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.  Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print.

(1992):  _Biological Psychology_. Wadsworth Publishing Co. Belmont, CA.  Pg. 219.  Reproduced without permission.]    Digression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors  Although the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practically tasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle berries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in such a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile,  Moskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle berry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids  (which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste sour as well.  Miraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a diet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin pill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such substances would taste sweet without providing many calories.  A colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries. We drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tasted extremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  We  awoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.  [... continued discussion of a couple other taste-altering substances ...]   Refs:    Bartoshuk, L.M., Gentile, R.L., Moskowitz, H.R., & Meiselman, H.L.

Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects for both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on high-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames per second).     It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is. True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations.  Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15 frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general does not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the UNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time operation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes.  Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time operation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not even SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due to their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.  From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2 systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.    You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop VR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

Xt Glossary ----------------------------------------------------------------------  o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code   to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with   this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,   RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,   etc.  The terms \\\"Xt\\\" and \\\"Intrinsics\\\" are used interchangeably,   however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X   window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,   Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the   Intrinsics are not especially useful.  o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The   precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It   is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the   Object class although these are more accurately called windowless   widgets or gadgets.  o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below   the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib   functions because Xt provides most such services although an   understanding of Xlib helps with problems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  In brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for critical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the appropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a list traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.  The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the interrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous to add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never be called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop about the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal. However, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.  Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.          Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4.  How do I use a different visual than the default? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has three things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and border pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap resource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions deals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen and DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is not properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is created.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends on the visual being used.    How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier because the basic information you need is available.  The first is a little harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the needed information.  /*  * Some sample code to start up an application using something other  * than the default visual.  *  * To compile:  * cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm  *  * To run:  * ./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow  *  * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap  * to install.  */  #include <X11/Intrinsic.h> #include <X11/StringDefs.h> #include <X11/Shell.h>  typedef struct {  Visual *visual;  int depth; } OptionsRec;  OptionsRec Options;  XtResource resources[] = {  {\\\"visual\\\", \\\"Visual\\\", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *),  XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL},  {\\\"depth\\\", \\\"Depth\\\", XtRInt, sizeof (int),  XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL}, };  XrmOptionDescRec Desc[] = {  {\\\"-visual\\\", \\\"*visual\\\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL},  {\\\"-depth\\\", \\\"*depth\\\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL} };    int main (argc, argv)  int  argc;  char  **argv; {  XtAppContext app;  /* the application context */  Widget  top;  /* toplevel widget */  Display  *dpy;  /* display */  char  **xargv; /* saved argument vector */  int  xargc;  /* saved argument count */  Colormap colormap; /* created colormap */  XVisualInfo vinfo;  /* template for find visual */  XVisualInfo *vinfo_list; /* returned list of visuals */  int  count;  /* number of matchs (only 1?) */  Arg  args[10];  Cardinal cnt;  char  *name = \\\"test\\\";  char  *class = \\\"Test\\\";   /*   * save the command line arguments   */   xargc = argc;  xargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *));  bcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));   /*   * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can   * retrieve the appropriate visual resource.   */  cnt = 0;  top = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv,           (String *) NULL, args, cnt);  dpy = XtDisplay (top);  cnt = 0;  XtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources,        XtNumber (resources),        args, cnt);  cnt = 0;  if (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top)))  {   XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt;   /*    * Now we create an appropriate colormap.  We could    * use a default colormap based on the class of the    * visual; we could examine some property on the    * rootwindow to find the right colormap; we could    * do all sorts of things...    */   colormap = XCreateColormap (dpy,          RootWindowOfScreen (XtScreen (top)),          Options.visual,          AllocNone);   XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNcolormap, colormap); ++cnt;    /*    * Now find some information about the visual.    */   vinfo.visualid = XVisualIDFromVisual (Options.visual);   vinfo_list = XGetVisualInfo (dpy, VisualIDMask, &vinfo, &count);   if (vinfo_list && count > 0)   {    XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNdepth, vinfo_list[0].depth);    ++cnt;    XFree ((XPointer) vinfo_list);   }  }  XtDestroyWidget (top);    /*   * Now create the real toplevel widget.   */  XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNargv, xargv); ++cnt;  XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNargc, xargc); ++cnt;  top = XtAppCreateShell ((char *) NULL, class,     applicationShellWidgetClass,     dpy, args, cnt);   /*   * Display the application and loop handling all events.   */  XtRealizeWidget (top);  XtAppMainLoop (app);  return (0); }  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 5.  Which visual should an application use? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to be specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your application probably falls into the category of always using the default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular visual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some such).  Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server allocates resources I may not always want your application to run in TrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may be very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor or just monochrome.  As an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different possible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static color, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above  plus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that shell.  A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have its own realize method to use the visual when it calls XCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be obtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A reasonable value is probably XtNvisual.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This is interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen() and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e. it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.  If the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies colormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the visual.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This was especially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  See section 2.8 of the Xt specification.  It eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The Intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed. It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any pending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned up before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then performed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have completed, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the list is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among other things.  As some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the Intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the widgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs immediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not destroyed until returning to the outer event loop.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting an application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget may not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open sockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):    Widget  ToplevelGet (gw)   Widget  gw;  /* widget to find toplevel */  {   Widget  top;    for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))    /* empty */;   return (top);  }   void  ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)   Widget  gw;  /* widget */   XtPointer closure; /* data the app specified */   XtPointer call_data; /* widget specific data */  {   Widget  toplevel;    toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);   XtUnmapWidget (toplevel); /* make it disappear quickly */   XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);   exit (0);  }  One can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying the toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never occur.    This works for most widgets and most applications but will not work for those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant of the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the widget may change and someday require that some external state is cleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.  One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and difficult to maintain practices.  Try the following code instead.   #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>   extern Widget ToplevelGet (  #if NeedFunctionPrototypes   Widget  gw  #endif  );   extern Boolean ExitWorkProc (  #if NeedFunctionPrototypes   XtPointer closure  #endif  );   extern void ExitCallback (  #if NeedFunctionPrototypes   Widget  gw,   XtPointer closure,   XtPointer call_data  #endif  );   Widget  ToplevelGet (gw)  Widget  gw;  /* widget to find toplevel */  {   Widget  top;    for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))    /* empty */;   return (top);  }    void  ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)  Widget  gw;  /* widget */  XtPointer closure; /* data the app specified */  XtPointer call_data; /* widget specific data */  {   Widget  toplevel;    toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);   XtUnmapWidget (toplevel); /* make it disappear quickly */   XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);   XtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),       ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);  }   Boolean  ExitWorkProc (closure)   XtPointer closure;  {   exit (0);   /*NOTREACHED*/  }   ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the application is next idle -- which happens after all the events are processed and the destroy callbacks are executed.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. How do I resize a Shell widget? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  After it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper thing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget using XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the Shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the request.  However, the Shell must have the resource XtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the window manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.  To change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not the child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  It does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does not fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not block, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to block.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For a file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF -- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to be read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based OS's it is the poll() system call.  How to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use another process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe to connect the application with this other process and pass the file descriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on BSD systems is \\\"tail -f filename\\\".  It's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_ reliable.  In particular:   - IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while    (several thousand times) and then stop until some other    event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race    condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.   - Pyramid, doesn't work at all.   - Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as    sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing    side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it    all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at    a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks    (get raound it by detecting the situation and having    select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had    been given the whole block).   Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as read(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and may not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with part of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this point I don't know.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  I have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full details of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already familiar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may not find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, which means its a 1000 pages.  Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., \\\"X Window System Toolkit, The  Complete Programmer's Guide and Specification\\\", Digital Press,  1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by  Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC  Direct at 1-800-DIGITAL.  The other book I commonly recomend to novices is:  Young, Doug. \\\"The X Window System: Applications and Programming with  Xt (Motif Version),\\\" Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8).  (ISBN 0-13-972167-3)  And of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt. O'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt reference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively overhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding it very useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related information.  I read two periodicals, \\\"The X Resource\\\" and the \\\"The X Journal\\\". These are the only two dealing specifically with X.  \\\"The X Resource\\\" is published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being the MIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no advertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  For orders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorial matters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted at math.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in ~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.   \\\"The X Journal\\\" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising. The articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical audience.  I read it more to see what's going on then with an expectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a fairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty good collection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call (908) 563-9033.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 14. What Widgets are available? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  There are three popular widget sets:  Athena - The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most    purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is    available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z. Motif - From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on    many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but    Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think    it is poorly implemented. OLIT - The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets    implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by    AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.    I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.  In addition the following collection of widgets are also available:  Xtra - a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software    Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked    bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,    spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen    them so I can't comment. FWF - The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of    freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,    FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets    can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine    a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z. Xcu - The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the    early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for    buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so    widely used. Xs - The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but    seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise. Xw - The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written    for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.    Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.    The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was    originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided    much experience for the designers of Xt. Xo - A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you    can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*  The following specialized widgets are also available:  Tbl - Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif    widgets as children.  Part of Wcl. Plots - The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).    Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there? ----------------------------------------------------------------------   __________________________________________  Name  Language Vendor  __________________________________________  Xview  C  Sun  OI  C++  ParcPlace  Interviews C++  Stanford  Tcl/tk  C  sprite.berkeley.edu  __________________________________________   However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and implementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop in the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language other than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  First, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)  typdef struct  {       String name;      long value;  } Arg;  and the code:  Arg arg;   XtSetArg (arg, \\\"name\\\", 3.2)  expands to  Arg arg;   arg.name = \\\"name\\\";  arg.value = 3.2;  you can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value gets the integer \\\"3\\\" instead of the floating point value \\\"3.2\\\".  When the value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is wildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So, how to get around this?  The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now recomending it over the previous suggestions.  #define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\\\     if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\\\         XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\\\     } else { \\\\         XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\\\         XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\\\     }   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. How do I write a resource converter? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Courtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):  The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5) Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow for destructors and caching of converted values.  There are several main types of resource converters:      string to data type     data type to string     data type to data type  i) string to data type     Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings     that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often     used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:   Name  Value  \\\"True\\\"  1  \\\"False\\\"  0      In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare     the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most     readily accomplished by the use of the \\\"quark\\\" mechanism of the     resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,     which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a     single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the     quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.      If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many     converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then     a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the     resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of     these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks     and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one     of the converters.  ii) data type to string     This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data     type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,     the data type value is simply converted to a string value,     probably by the use of sprintf.      Data type to string converters are useful for applications that     wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that     they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This     mechanism can be used to provide a \\\"snapshot\\\" of application state     into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to     a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.      If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type     converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to     string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure     that they are consistent.  iii) data type to data type     This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type     value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be     converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for     red, green and blue.   The type signature for a resource converter is as follows:  typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,  XrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);     Display *dpy;     XrmValuePtr args;     Cardinal *num_args;     XrmValuePtr fromVal;     XrmValuePtr toVal;     XtPointer *converter_data;  When the converter is invoked, the \\\"fromVal\\\" argument points to the source X resource manager value and the \\\"toVal\\\" argument points to the destination X resource manager value.  The \\\"converter_data\\\" argument is an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified when the converter is registered.  The \\\"args\\\" and \\\"num_args\\\" arguments allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is invoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the Pixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.  Care must be taken with the \\\"toVal\\\" argument.  An XrmValue has the following type definition and specifies a size and location for a converted value:  typedef struct {     unsigned int    size;     caddr_t         addr; } XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;  When the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of the given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL. In the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the destination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If the destination area is not large enough, then the converter should set the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the converter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply copy the converted value into the space given and return True.  If the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to the address of a static variable containing the converted value and return True.  When writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it becomes convenient to define a macro:      #define DONE(var, type) \\\\       if (toVal->addr) \\\\  { \\\\    if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\\      { \\\\        toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\        return False; \\\\      } \\\\    else \\\\      *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\\  } \\\\       else \\\\  toVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\\\       toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\       return True;      #define DONESTR(str) \\\\       if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\\  { \\\\    toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\    return False; \\\\  } \\\\       else \\\\  toVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\\\       toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\       return True;  Inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety checking on the \\\"num_args\\\" and \\\"args\\\" arguments to ensure that your converter is being called properly.  Once you have written your converter, you need to register it with the Intrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.  To register a converter with a single application context, use XtAppSetTypeConverter:  void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,  cache, destructor)     XtAppContext context;     String from;     String to;     XtTypeConverter converter;     XtConvertArgList args;     Cardinal num_args;     XtCacheType cache;     XtDestructor destructor;  To register a converter with all application contexts, use XtSetTypeConverter:  void XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,  cache, destructor)     String from;     String to;     XtTypeConverter converter;     XtConvertArgList args;     Cardinal num_args;     XtCacheType cache;     XtDestructor destructor;  In the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and XtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter and XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be used.  When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a \\\"cache\\\" argument specifies how converted resource values are to be cached:      XtCacheNone  Don't cache any converted values     XtCacheAll  Cache all converted values     XtCacheByDisplay Cache converted values on a per display basis  Caching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a good idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).  The \\\"destructor\\\" argument is a routine that is invoked then the resource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is being destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:  typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,  XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);     XtAppContext context;     XrmValuePtr to;     XtPointer converter_data;     XrmValuePtr args;     Cardinal *num_args;  The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated with the \\\"to\\\" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed to by the \\\"to\\\" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the conversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments for the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to free the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private data passed in when the converter was registered.  Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT R5 distribution:      mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c     contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c     contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. How do I open multiple displays? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  See \\\"Multi-user Application Software Using Xt\\\", The X Resource, Issue 3, (Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues involved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a nutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_ application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display and remove it from the application context.  The real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can happen 3 ways:  1. User selects a \\\"quit\\\" button on one of the displays,  2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,  3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,     server shutdown/crash, or network failure.  I'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a problem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that display.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.  The third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the Oliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult problem.  The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O error is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true for a single display X based application, but not true for a multiple display program or an application that does things other than display information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the I/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit() happens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid returning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment demonstrates this:  #include <setjmp.h> jmp_buf XIOrecover;  void XIOHandler (dpy)  Display  *dpy; {  destroyDisplay (dpy);  longjmp (XIOrecover, 1); }  main () {  ...  if (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)   XSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);  XtAppMainLoop (app_context); }  The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go back to the application specific data and perform any necessary cleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().  For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is first called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the jmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to the same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value of this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to longjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this purpose it is adequate.  Some other problems you might run into are resource converters that improperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors such as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical value.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to connect to a display.  There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in November of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically said this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 19.

First, the general changes for each release are described.  Then a, certainly incomplete, list of new functions added and others that are now deprecated are listed.  Brevity is a primary goal.

Where are the resources loaded from? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places (from highest priority to lowest priority):   1. Args passed at creation time.  2. Command line arguments.  3. User's per host defaults file  4. User's defaults file.  5. User's per application default file.  6. System wide per application default file.  Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result of steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.  The per host defaults file contains customizations for all applications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either specified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.  The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program \\\"xrdb\\\" is used to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the display must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is reasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER but most do not.  A user may have many per application default files containing customizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.  The system wide per application default files are typically found in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the fallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.  [Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]  You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.  Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located):   setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N  The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see XtResolvePathname()):   %N The value of the filename parameter, or the   application's class name.  %T The value of the file \\\"type\\\".  In this case, the   literal string \\\"app-defaults\\\"  %C customization resource (R5 only)  %S Suffix.  None for app-defaults.  %L Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \\\"ja_JP.EUC\\\")  %l Language part of %L  (e.g. \\\"ja\\\")  %t The territory part of the display's language string  %c The codeset part of the display's language string  Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is \\\"Myterm\\\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm  $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm  As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.  Let's consider another example. This time, let's set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.   setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N  The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,       for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is       defined so %T and %S are useless.  With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization resource value.  For example, you might run the \\\"myterm\\\" application like this:   myterm -xrm \\\"*customization: -color\\\"  If one of your pathname specifications had the value \\\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C\\\" then the expanded pathname would be \\\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\\\" because the %C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource.  The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:    /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N  (Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings.)  The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is     <root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   <root>/%L/%N:\\\\   <root>/%l/%N:\\\\   <root>/%N:  <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.  Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to \\\".\\\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \\\"./\\\", a dot followed by a slash.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. What order are callbacks executed in? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)  The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to modify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one currently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot guarantee the order of execution.  The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have; therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the list.  Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback    \\\"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the   procedure is to be appended.\\\"   you may not infer from the word \\\"appended\\\" that the callback routines are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback list.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 22. How do I know if a widget is visible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)   Right, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a \\\"deficiency\\\" in the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the protocol.  (The \\\"deficiency\\\" is that the information is available in one way, in this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section carefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.  A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from viewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped; that is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency. Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol; see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.   You'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.   As an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action routine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget which contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the map_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are suggestions.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  You can't.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc() tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is handled something like:   ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))  if (!ptr)  {   perror (\\\"malloc in xyzzy()\\\");   exit (1)  } To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions XtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which all use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and realloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.  In addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses XtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:   if (!ptr)   ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));  else   ptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));  ++count;  to be written as:   ptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);  Also, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I've found the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'm allocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so I can fully recover from not enough memory errors.  XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a structure or copying a string:     struct abc *xyzzy;    char      *ptr;    char      *str = \\\"abcdef\\\";     xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc); /* takes care of type casting */    ptr = XtNewString (str);  A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with malloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:    char       *ptr;    ptr = XtMalloc (100);   /* ... */   free (ptr);  may not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did this broken and complain to the vendor.  A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string when they should really be using XmStringFree().  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. How to debug an Xt application? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First, I'd recomend getting \\\"purify\\\" from Pure Software.  This is a great package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey at $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb (contact support@pure.com for more info).   Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into  the object code produced by existing compilers.  These  instructions check every memory read and write performed by  the program under test and detect several types of access  errors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past  malloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts  checking logic into all of the code in a program, including  third party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies  system call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory  usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel  adaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly  comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program  down typically by a factor of two to five.  An alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on many Unix's and has pretty similar features is \\\"The SENTINEL Debugging Environment\\\".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library functions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com for more info)  Next, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run in synchronous mode, easily accomplished with the \\\"-sync\\\" command line argument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then set a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the original Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous mode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to Xlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the server are asynchronous.  Next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the undocumented resource \\\"xtIdentifyWindows\\\" or the class resource \\\"XtDebug\\\" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window. For example:      example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &     example% xwininfo -tree       <click in new xload window>  will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each window is included.  This can help for checking the location and size of errant widgets.  Next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to test the way a widget manages it's children, you can try export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour of both.  It's a very clever idea.  The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from a pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to go to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands. Unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to your application which is stopped.  The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on your desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment) on one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly using a command sequence like this:   othermachine% xhost +thismachine  thismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;  thismachine% gdb application # Your favorite debugger.  or this:  othermachine% xhost +thismachine  thismachine% gdb application  (gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0  (gdb) run ...  I believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method of dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to release any grabs during breakpoints.  Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and knowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing the internals of a particular widget but not very far without understanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great deal.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work? ----------------------------------------------------------------------    I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,    XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when    I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.    I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works    perfect, but in my \\\"real\\\" application nothing happens.   The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those routines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is they use a default application context different then the one you may have created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per application context basis and you are using two application contexts, you won't get those events.  For example:   ...  cnt = 0;  toplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,        Desc, XtNumber (Desc),        &argc, argv,        Fallback, args, cnt);   XtAddTimeOut (...)  XtAddWorkProc (...)   XtAppMainLoop (app)  would never invoke the timeout.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)  Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an ``intuitive'' fashion.  Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has supported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with each other, and so far as I know, they are not published.  I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public protocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to support a \\\"standard\\\" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop and contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long as it is based on Xt).  The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM conventions, for more details read the code.  I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that it works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif anyway.  The latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from netcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.  A (possibly older) version is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib.\",\" e,  If memory serves me well, Alicea hit it, and damn near tied the game.

According to Jerry Taylor, Cato's director of natural resource studies,   we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10   times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of   1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as   dramatically.      When standards of living, population densities, and industrial   structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy   efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group   of Seven nations.      Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil   price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the   cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,   even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the   overall U.S. economy.      Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per   $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.      Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side   management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource   inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not   reduce demand.      Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes   unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that   subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,   gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood   of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state   at the expense of the individual.      \\\"Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion\\\" is no.   189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an   independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.

To that end, the Institute strives to achieve   greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in    questions of policy and the proper role of government.     The Institute is named for Cato's Letters, libertarian pamphlets   that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th   century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation   of the American Revolution.     Despite the achievement of the nation's Founders, today virtually   no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive   intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary   intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for   civil liberties.     To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive   publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy   issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned   to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military   spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy   conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are   published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.     In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts   no government funding.  Contributions are received from foundations,   corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from   the sale of publications.  The Institute is a nonprofit, tax-exempt,   educational foundation under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue   Code.\",\"Obesssive Compulsive Disorder (not to be confused with Obsessive Compulsive _Personality_ Disorder !) is an acute anxiety disorder characterized by either obsessions (persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety when not entertained), or compulsions (repetitive, ritualistic actions that similarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted).    OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression.    Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved one (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person having  recurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally, the individual attempts to ignore or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.   The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rather than being from an external source.  Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing, or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a source of the anxiety.  In OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the individual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair their daily routine and social relationships.  Treatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimes certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating obsessions and compulsions.

The first clause is not a condition, it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right WHICH EXISTS, MILITIA OR NOT, that the people have a right to keep and bear arms.

Neil Schulman  If you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan, right ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call would be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call if you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?  That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr. Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of \\\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\\\"  A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's expertise.  Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at USC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for \\\"Editor and Publisher\\\", a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field.  He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's fifth book on usage, \\\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\\\" has been in continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.  That sounds like an expert to me.  After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent the following letter:  \\\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in English usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.  \\\"The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further, since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under oath to support, if necessary.\\\"  My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment, then concluded:  \\\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment. While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\\\"  After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political subject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity):  [Copperud:] \\\"The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a clause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb 'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia.  \\\"In reply to your numbered questions:  [Schulman:] \\\"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted by the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state that such right 'shall not be infringed'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence is assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact necessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not existing, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed' null and void?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as previously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated militia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,' 'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200 years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \\\"Since a well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'  [Schulman:] \\\"As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second Amendment to the following sentence,  \\\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,  \\\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?; and  \\\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people to keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure.  \\\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation.\\\"  Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his cover letter: \\\"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach any conclusion.\\\"  So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally protects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.  As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the Soviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.  And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely. American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms, guaranteed by the Constitution.  And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the rest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.  it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding them as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?  Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution of the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend that promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?

Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfield's   slugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. I still think that   dave was one of the BETTER of all time, but obviously not the best. He was   one of the best athletes evr to play baseball. He hit line drives that hit   the scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new   Stadium. Heck, only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence   since it has been remodeled. He could field, had a bullet arm, and his   hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields, and barry bonds   of last season.

My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the bottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the 46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have large, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get them :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the waist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece size that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's problems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and when I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).  I can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are in some way different from us real folks.  Also, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands. I've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a store wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom in any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my sidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally leave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall down unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight), stuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit), and run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be running errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...  As far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably equal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by 3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around the waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.  So I'd have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit, I still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I own.  Wouldn't go long distance without it.

Please mail me if you feel you can help, and I will send you my questions.  Thanks in advance,\",\"I am having trouble with SCSI on a Mac IIfx. The machine is 3 years old and I have been using the same hard drive (internal Maxtor LXT-200S) for two and a half years. The disk recently crashed. I reformatted (Silverlining 5.42), but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing. The error message reported was like:  Sector 0: Write error detected after testing good - sector not mapped out.  This occurred randomly all over the hard disk (which makes me suspect the diagnostic's reference to Sector 0 ??? ). On the third reformat and after reinstalling the SCSI read/write loops I was able to get through passes 2,3, and 4 with no errors. (Pass 1 for some reason reported a lot of errors, but still mapped out no sectors.) I decided to go ahead and try to resinstall System 7 and reload my data from a backup. This proceded normally; however, I now have sub-optimal performance. Symptoms include:     o Frequent crashes    o Instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to        correct.    o Instances of not finding the disk on the SCSI chain on reboot.        - If I boot from Norton Utl. after this occurs, it cannot find the          disk either.        - The only thing that fixes this is recycling the power. It sometimes          requires several attempts.  QUESTIONS:     1) Has anyone had this type of problem before?    2) Is the problem with the fx motherboard (And its non-standard       SCSI implementation) or with my Maxtor Disk? Is there some       diagnostic software that would help me make this determination?    3) Is it a termination problem? I currently have external Syquest       and an external DataFrame XP60 on the chain. The XP60 is at the       end, and has internal termination; so I am not using the IIfx       terminator. I do have the SCSI filter installed on the internal       drive. I have run with this exact steup for 2 1/2 years with       one previous disk crash requiring a reformat (about a year ago).       I also have symptoms if I disconnect the external devices;       so I don't see how SCSI termination would now be an issue. Of       course who knows :-<  Help would be much appreciated.\",\"Hi  Can someone please give me some pointers to setting up imake in a SUN OPENWINDOWS enviornment ?

I think that it is important to protect your trunk, engine bay, all doors.  I'd get flashing lights, LED's mounted on the drivers and passenger door and a relay to disable engine operation. Toss in  a glass break sensor, and shock sensor. Door lock and unlock, two remotes and panic feature are also nice to have.  Most important is where you have the installation done!  Some places may cost a little more, but a poorly installed alarm (no matter how much it cost) will be a major burden.

It's in the hands of cops, and while I am sure most of the time they are good, their security will not be as good as the escrow houses.   What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you, at the end of the wiretap, they should be obligated to inform you that a tap was performed, and replace (for free) the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the escrow houses.  Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are laid?   In many ways, it would be a positive step if they had to. Judges set time limits on warrants, I assume.  At the end of the time limit they should have to renew or replace your chip.

Symthe Division playoff hockey this was.  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the opening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out- standing team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record their first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on penalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play  and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had their problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10 tries.  The Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the blue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the  Flames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex- pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse in his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to  the dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this  morning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.  1st period:  1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won the draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the puck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up in 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where Sydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the  hash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.  Millen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings failed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert. Dahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30 second 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in the period.  2nd period:  The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed to convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into the stands and received a delay of game.  1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the puck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit  the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated  down the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and skated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him  and he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.  2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play. Shuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed for the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot  where 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson came from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot between the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.  3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off the puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass cross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot, beating a diving Vernon on the glove side.  4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his own rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.  Skrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at 12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they failed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive power plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high sticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The Kings hit 3 goal post in the period.  3rd period: The Kings used the phrase \\\"Initiate, not retaliate\\\" and it was very evident here in the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames  continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.  5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot the puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to cut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him, wacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the crease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.  Sydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.  5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the  crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.  Carson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury tripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where  Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing  a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the  Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at  8:19) took penalties.    5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near  point, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the net, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of Hrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.  6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play to seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone  cut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed  the puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass,  beating Vernon on the ice, stick side.  At the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he went after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames right out of the game.  On the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey as they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent penalty killing.  On the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or the Flames will surely get that power play back on track.  Notes: ------ The Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.  Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.  The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving the opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.  Flames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon  games.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power play over their last 9 games.

In 1943, this battalion  had grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of Dro  (the butcher) who is the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5  million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council  was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was  recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily  formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the  principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the  Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination  of the Jews.  This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \\\"encore\\\" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.

In the meantime everyone he mentions has died and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established.

From your post, you apparently find the idea that something is wrong with African Americans, value-wise, culture wise or something, very appealing. I never cease to be amazed at how eager non african americans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assert that something is wrong with us. The socio-economic factors which we know help  to produce high crime levels, like poverty, which exists among us in large  proportion, I mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems, we somehow become exempt from all these types of factors, and the problem is  laid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have. But  nobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction. No, that has  socioeconomic factors to it, but for africa americans, its gotta be a  dysfunction.  Basically, I think this tendency for non african americans to believe that something is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want to deal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african americans, and that this is about 80% of the problem. It could not possible be that the society is so deeply racist and structured against us, that this has a very effective negative effect on us. No, something is wrong with us. Non african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say, because they  are so busy trying to find something wrong with us, instead of taking a good  hard look at the thing we say are doing us damage.

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt, reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.  Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch.  That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game, Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about  winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch.  Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any  that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible.  Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games.  I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play, he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.  But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan.    -- The Beastmaster   \",\"Does anyone know the difference between MOOLIT and OLIT?  Does Sun support MOOLIT?

In which case, the United States already has adaquate gun control laws: According to federal statistic, only 7% of gun-wielding criminals legally purchase their own guns from licensed dealers. If that's the point of gun control (to prevent criminals from legally purchasing guns) then America doesn't need any additional laws to accomplish this.   How is this any different from guns? There are legal purposes for owning and using a gun: They are appropriate tools for hunting, target shooting and self-defence. Like cars, murder isn't their only (or even a common) use.   I certainly couldn't imagine the American public accepting regulation of axes. While the politics of other nations may be different, in America there is strong opposition to any intrusive law that primarily would effect the average, law-abiding citizen who had not done anything wrong.   A good way to deal with which problem? It is an excelent way to deal  with the short-term problem of rioting and violent attacks. Of course, it doesn't do anything for the long-term issues that start riots. But at this point, what can these individuals do about long-term social problems?    There are, according to surveys, guns in 40% of American homes. In many parts of the country, this is closer to 100%. Those places where almost everyone owns a gun are, on average, safer than those where guns are less common.   This is, I think, a fundamental difference between American government and that of other nations.

God is said to require certain behavior, but the only compulsion is the believer's sense of duty. A standard of conduct does exist, but we are free to ignore it or misunderstand it or distort it in whatever ways we find convenient, but our response to God's edicts can in no way be used to question God's existence. The behavior of believers is a completely separate question from that of God's existence; there is nothing contradictory here.  To say that something defined contadictorily cannot exist, is really asking too much; you would have existence depend on grammar. All you can really say is that something is poorly defined, but that in itself is insufficient to decide anything (other than confusion of course).  Your point that there are better reasons for the phenomenon of belief than the object of belief may lead to a rat's nest of unnecessary complexity. I think I know what you're implying, but I'd like to see your version of this better alternative just the same.\",\" box, manual, phonecord    $25 + shipping Dennis \",\"   Almost all window managers (twm, mwm, olwm and their derivates) support escape sequences for it.

As a result mail order companies have to obtain their machines by the grey market.  This market is supplied with machines from authorised resellers who have more machines than they can sell.  They come into this state of affairs by overordering either accidentally or deliberatly to get a better wholsale price from Apple.  In either case they often obscure the serial nunber to protect their identity.  As a result the warranty is void.  You may save on sales tax but you have to pay for shipping.  I should also point out that mail order companies cannot get lower prices thatn the high volume authorised dealers unless they buy below dealer cost.  As a result the only way they can sell cheaper is by cutting costs and trimming margins.  Unfortunatly they dont seem to be doing too well.  The lowest prices I have been quoted mailorder do not beat the lowest prices available from authorised local dealers.  They are even further away from educational prices.\",\"I have one thing to say-- why does everyone say that spliting them up is such a bad thing?

Maybe it will help others here, anyway, and therefore I pray others will read this.  It is actually a response from my Aunt, who has 5 kids, since I have none yet.       I'm posting this for a good Christian relative who does not have e-mail access.  Since this aunt and uncle have 5 kids I felt they would be more relevant than I, who have none (yet).       13-year-old (13YO) twins, 10YO boy, 6.5YO boy, 2YO girl       I don't call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.       I don't call it spanking because it's more of a reaction to something very dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running into the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has not been spanked yet.      They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course I give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they're still loved.       No, that would be too painful.  If it's too traumatic they never recall why they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time to go get a toolmeans you're not doing it right away, and that lessens the impact.  It's very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the fact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds - is called a spanking.      Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared a good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made sure they didn't play together for 5 days so he'd know that would make him lose friends very quickly.  He's never done anything like that since.      We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don't keep arguing with me over leaving, since it's hard to argue with a macine. I will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won't be over until they calm down if they're too tantrumy.  I use the top of the stairs when they're really young.       40       Bath, Ohio.  It's right outside of Akron, in the northeast part of Ohio.       No, and none of my kids would dream of it.  I hope you can use this to teach all parents that physical punishment isn't always required - parents use that as an excuse to hit too hard.       Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband's have never used spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they were almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And, none of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God's law.      Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that \\\"what ye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.\\\"  The Bible also says in all things to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.) There is no room for selfish anger, which I'll admit I've been tempted with at times.  When I've felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved a little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the devil's work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid to his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God's forgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that what I had done was enough punishment.\",\" Dr. cheghadr bA namakand!

I think this is where the water is getting in.  When I first got it (had it for a month), one of the rear taillights fogged up with moisture.  I took it in to the dealer and they replaced the entire assembly.  It happened to the other one about 3 months later.  This time I happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there.  The dealer was more reluctant this time to replace it.  But I convinced them to fix it.

(Design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the MOSIS scalable design rules.) Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors:  1) They don't help much with simultaneous output switching--there is  still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the  load capacitor (on both the signal line and the ground  return), so you still get ground and power line bounce.   2) They do help a lot with on-chip loads, as I had with the high load  on the clock lines.   3) The transients you are trying to suppress are really high  frequency, so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff  capacitors, since the RC time constant is too large.  What I did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich,  but put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent  diff-metal1 contacts.  I forget exactly how wide the poly  lines were.  If I were doing this design again, I'd probably  omit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,  using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high  resistance it can be ignored at these speeds).  4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with  slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for  output signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.  I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for  a MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as I  needed.

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers) =====================================================================  I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?  1. Free options  The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.  Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will  be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86  is listed below.   X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was  done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).  It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.  There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,  X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you  don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).  X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).  2. Commercial options       1) Metro Link  2213 W.

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?  3. What is XFree86?     XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with    X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and    other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:      1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,        selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require        an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of        1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by        default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield        up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.     2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default        operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now        equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately        20% faster than X386 1.2.     3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,        or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4        with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from        SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.     4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.        Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about        the ATI and Trident drivers.     5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's        code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).     6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is        compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the        contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.     7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font        renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary        distributions.     8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.     9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA        cards is now included.     The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2    (they were not in XFree86 1.1):      1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of        available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200         (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).     2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the        monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \\\"two        headed\\\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only        been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).     3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.     4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to        consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for        more information.)     5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some         versions of these devices were not previously compatible).     6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor        timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous        documentation and a lot of experimentation).     7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including        implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many         vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more         information).     8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has        been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of        0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks        line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.     9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig        configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative        and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new        options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1)         manual page for more information on the format of this file).         Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file        in the source distribution for full details.     Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the    current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.  4. What OSs are supported?      XFree86 supports:  SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2  SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC  SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2  Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1   BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active  BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.   Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,  but anyone should feel free to submit patches.  If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to  xfree86@physics.su.oz.au  5. What video hardware is supported?     At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:   Tseng ET4000  Tseng ET3000  Paradise PVGA1  Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of   the PVGA1, and use its driver)  Genoa GVGA  Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000  ATI 18800, 28800   All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,  with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in  256 color mode.   The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of  video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the  ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome  server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.   It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to  non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To  avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86  1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel  clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are  discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how  these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such  a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with  future XFree86 releases.   If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,  it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the  Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not  work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.  In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond  products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions  of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).  If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.   Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA  video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the  CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It  could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset  on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot  of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested  theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not  working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86  working fine on them.  6. What about accelerated boards?   At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards  like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available  in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).   An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact  <hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.   A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>  or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.  7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?   The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the  16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory  contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-  planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each  of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-  buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled  16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code  could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).  But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer  implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,  but nothing is yet available from the project.  8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?   Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run  X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.  The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending  on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).  To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will  be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable   lower bound.  9. Where can I get source for XFree86?   Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22  from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:   export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)   ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)   ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)  (For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)   Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information  on which files you need to get to build your distribution.  10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?   Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from:   ftp.physics.su.oz.au  - SVR4 binaries    under /XFree86/SVR4   ftp.win.tue.nl   - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/XFree86/SVR4   ferkel.ucsb.edu   - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/SVR4/XFree86   stasi.bradley.edu  - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/XFree86/SVR4   blancmange.ma.utexas.edu - SVR3 (ISC) binaries    under /pub/ISC   ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries    under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86   tsx-11.mit.edu   - Linux binaries    under /pub/linux/packages/X11   agate.berkeley.edu  - 386BSD binaries    under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86   ftp.cs.uwm.edu   - Mach binaries    under /i386   Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may  archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will  contain a README file that describes what files you need to take  from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were  made when building the distribution.  IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?  11. Installation directories   The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot  (/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include  files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.   This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified  via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is  nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed  alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.  12. Configuration files   The XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\\\"Xconfig\\\") on startup.  The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in  the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.  13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes   David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known  clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.  The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and  is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is  also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on  export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated  occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the  settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to  David for inclusion in the database.   If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file   with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.  It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use  this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information  to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.   NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and        is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot        clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from        your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The        server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.        You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your        Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up        starting the server in the future.  14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit   If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to  reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is  fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.  V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?   First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).  15. SVR4  Why won't my xterm run properly?   If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define  CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.  csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'   The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping  problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be  installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.  16. SVR3   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.  17. 386BSD   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.   Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey  <Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the  file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:       agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2      wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2      grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2  18. Linux   You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc  jump libraries installed.   Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.   If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to  run the server as \\\"X -pn\\\". The default startup configuration assumes  that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files  /usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the  -pn argument to X386.   Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major  number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not  owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit  console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but  startx won't.   When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with  a tty, for example \\\"xdm < /dev/console &\\\".   For more detailed information, please read the file README present  with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.  19. Mach   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.  VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?   This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is  fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.  Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.  VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?  20. BSD compatibility library   A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.  The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a  which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),  seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include  <X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro  definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are  linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these  functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a  21. ANSICCOPTIONS   This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the  ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite  the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see  something like   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of   ANSICCOPTIONS=\\\"-ansi\\\"   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:   ANSICCOPTIONS=  to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death  with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because  CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must  add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.

Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically     reduces a woman's chances of getting vaginal candida, a yeast infection.   For the year-long study, researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical     Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recruited 13 women who suffered from  chronic yeast infections. For the first 6 months, the women each day ate 8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second  6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the     women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection  were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.      The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.   It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The    researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some     brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus          thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used   in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a          protective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to   try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists      acidophilus in its contents.                                             --- end ---                                                ===================================  InfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92   THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED   ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS   MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

Coll. of Physicians & Surgeons Complete Home            Medical Guide Edition 2 '89 p472(1)                               TEXT AVAILABLE  TEXT  COPYRIGHT Crown Publishers Inc. 1989                                       Candida (Monilia)                                                        This disease is usually caused by Candida albicans, a fungus that we   all carry at one time or another. In some circumstances, though, the     organisms proliferate, producing symptomatic infection of the mouth,     intestines, vagina, or skin. When the mouth or vagina are infected, the  disease is commonly called thrush.                                         Vaginitis caused by Candida often afflicts women on birth control      pills or antibiotics. There is itching and a white, cheesy discharge.    Among narcotic addicts, Candida infections can lead to heart valve       inflammation.                                                              Diagnosis of Candida infections is confirmed by cultures and blood     tests. Treatment can be with amphotericin B or orally with ketoconazole. There is no evidence that Candida in the intestine of normal individuals leads to disease. All people at one time or another have Candida in      their intestines. Claims for any benefit from special diets or chronic   antifungal agents is not based on any solid evidence.                    --- end ---    ========================== I hope this is informative.

Thanks,   Folkert Boonstra  \",\"Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part02 Last-modified: 1993/4/15   FAQ for sci.crypt, part 2: Net Etiquette  This is the second of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here? * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt? * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?   * What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?    Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always   make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.   You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same   newsgroup. After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the   readers want to see.  * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?    No. In fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were   created exactly so that political questions like ``Should RSA be   patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. Many   sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,   comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of   people who don't care about those other topics, try to put your   postings in the right group.    Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic   ``spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either.  * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?    ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here's some   ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a   doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.    If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some   ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by   random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the   opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is   distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some   systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts   and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but   this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most   sci.crypt readers won't bother with.    So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,   find out if it's really new. Look through this FAQ for references and   related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the   introductory textbooks.    When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at   large, try to break it yourself! You shouldn't waste the time of tens   of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily   answered on your own.    If you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some   reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your   system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to   sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated   in some areas.)    If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.   You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted   cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break   Snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. If you don't have enough   experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will   be able to find a flaw. If this happens, it's your responsibility to   consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more   layer of complication and come back for another round.    A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA   look at it. A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope   of this FAQ.\",\"Though I agree this is not the place to discuss guns, I note in passing that a number of gun apologists seem to have ignored the words \\\"well regulated\\\" in their distorted interpretations of the Second Amendment.

It remanded the case back to the trial court because the miller court didn't know if the weapon in question was a militia weapon.

In the United States, I generally read the NYT, and occasionally, a mainstream Israeli newpaper.   What you may not be taking into account is that the JP is no longer representative of the mainstream in Israel.  It was purchased a few years ago and in the battle for control, most of the liberal and left-wing reporters walked out.  The new owner stated in the past, more than once, that the JP's task should be geared towards explaining and promoting Israel's position, more than attacking the gov't (Likud at the time).  The paper that I would recommend reading, being middle stream and factual is \\\"Ha-Aretz\\\" - or at least this was the case two years ago.   And what about the \\\"Nat'l Enquirer\\\"? 8^) But seriously, if one were to read some of the leftist newspapers one could arrive at other conclusions.  The information you received was highly selective and extrapolating from it is a bad move. \",\"As I was created in the image of Gaea, therefore I must be the pinnacle of creation, She which Creates, She which Births, She which Continues.

My name is Elias Davidsson, Icelandic citizen, born in Palestine. My mother was thrown from Germany because she belonged to the 'undesirables' (at that times this group was defined as 'Jews'). She was forced to go to Palestine due to many  cynical factors. I have meanwhile settled in Iceland (30 years ago) and met many people who were thrown out from my homeland, Palestine, because of the same reason (they belonged to the 'indesirables'). These people include my neighbors in Jerusalem with the children of whom I played as child. Their crime: Theyare not Jews. My conscience does not accept such injustice, period. My work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism and racial discrimination. Those who protest against such practices in Arab countries have my support - as long as their protest is based on a principled position, but not as a tactic to deflect criticism from Israel. The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal.  The Center for Policy Research is a name I gave to those activities undertaken under my guidance in different domains, and which command the support of many volunteers in Iceland. It is however not a formal institution and works with minimal funds.  Professionally I am music teacher and composer. I have published  several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in Europe.  I would hope that discussion about Israel/Palestine be conducted in a more civilized manner. Calling names is not helpful.\",\"    And they work especially well when the Feds have cut off your utilities. -- \",\"I have the local bus card also, and don't have any such problems with it now, but this is the second card I've gotten - the first card didn't work in VGA mode correctly.

This is certainly   available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS.   A word of warning: make sure your kernel is configured to support shared   memory. And another word of warning: OpenWindows is slower than the MIT   server.

And she could bring ice cream with crushed dried chiltepins for dessert.    And we could see if there IS such a thing as an \\\"unrealistically large quantity\\\" of barbecue--the owner of the Moonlite estimates that the Owensboro restaurants serve a hundred thousand pounds of meat a week in the summer, and forty thousand in the winter--in a town of 50 000 or so.

You can only edit these four files. If you need to edit some other program's .ini file, use Notepad or some other ASCII editor.  I wonder whether Microsoft intended for sysedit to be used, or if it was just a holdover from the testing period and they forgot to take it out. The reason I think this is because there is absolutely no mention in the manuals about this program, and there is no online help for it (just an About entry under the File menu). The program looks like something that was intended for internal use only. It's kind of a shame, though. It would have made a nice multi-file replacement for Notepad.\",\"OK...

Velocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside of stock airboxes on a number of bikes.  At a tuned engine rpm, the stacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air rushing in. Air momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of the air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside long after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke. Shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from escaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion chambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing) to the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they design for shock waves.\",\" [KK] Bugunlerde \\\"jewish jokes\\\" muhabbetlerinden esinlenerek sunu [KK] yazayim dedim.

Brendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17 seconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals. Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good goaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the stretch to preserve the Blues lead.  The Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and taking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty on Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the blue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired a long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After the goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks 10-9 in the first period.  Jeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on the left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown collected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.  Two minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a short-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy Roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass across the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.  Noonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1. Stephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat Stephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan deflected the puck in the net.  Denny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the rebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for the shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards to Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues outshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.  With the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked up a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith was called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.  The Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into the two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot, and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and passed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp angle.  Just 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson Emerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with two Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the slot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.  The Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph made some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy Murray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game. The Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held on to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period, totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent in the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on on four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in the league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play.   The game was carried live on ABC, the first time an NHL game other than an All-Star game has been shown on network television since May 24, 1980, when CBS carried Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals.

The book is in two sections.  Section 1 contains a fairly reasonable analysis of the Bible, showing many inconsistencies between the Bible and modern science.  Well we all know that, no surprises.  Section 2 analyses the Koran's version of the Old Testament stories, and seems, on the face of it, to present a good case showing the Koran is consistent with modern science.  However, it was plain to me, that this consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the Koran.  Take the flood, for example, the bible is full of detail, (\\\"forty days and forty nights\\\", \\\"pair of every animal\\\", etc.), we all know this is nonsense.  The Koran's description of the same event is so obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as \\\"A big river  flooded for a few days and caused much damage\\\".  Yes, no contradiction but also not much fact.  The Koran might be consistent with modern science, but being consistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that time, does not seem much of an achievement.  The book concludes by saying something like, the Koran must have had divine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot of (to us now) ridiculous ideas about the universe, and none of them can be found in the Koran!  Arguing for the greatness of a book by talking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme.

As per request of Hasan:  From _The Revolt_, by Menachem Begin, Dell Publishing, NY, 1977:  [pp. 225-227]      \\\"Apart from the military aspect, there is a moral aspect to the story of Dir Yassin. At that village, whose name was publicized throughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had four killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the battle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women, children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the slopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw away the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own risk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent testimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable casualties.      \\\"The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].      \\\"In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr. Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal superciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of 'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'      \\\"The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the result it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel. Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the Haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting. Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main road; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the Haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the rest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even before they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir Yassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the conquest of Haifa.\\\"   [1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) \\\"To counteract the loss of Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish officials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of evil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at the mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen battalions to the forces of Israel.

A few weeks ago, she noticed that some of her hair was starting to fall out.  She would touch her head and strands of hair would just fall right out. (by the way, she is 29 or 30 years old).   It continued to occur until she had a bald spot about the size of a half dollar.  Since that time, she  has gotten two more bald spots of the same size.  Other symptoms she's described include:  several months of an irregular menstrual cycle (which is strange for her, because she has always been extremely regular); laryngitis every few days -- she will wake up one morning and have almost no voice, and then the next day it's fine; dizzy spells -- she claims that she's had 4 or 5 very bad dizzy spells early in the morning, including one that knocked her to the ground; and general fatigue.  She went to a dermatologist first who couldn't find any reason for the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspected thyroid problems.  He did the blood work and claims that everything came back normal.    She's very concerned and very confused.  Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions?  I told her that I thought she should see an endocrinologist.  Does that sound like the right idea?  ** By the way, in case you are going to ask...no, she has recently taken any medications that would cause these symptoms...no, she hasn't recently changed her hair products and she hasn't gotten a perm,  coloring, or other chemical process that might cause hair to fall out.\",\"there is a file out there (look for it with archie) that is called 'theref22.zip' which has lots of info on various PC things, amongst which is also a detailed description of all Floppy controller commands, I think hard drive controller commands are not there.  it is possible to read an entire track including all gaps, sector headers etc.   by setting sector size to something very large (like 8K).\",\"Storage space for sale:          Iomega 44 MB removeable HD for sale w/ 16 cartridges.

best way of self injection is to use the right size needle and choose the correct spot.

Clean the area with antiseptic before injection, and after. Make sure to inject deeply (a different kind of pain is felt when the needle enters the muscle - contrasted to the 'prick' when it  pierces the skin).\",\" Of your spelling, eh?

It emulates an HP 7570 or 7574 - I'm not sure which.  It has an option board on it that does the emulation.  It has a serial interface with Hardware handshake. I also have 340 Pens for it as follows:  10 packs of 4 Black Oil based, 16 packs of 4 Red,Green, Blue, and Black pens, 22 packs of 4 Aqueous Black, 7 packs of 4 Aqueous R,G,Blue,Black,  1 pack of 6 Aqueous Multi color pens,  and 114 assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored.      The plotter is used.  I have tested it using the Windows drivers for HP 7570 and HP 7574 and both worked fine.  It accepts either A or B sized paper. (8.5 x 11 or 11x17).      I figure that the plotter is worth about $300 and the pens are worth at least another $200 more..  One thing is certain, you won't need to purchase any pens for quite a while...  All of the packaged pens were sealed so they are all still fresh.  The rest were capped and seem to function as well.      I'd be willing to sell the pens seperate if anyone is interested in just them.      I'm selling it because I got a HP LaserJet and I don't need color.

Not much it seems.    It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about. If only those christian \\\"scientists\\\" would take note.  (In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian  scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics.  For example, there are a few chaps who are  trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed  light has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been  accounted for. :-] )   Or (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never  intended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one up?   Millions of people have \\\"died for a lie\\\".  This  point is difficult to  substantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments work in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed  themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.     That is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone) to become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to the claim that Jesus was the \\\"real thing\\\".    Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the point, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based  (I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with  his principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler was sane....      Hmmm.... I don't think his arguments warrant the use of a \\\"Therefore...\\\"   This is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or she will end up in all sorts of shit.     Tony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone,  who thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say \\\"a is equal to b because a is equal to b\\\".       That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed  in religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be correct.    It   I think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flames than here :-).  I have never really understood why the emotional sentiments of a stranger should be of interest to other people.   Someone famous said that there two evils in life, polititians and churchs, one rules by fear of the living, the other by fear of the dead.  If I am pressed I could probably find the exact quotation.\",\"  Let us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by sentence.   1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.  Origins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human species, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?  2) Science cannot explain origins.  This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends on what origins we are talking about.  3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science.  Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \\\"higher truth\\\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language of science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \\\"higher\\\" or  \\\"lower\\\"; they are simply true.  More to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science does not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the scope of discussion.  4) This is a false premise.  If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false then (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another false [or at least theologically unsound] statement.  5) By the way, I enjoy science.  On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read. However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy, perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.  6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.  Let us not quibble; count this one as true.  7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]  Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification:  \\\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\\\"  -----  It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his personal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.\",\"     Agressive actions are taken by both sides. Tough talk is done by both sides. When an arab leader is menacing to throw all jews in the water is also tough talk, I think. And killing people is mildly agressive (justified, in your opinion  if they are israeli soldiers, justified, in others' opinion if they are jews, not justified at all in others opinion).  When Brad wrote the article about 3 Israelis killed, ther was a lot of pride  and satisfaction in his lines. That's what I feel disgusting. We may agree  or not when a killing is 'technically' murder, but being enthousiastic about it?   And again, I may appreciate some of your points, but you are not objective. That is not a blame, just a remark. \",\" The FAN is an okay Sports Radio station, but doesn't come close to the ULTIMATE in Sports Radio, 610 WIP in Philadelphia.

This is a voluntary program, and thus harder for us to object to on the surface.  Their strategy is a business one rather than legal one.  They are pushing to get a standard in place, a secret standard, and if they get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market. It will be legal to sell better, untapable encryption that doesn't have registered keys, but it will be difficult, and thus not a plan for most phone companies.  You see, with clipper chip phones you'll be able to talk to any cellular company, or other phones or ports because they will follow the standard.  AT&T has already announced a clipper chip encryption product.  The government has marketed hard to get major vendors to use these chips.   If they get enough market share, they will rule.  And thus there will be very little market for systems that can't be tapped by the police.  The public isn't that concerned about it now, after all.  They freely do calls that anybody with an old TV can listen to today!  They won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure them only from the police.  Well, some people will buy these phones, but they will only work with other proprietary phones, so the market will be small and the phones expensive.  Unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them cheap, only the Mob will buy them.  And this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists of better encryption phones, because \\\"the only reason a person would want one is to evade the police.\\\"  Interesting.\",\"thus  Curiously, in modern PostScript, the point in a polygon problem can be solved even more easily.

SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it. There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and the software.  THAT IS IT. Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.  SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}  asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}  synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a  rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}  SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from  SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs  this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers  AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the   slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode   4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous  mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}  SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things  over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the  machine and the external device.  Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver  software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.  Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.  SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this  requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING  devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.

Crohn's has no dietary restriction in general.   The feeling obout this has changed in the GI community.  The current feeling is that inflammation is not induced by food.  There is even evidence that patients deprived of food have mucosal atrophy due to lack of stimulation of intestinal growth factors.  There is now interest in providing small amounts of nasogastric feeding to patients on IV nutrition.  But I digress.   Symptoms can be drastically enhanced by food, but not inflammation.   The low residue diet is appropriate for you if you still have obstructions. Again, it is not felt that food causes inflammation.  These foods are avoided because they may get stuck.  I'd go ahead and have the fudge, though ;-)  .  Spencer makes an especially good point in having an observant and informed patient.  Would that many patients be able to tell what causes them problems.  The digestive processing idea is changing, but if a food causes problems, avoid them.  Be sure that the foods are  tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.  Crohn's commonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with severly restricted diets that take months to renormalize.  There was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussed the issue of dietary restriction of fiber.  It would be worth reading to anyone with an interest in Crohn's.

The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers to look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was mint.     As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k miles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800. There is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.

Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specifically the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats) will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user, and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed.  Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate with impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from key escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means.  Because life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal very large and conspicuous property (luxury cars), it is reasonable to assume that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous property (a cipher cellular phone).  Just as we have seen in the past with \\\"blue box\\\" technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones, we can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakes criminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stolen instruments.  Because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days, a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.  There will be a continuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies.  In other words, Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, and persistent threat to the general public.  On the other hand, if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a device in a mostly non-ciphered network, the communication will at least stand out as being unusual, and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation.  Finally, because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments, there will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communications in the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is discovered, and the instruments involved have been identified).  While recording and archiving may not be feasible for wireline networks, it is probably feasible across the more limited bandwidth of radio networks.

There isn't much time, however.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible to dying from bacterial meningitis.

I suspect that NSA has put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs, probably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the existence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say) a DES keysearch machine.      As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination could acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since it would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked jodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency or organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak- nesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for (say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the complaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars to build a keysearch machine for.)      How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of the GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?  How about home phones of major execs and important engineers and designers? \\\"Gee, Mr Jones, I understand you've had some financial problems lately. Maybe I can help...\\\"        Indeed, if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likely as secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However, the system as a whole isn't resistant to \\\"practical cryptanalysis.\\\"  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes how several NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despite security measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.  And NSA confidential data was *not* subject to being requested by thousands of police organizations and courts across the land.\",\"My friend, David Gordon wants to sell his 1989 Honda.

The Olivetti Quaderno, for example [*great* 1kg subnotebook/palmtop PC -- sorry for the plug, folks, but Olivetti don't seem to be doing a good job marketing it themselves :-)] includes sound digitisation hardware; they provide vocoders for their DSP which produce varous bit-rates. There's one which gives pretty acceptable voice quality at 13Kbit/sec, just right for a V.32bis modem.  Their DSP can play and record at the same time, too -- so you wouldn't need to play \\\"two-way-radio\\\". You can also download code to the DSP subunit, though you'd need a software development kit for the DSP in  question [dunno which it is...] if you wanted to produce your own  vocoder for, say, V.32 speeds.

The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I   can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same   application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application   that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I   need to re-boot.  Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I   first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many   GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows   (with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge   machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into   the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into   the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I   was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother   board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from   SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized   fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.  The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes   rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves   the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't.   I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said   these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire   day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's   in the sppace of 20 minutes?  What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good   diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software   problem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After   Dark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or   gdi.exe.

This is how the history  between the two nations started some centuries ago.  Since then, it has been  a continuous battle between the two nations.  From my perspective I can't see  why I should say that Greeks have been responsible for what has happened   between the two nations.  Of course, it would not be reasonable to argue that  the hostility should drag till we kick the Turks out of this area.  This isn't  going to happen, so the best would be to improve the relations between the two  countries.  A golden oportunity exists with Cyprus.  If things can't work  there, there isn't any possible way that could work between our nations.    I always avoid to discuss such things.  I consider it a waist of my time.  Besides, as I said, I do not want to open a new flame.    I thought it was a smart move to receive more money from Greek tourists.  I bet that this week there should be about 200,000 tourists from Greece  in Turkey.  Each one will leave at least $1,000 so go and figure what this  means to your economy.  If you had kept the visa requirement, how many  Greeks would bother to visit Turkey?    Come on. Do not extrapolate from your limited personal experience.

  Actually, what I think has become more evident, is that you are determined to   flaunt your ignorance at all cost.

Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty   plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.    Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice   time per game and some measure of its \\\"quality\\\" (i.e., is the player put out   in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up   against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would   much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious   merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.

Earlier, I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs.  One guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well, I saw one think that someone said about \\\"Show me a team that used Split- fires....\\\"  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.  Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and increased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires increased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing on horsepower numbers.  Now how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that depends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine? In the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque, but 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low. So for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.  But what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins, but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for the hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However, twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this translate?  Increased torque should \\\"theoretically\\\" help twins make more power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods or anything made, just stick 'em in.  Now I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with somebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than 4's.          As far as racing teams....  Ducati team \\\"Fast by Ferraci\\\" used splitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James running for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then. Also, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....  Peace.  Warren wcd82671@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu \\\"Have Suzuki, will travel...\\\"  At a local \\\"fix-er-up-er\\\" shop, the bike repairest looked at a dumped ZX-7.  Then he asked the guy...  \\\"What happened...\\\"   \\\"I dumped the clutch...\\\" \\\"How fast...\\\"        \\\"Pretty fast...\\\" \\\"Insurance...\\\"       \\\"Nope.\\\"  The fixer smiled.....\",\"Just curious if anyone has started to standout early in the season in the BB DDD this year. I expect the Phillies staff, while getting the wins, would have to rank up there. Luis Gonzalez and Derrick May are among the early league leaders, and all 6 of their bombs have come at the Phils' expense.

You may wish to ask IBM whether they support this. --\",\"  I don't know, but I'm as willing to speculate as anyone.  Several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography. Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other algorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something like DES) for the encryption.  How could the \\\"back door\\\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few possibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door keys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers used in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.  Another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips simply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own internal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys usable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's secret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be identical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most straightforward to me.)  Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the message itself has a \\\"dual key\\\" property, that possession of either of two keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from the DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.  It's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and December was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would participate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early knowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with Clipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.\",\"========================= =Car Audio System Items:= =========================  Sony XR-7070 Head Unit (Radio): Pullout ============================== 20 W x 4 max.

During the second  Imlach era, when Darryl Sittler was called a \\\"cancer on the team\\\", he tore the C off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain.  Sittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly captaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittler's friend) Bobby Clarke.  Instead, Sittler got traded to Detroit.  Rick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and they took the captaincy away from him.  Then he was traded to Chicago.  During Doug Carpenter's tenure as Leaf coach, in an  attempt  to  kiss the  ass of a sulking Gary Leeman, the Leafs took the A away from Brad Marsh to give to Leeman.  Leeman wouldn't take it and when they  tried to give it back to Marsh, he wouldn't take it neither.  The best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman, late of the Senators.  While he was in Philadelphia, Bobby Clarke, arguably one of the great captains of all time, was bumped up to the status  of playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy.  Bridgman be- came the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a captain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the players.  The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of  making sure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full.   -- \",\"I'm the keeper of the stats for a family hockey pool and I'm looking for daily/weekly email servers for playoff stats.

Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois. ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.  The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king, who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which  the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million, His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual, seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of slots.  The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions supporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from  70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside). According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and  the Pacific Rim.   RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money. Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began  negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in  Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time. Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way that people operate.  For example \\\"everybody can sell you everything.\\\"   Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.  Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who  went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually, he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the  Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to  allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.  The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied  Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in  Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners :-)  Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is  apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them  specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1 million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their  satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They  have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place now.  Tidbits:  *  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big business because big business is just like what they have over there, except that \\\"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\\\"  *  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months.  *  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia, and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.  *  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried partly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying monolith.  Italy gets a new government \\\"every two weeks\\\" but we don't worry  because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.  *  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting 25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \\\"equivalent\\\" value in  rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government.  *  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western  satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites, which was rather reassuring.  *  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much  shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the  difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition, shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date hardware. \",\":         Goodbye Minnesota,...you never earned the right to have an NHL  : franchise in the first place! :         Hope you enjoy your Twin city wide mania for HIGH SCHOOL HOCKEY : (hey, by the way my old pee wee team is having a reunion in Regina, care  : to come up and film the event?) :         Yee haa Golden Gophers : Whatta weird town!!!!!  : s4lawren@sms.business.uwo.ca (Stephen Lawrence) : Western Business School  --  London, Ontario  This is the second posting of this kind from an idiot at a business  school in Canada.

I didn't suggest that all  government regulations be subject to referenda.  So I don't follow the  comments above.   I mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equally undesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to draw support among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate.  Furthermore, I am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in an industrial society because the weight of litigation and/or misery it would produce would effectively crush productive effort.  No, I'm not surprised.  I just think it's interesting that on one hand libertarians assume a limited government can be decreed, yet on the other posit an entire government made up of people who carry guns.  (I realize that many libertarians assume that such a government will be  counterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry, but it is worth noting that widespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent the establishment of totalitarian government, e.g. Iraq.)  Yup, sure do.  But since I also support the constitutional requirement that the government provide for the general welfare (Article I section 8), I'm willing to justify such programs on that basis.

I've been thinking about this, and if this chip/scheme is to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange, either using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme like Diffie-Hellman.  If there's an out-of-band transmission of a shared session key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping?  If the phone company or some other online central authority generates a session key and sends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble of having some complicated key-depositories?  Just ask the phone company for a copy of the session key for each call.      Now, it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of every public key used by anyone anywhere, right?  So, probably, there will be some way of getting these keys verified.  This might be a digitally- signed (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit, stored by this unit.  It might also be an online directory with access to everyone's public keys.  (This would introduce another weakness to the security of the scheme, of course.)  Presumably, if you don't use your designated key, you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips.      It might be useful to have a modified chip, which would allow you to use either the original public/private key pair, or some other key pair and verification scheme.

Over the period of thousands of years, various people come up and testify of their experience with the living God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses, once the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comes David, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King  Nebuchanezzar.

Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use to kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Up comes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself. Up comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRS agents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of years with people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself \\\"I am.\\\"   While you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that King David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known Matthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these people are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet all of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tells of his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience is different, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly reveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God. What Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of Babylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a different perspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony dares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness's testimony, even though different from those prior, consistently describes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.    Now.

Max altitude seemed to be on the order of 50 m, but that is hard  to judge.\",\"     I think that you are incorrect, Roger.  Patrick, Smythe and Adams all played or coached in the league before becoming front office types.  Hence, they did help build the league, although they were not great players themselves.     I agree that a name is a name is a name, and if some people have trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans, then changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like a reasonable idea.  If we can get people in the (arena) door by being uncomplicated, then let's do so.  Once we have them, they will realize what a great game hockey is, and we can then teach them something abotu the history of the game.       No, I would not want to see a Ballard division.  But to say that these owners are assholes, hence all NHL management people are assholes would be fallacious.  Conn Smythe, for example, was a classy individual (from what I have heard).    Also, isn't the point of \\\"professional\\\" hockey to make money for all those involved, which would include the players.  What I think you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as should have been their due, and it is the players that are what make the game great not the people who put them on the ice, so naming division after management people rather than players is adding insult (in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was deserved).   \",\"(Robert L. McMillin) rants:  And how did the \\\"free love advocates of the 1960's\\\" manage to perform this demolition--forced breeding programs or something?   Now let me get this straight.  After a nice, long rant about how people need to take personal responsibility for their economic and social lives, all of a sudden 1960's radicals (such as me, I guess) are responsible for poor people's lifestyles?  Tell me how that works--or do you think that poor people are just too dumb to think for themselves?

Just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing. You refer to      differing interpretations of \\\"create,\\\" and say that many Christians may      not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith      on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is      truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.       Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created      and eternally existent are equivalent, you say \\\"granted the Mormon      belief...\\\" You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to      have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address      and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the      conclusion that you grant.       The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus      is the creator of all.

The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is      nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible      says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:            The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the            kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];           (Matthew 13:38)            I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which            ye have seen with your father. (John 8:38)            Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not            born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.  Jesus said            unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I            proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he            sent me.

He was a murderer from the            beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in            him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a            liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)            And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of            the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease            to pervert the right ways of the Lord?

(1 John 3:10)       One becomes a child of God...            But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the           sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)            Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that           we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us           not, because it knew him not.  Beloved, now are we the sons of God,           and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when           he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he           is. (1 John 3:1-2)       ...when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ:            Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of           the will of man, but of God. (John 1:13)            Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus           Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,           (Ephesians 1:5)            Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should           be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.

The fact that some groups try to read       something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches. For       example, the fact that the Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ       does not alter what the Bible teaches [ \\\"Looking for that blessed hope,      and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus      Christ;\\\" (Titus 2:13),\\\"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus      Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through      the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:\\\" (2 Peter 1:1)]       on the Deity of Christ.       We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not       even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that       have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches,       you have to look at the Bible.  ra> >     \\\"Our Lord's mortality was essential to his own salvation\\\" (_The ra> >     Promised Messiah_, p. 456), \\\"He had to work out his own salvation by ra> >     doing the will of the Father in all things\\\" (ibid., p.54), \\\"he had ra> >     to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom\\\" (_Mormon ra> >     Doctrine_, p.71). ra> ra>    Welcome to the wonderful world of Mormon paradoctrine, Robert.

The curious part is that no one addressed the      issue of `Jesus needing to be saved.' Rick comes the closest with his \\\"I      have my own conclusions\\\" to addressing the point.       Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of      Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't      think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the      issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this      subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may       certainly be. \",\"Went to the Dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night.   Astacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night. In the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then a single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the throw home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.   Lasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza batting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder and Webster.   Piazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards. The Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single by Offerman.   By the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but the score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive plays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner trying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who had strayed a bit from first base, etc.   Karros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into the outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going through, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw to third and EASILY got the runner at third.   My heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.   Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game with the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.   Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3 innings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning game had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh given his light work out Tuesday.   Gross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit to the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted in a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it 3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next thing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on first was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had scored long before that.   Meanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning. Lee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros and Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?). Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but that was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his third straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my free Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this up all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year honors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs of a sophomore jinx year.   The final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits. Dodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.\",\"Oops!  I came across this file from last year.  Thought you might enjoy some of these thoughts.  The predictions were made on the date indicated.  They are largely out of order.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  June 11, 1992 tedward@cs.cornell.edu (ME!)   You all know how things turned out.  The Orioles, Red Sox, and Yankees all disappeared.  The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the expected pace.  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half.  The Rangers predictably took a dive.  That shouldn't have surprised anybody.  Meanwhile, as predicted, the Mariners dropped behind the Angels and Royals.  They clearly didn't deserve the 22-33 record in June.  The White Sox and A's upped their game a bit, while the Twins dropped off a little.  But for the most part things were as expected.  Okay, so there were a few blatant errors.  But for a predictive calculation, I thought this did pretty well. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  From CAVGEOE@YaleVM.YCC.Yale.Edu Tue Mar 31 16:36:34 1992  Hm.

Tsk Tsk.  Not nice to predict something like this.   You got that right!  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  And my response...   Okay, so the Mets finished fifth.  But I got the Pirates and Expos right!   First half?  Dead on!  Second half?  Ummm....  I'm a Sox fan, go easy on me!   So I got my predictions for Gooden and Saberhagen reversed.  :-)  I was at least *close*, and was right about Jefferies.  (Though I don't know.  HAS WFAN criticized the Jefferies trade?)   Close.  No cigar.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Some predictions need no introduction!  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Sometimes us statheads get lucky.  Grace *didn't* hit behind Dawson the entire season, but he also finished with only 79 RBIs.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Nope.  He slowed down, and the injury finished him off.  Didn't even reach 50.  But a ballsy prediction, nonetheless.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  From ECAXRON@MARS.LERC.NASA.GOV Thu May 21 16:42:21 1992  The Orioles finished seven games out.  None of them won 20 (though Mussina might have had a chance, with better relief and more starts).   Except for the Brewers (who you probably forgot), you were right!  The rest of the division was thoroughly mediocre.  The Yankees and Indians \\\"led\\\" with 76 wins, the Red Sox \\\"trailed\\\" with 73 wins.

Maddux surprised all.   I don't think I want to wait that long.  But they won 89 games last year, and they were fifth in the league in ERA.  Not a bad start.   Looks like it.  He wasn't bad last year, just too consistent to be an ace.  So far this year looks like more of the same.   I honestly can't say.  Did they get rid of him?  Their BB totals were down last year.

It is about drug resistant microorganisms & the history of antibiotics.

I've had the experience of going quickly from believing that I shouldn't  date non-Christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to  believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each  other.  When the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to  their original state.    This is an especially extreme case because I was young and away from home  and fellowship.  I don't think it would work exactly this way for most  people.  However, it's important not to underestimate the power of  feelings of attraction.  \",\"  Aw, just take a moment to digest it and I'm sure you'll see the humour...\",\"Hello,  I just canceled my support of the Cable Regime and I would like to at least pick up the 3 networks and NBC.  :)   I do not have tons of money nor even a few pounds so what I am looking for is the best solution for reception for under 100 dollars.

Sure -- only 3.8 years for each solution.     But there is a MUCH more pernicious problem with the scheme as proposed.  Building a brute force machine to test 2^40 possible keys if you have the other half from one escrow agent is EASY.  (One chip, one test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks, and that break gives you all messages involving that phone.)     The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives you nothing is an improvement, but notice that XORing with (truely random) bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents.  Using + for XOR, SK for the escrowed key, and A and B for two random bit strings, hand SK+A+B, SK+A, and SK+B to three escrow agents.  It is possible to come with an encoding scheme to match any escrow pattern, for example 3 of 4, such that fewer cooperating escrow agents gives the cracking agency no benefit.  --       Robert I. Eachus\",\"  The problem you see here is that some Christians claim things about the Bible which they don't actually believe or practice. I've known all sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to the fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the  conservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is a (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I don't know of anyone who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition. While I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official position of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).  The particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in terms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact  that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane  and give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this  (other passages as well) aren't directly applicable today would  show them that what they claim about the Bible and what they  actually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens't.  While this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians, I would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this case, making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actually put into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and look at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying to express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the Christian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as \\\"Word of God\\\", \\\"inerrant\\\", \\\"infallibale\\\", \\\"The Manufacturer's Handbook\\\", \\\"The only rule of faith and practice in the church today\\\" to describe the Bible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at the mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably false and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are generally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even when the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical example is from the garden of Eden where God asks \\\"Where are you?\\\" and Adam explains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had answered God's words he would have said something like \\\"I'm here in this tree.\\\" The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these words are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people have not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of the place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases and explanations that others use.  I hope this helps. --                                                                      ___ Bill Rea                                                            (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---\",\" Like it or not, Edward, Anwar has a very good, valid point.

Since there has been some speculation on this news group about my own involvement in this project, I'd like to add that I was not in any way involved.  I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on Thursday evening, April 15.  Since then I have spent considerable time talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and I attended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16.   The document below is the result of that effort.   Dorothy Denning ---------------                       THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                 Dorothy Denning                                  April 19, 1993   INTRODUCTION  On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key.   CHIP STRUCTURE  The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is 16 Mbits a second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip   ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with the device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can be used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    The law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.   CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW  All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer information facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at Mikotronx.  At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a 64-bit block R1:          R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .  Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:            R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]          R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .  R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies.  As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips. After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind.   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2, and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies.  The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or both may be independent from the government.   LAW ENFORCEMENT USE  When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with Clipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the family key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take a warrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow agents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K. Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder operated by the FBI. \",\"I have a set of four 235-60-R14 Big O tires that I had on my 1988 Thunder  Bird.

The structure  of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but  fighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have  comfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't really have the former,  in the long term, unless you have the latter.  One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird  cross between a libertarian and an \\\"establishment tool\\\" is that I end up  taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when  the government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my  lifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.    As a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government  to be \\\"fair\\\".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed,  whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the  government would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem.   What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal,  so much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong)  sense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth  it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its  citizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the  major architects of the American system of government, figured that in a  couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it  would be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.  I  agree, and while I don't go around trying to spark one, I'll certainly  participate if it happens when I'm around.  There is a reason I am such a  strong supporter of individual rights while being so cynical about politics.   I've already written off politics.  And yes, this may get me in trouble some day.  If so, so be it.  I drive  faster than 55 MPH, too. \",\"Any clue? Some times when I enter Win 3.1 ProgMan says that I need to rebuild a group!

They had died as the helpless must, with  their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself.\\\"   Serdar Argic\",\" It's always possible, but if this is the case, I think that there is some blatant discrimination going on here.

Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian players.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners can do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable here in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US that the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their import ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.  Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would make players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the lower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some that play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm club, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on the secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian players in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.)) So with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players in North America.   I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the world.

The older models are VERY well built. Unless Toyota lost its mind, I would assume, until  proven otherwise, that the newer models have inherited some if not all of the qualities of their ancestors.  Two major differences in the running gear (that I'm aware of) need study. My '79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have independant front suspension. The solid axle is theoretically stronger and more reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The independant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy the typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. I'm not sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive system.

I think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court. Currently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones, record calls without listening to them, and then post-facto obtain warrants and listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But this strategy wouldn't get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not in the near term.)  In other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence inadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to interpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I'd be surprised that archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything but analogous to a wiretap by the courts.  Note that that doesn't mean I think it won't be done if technically feasible.  Just as I'm sure many wiretaps are done now without warrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future, start surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause, decrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation gets a boost from data that, sadly, won't ever be presented to a jury.  While I'm posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this archiving scenario to extremes, read \\\"Lacey and his Friends\\\", a collection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the slippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don't worry folks, it's stored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can get to it.  And by the way, we'll be installing cameras on all major streets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and teller machines, don't we?  And then we'll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public places.  Then in some private places.  Then we'll make it a crime ever to be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy cubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and after.  But, see, there's still a right to privacy.  We haven't curtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it'd be to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a VR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.

The 27th was a short day at work, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided to go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes behind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24 Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the  car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit, and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and  her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to  45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help them. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?  When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was,  but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the  Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle around it. I ask, \\\"What's going on?\\\" Someone tells me, \\\"Come listen.\\\" Well they were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \\\"Brother Muslims, our time has come . . . \\\" and something else along that line. I didn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to  get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter.  New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And the comments started: \\\"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"There's no need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\\\" I even heard that: \\\"All  Moscow is behind us.\\\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this  was no joke. I quietly left and went home.  Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh,  that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of  things, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.  My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku.  I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and  shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly, like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a  demonstration and move slowly.  My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd people are shouting \\\"Down with the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"Death to the Armenians!\\\" I waited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street  on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned  and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26  Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there  was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same  kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside  from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.  My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of uneasy and said, \\\"No, let's stay at home instead.\\\" An hour went by, or maybe  an hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say exactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on the side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.  I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside, and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time  there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more  aggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration. They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run  again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I  followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was  leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one  side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square  and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There  was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals. I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \\\"We don't need  perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\\\" Now what did they  mean by \\\"living like we have been?\\\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else.  But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense  of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just  in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it  anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.  Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians'  apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't  hear them say \\\"kill them\\\" over the microphone, I only heard \\\"beat them and  drive them out.\\\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then another are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and  I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB. There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try  to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.  Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no demonstration, and I had to protect my family.  I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next to the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai- lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some- thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City  Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I  saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the  cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15  to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried  off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe  about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha.  When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was  about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He  has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I  have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of  people smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled  around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.  Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting.  I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am,  I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags.  And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the  street. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag,  which had \\\"Ermeni oryum\\\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \\\"Death to  Armenians!\\\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really know what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is Rafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark blue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His  family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on  Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars;  their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the  left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a  new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son  was carrying a flag that said \\\"Death to Armenians!\\\" I was surprised because  before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being  done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.  Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \\\"It's OK, it'll pass,  they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up.\\\" Naturally I didn't  want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And  this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't  see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't  handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking  and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and  hashish to put in a store window!  So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one  would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again,  the police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't  breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time.  True, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much- vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people  died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I  couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be  specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of  Sumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.  When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \\\"Let's go upstairs.\\\"  We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the  evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more. I stopped at \\\"The Corner,\\\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I  look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to  the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old.  The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed  toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person,  wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as  though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more  noise, and the glass was flying again.  We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor, there was really no way to defend yourself there.  In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town.  On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or  what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the  bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying  there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing you couldn't even see him.  That was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.

My observations over the past 30 years (and not withstanding a little history reading beside) is that while religious differences do play a part in many of the conflicts, so does (unfortunately) race, economics and any other items that identify one group of men as being different from another.  If we want to couch the cause of conflict in Christian terms, I would put it while Christ died for our sins, we are yet sinners. While some individuals assume \\\"Christlike\\\" natures, most of us do not even come close.  I realize that in many ways this is a trite answer, but I guess that it is my way of rationalizing man's constant (or so it seems) conflict.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------\",\"Finally, an objective source.

Some people do not think about it at all and merely follow their impulses. I claim that is just as dangerous as \\\"following authority\\\". I could site sexually transmitted diseases, drug abuse, all manner of criminal activity, the savings and loan scandal, car accidents, eggs thrown at my house, all are examples of people not \\\"following authority\\\". I could easily argue that in the evil examples you gave the  problem was a leader not following _his_ authority and doing what  he wanted. Of course, where is the top of the chain? Therein lies  our search.    I don't think it's as simple as you are claiming. \\\"Pressing need\\\" is ambiguous. Should I recycle or not?    Realize that I have four kids who, despite being very precocious  of course, are very tiring with their constant lack of understanding the tremendous knowledge I wish to impart to them.   Ahh! An ironic ending.   The irony I was implying in my initial pithy retort to the bumper  sticker cliche \\\"Question Authority\\\" was that I was questioning  the authority of the person telling me to question authority. It seems there is a certain segment of society that finds meaning only in being different, only in rebelling, forsaking everything for the sake of freedom. I question their integrity and fortitude.  There is another freedom that comes from doing a task correctly. Different people are at different levels of development in different areas. Part of the challenge of life is to find the right authorities to follow, we can't know everything about everything. Often  when learning a new skill or subject I will follow the teacher, perhaps blindly. Only when I have learned enough to ask appropriate questions should I question him, only when I have developed my skills enough should I challenge him. Once again, how do I know when I get to those stages?  If you have to be told to question authority, perhaps you shouldn't.\",\" : >EVER HEAR OF : >BAPTISM AT BIRTH?

Otherwise, the key  management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system  unworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place at the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in  their data base?  This means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key  algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is  rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the feds are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that  could break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.     As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to ban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. Their contention that they  need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likely is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont  have the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q&A session, they talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed. They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without  court order even though tapping a phone line requires one. Also pick up on  their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we'll ban strong crypto outright? I dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all (legal) ways possible.\",\"-> First I want to start right out and say that I'm a Christian.  It  ->makes sense to be one.  Have any of you read Tony Campollo's book- liar,  ->lunatic, or the real thing?  (I might be a little off on the title, but he  ->writes the book.  Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity,  ->in the process he became a Christian himself.  Sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy.  Just what organization did he  belong to? Does it have a name?  -> The book says that Jesus was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a  ->modern day Koresh) or he was actually who he said he was.  Logic alert - artificial trifercation.  The are many other possible explainations.  Could have been that he never existed.  There have been some good points made in this group that is not  impossible  that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths, Mithra comes to mind.  -> Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.  Who would  ->die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People  ->gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing  ->someone who was or had been healed.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did  ->heal people.     Logic alert -  argument from incredulity.  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn't mean that it isn't true.  Liars can be very pursuasive, just look at Koresh that you yourself site. He has followers that don't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die. By not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what  he believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more  that faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling, so the stories got bigger to appeal better.  -> Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn  ->to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example  ->anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see  ->this right away. -> Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the  ->real thing.     Or might not have existed, or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, because in the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are  possible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives.  However, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the  incomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at  least one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one of the other two alternative is no longer valid.  -> Some other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in  ->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal  ->and Crucifixion.  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I  ->write I will use it.  JC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn't be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.  What would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then,  yet  fullfilled them anyway.  -> I don't think most people understand what a Christian is.  It  ->is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.  Rather I think it  ->should be a way of life, and a total sacrafice of everything for God's  ->sake.  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the  ->same.  Hey we can't do it, God himself inspires us to turn our lives  ->over to him.  That's tuff and most people don't want to do it, to be a  ->real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at.  But  ->just like weight lifting or guitar playing, drums, whatever it takes  ->time.  We don't rush it in one day, Christianity is your whole life.   ->It is not going to church once a week, or helping poor people once in  ->a while.  We box everything into time units.  Such as work at this  ->time, sports, Tv, social life.  God is above these boxes and should be  ->carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for  ->ourselves.    Here I agree with you.  Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says  seriously, and what it says is that it must be a total way of life.  I have very little respect for  Xians that don't.  If the myth is true, then it is true in its entirity.  The picking and choosing that I see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Note the material under the headings   and   Of course, as they said -- \\\"Local codes may vary\\\".    I'm not sure about this.  If the ground connections on the outlets are connected to anything, they should be connected to a wire that runs back to the main panel, where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house ground rod.  A connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one of the goals of the ground wire, which is that if a short develops from hot to the ground wire, enough current would flow to trip the breaker.    Hmmm.  How are those orange \\\"isolated ground\\\" outlets (often used in computer rooms) wired?  \",\"I am auctioning off the following comics.

Coming from you it is  a definition, not an assertion:     Islam is good.  Belief in Islam is good.  Therefore, being a     believer in Islam can produce only good...because Islam is    good. Blah blah blah.  That's about as circular as it gets, and equally meaningless.  To say that something produces only good because it is only good that  it produces is nothing more than an unapplied definition.  And all you're application is saying that it's true if you really  believe it's true.  That's silly.  Conversely, you say off-handedly that _anything_ can happen under atheism.  Again, just an offshoot of believe-it-and-it-becomes-true- don't-believe-it-and-it-doesn't.    Like other religions I'm aquainted with, Islam teaches exclusion and caste, and suggests harsh penalties for _behaviors_ that have no logical call for punishment (certain limits on speech and sex, for example).  To me this is not good.  I see much pain and suffering without any justification, except for the _waving of the hand_ of some inaccessible god.  By the by, you toss around the word knowledgable a bit carelessly. For what is a _knowledgeable believer_ except a contradiction of terms.  I infer that you mean believer in terms of having faith. And If you need knowledge to believe then faith has nothing to do with it, does it?\",\"  Still living in an alternate universe? Numerous articles in major newspapers  (London Times) and periodicals (Newsweek) during the war, had suggested  the existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the  Nazis. Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to  deal with this issue extensively. Derounian's motives were twofold: his  deeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt  obliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history. Concurrently, Derounian embarked on what one would call 'crisis control'  or face-saving. In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger  Armenian community in the United States, he marginalized collaboration  as deplorable but insignificant.[1]  [1] John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), 'The Plotters,'     E. P. Dutton & Company, Inc., New York 1946, p. 182.    Source: \\\"Mitteilungsblatt, Berlin, December 1939, Nr. 2 and 5-6\\\"   Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately   forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi   collaboration.   A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft  is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The   magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany  and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the  magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,  is attention-getting.   This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically  important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be  an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.    In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain  political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They   occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.  The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered   \\\"Aryan\\\" and what befell them.  Now wait, there is more.  Source: \\\"From Sardarapat to Sevres and Lausanne\\\" by Avetis Aharonian.

If those teams were a 'sure thing' and lost,  then it's probably not so unreasonable for someone to pick another  team (not that I did).\",\"Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of approx. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better off if an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more fuel to the flame!  1)  Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though Lopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was still recovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe), and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.  I was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez can hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was the Braves \\\"Defensive Catcher\\\" prospect, while Brian Deak was the Braves \\\"Offensive Catcher\\\" prospect.  Besides, Olson and Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard box, and don't walk enough to be useful.  But Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went with the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.  2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around. After all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher (California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to move Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work. Plus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't tiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill at $450,000, but that's only what I recall).  3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to play in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players aren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster the longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change, but the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business standpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the first time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.  4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team. I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves, and the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field, which, IMO, includes Lopez.  Of course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)  As for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went like this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's) (the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)  Cox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a little smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding is better than it used to be.  Schuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion just won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count on him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the defense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on Billy Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs, we can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to give us some pitching depth in 1995.  Cox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign. OK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having Berry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about Klesko?  Schuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil for Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money or Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell, but somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First Jeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he gets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he and Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!  Cox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading deadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few extra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California... if Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid. And if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees could be \\\"persuaded\\\" to act up.  There's always the 15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Schuerholz:  What about Caraballo?  Cox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts in Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be arbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks.  Schuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.  Cox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson would recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into running into him again?  Schuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get $3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one extra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little bit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed hitter.  You know how rare that is?  Cox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common, if you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in the World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!  Schuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez into the lineup.  Cox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff Reardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used to our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with them this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?  Schuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep will be hurt by May.  Cox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely one of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I can call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant! THE WORLD SERIES!  I'll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey Stengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto, but have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I'll finally get my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!  Schuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those \\\"happy pills\\\" left around by Chuck Tanner?  Why'd you ever hire that guy anyhow?

Well, my group's plan is to market a \\\"full page\\\" monitor for laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed by authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook screen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember, technical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR \\\"full\\\" height.  The screen would probably be monochrome. The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document.

GR>     You see Ron, the point isn't whether YOU and your patients are GR>  convinced that whatever it is you do works; it's whether what you do is GR>  MORE effective in similar cases (of whatever it is you think you are GR>  treating) than cupping, bloodletting, and placebo.   This is very interesting. I have come exactly to the same conclusions  but in regards to *conventional* medicine.   You see, I don't just treat little old ladies that wouldn't know any  different of what is being done, but a bulk of my patients consist of  teachers, lawyers, judges, nurses, accountants, university graduates,  and various health practitioners.  If these people have gotten results with my method after having been  unsuccessful with yours or their own, I certainly wouldn't lose any   sleep over whether you or your peers approve of my treatments ---   let's face it, with all the blunders committed by \\\"scientific\\\" MDs   over the years, I know a lot of people who hold your *scientific*   method in much lower esteem than they hold mine!  GR>  As far as we know ayurveda = crystals = homeopathy = Ron Roth GR>  which may all equal placebo administered with appropriate GR>  trappings...         Sorry, but I'm not familiar OR interested with what appears to be   'NEW AGE' medicine (ayurveda, crystals), with the exception of homeo-  pathy, of which I took a course. But Gordon, you already knew that -  you just wanted to make my system look a bit more far out, right?    I use homeopathy very little, since my cellular test (EMR) is hard to  beat for accuracy and minerals are more predictable, while homeopathy  does have a problem with reliability, especially in acute conditions.  An exception perhaps are homeopathic nosodes which act fairly quickly  and are more dependable in certain viral or bacterial situations.   GR>  My colleagues and I spend hours debating study design GR>  and results, even of therapies currently accepted as \\\"standard\\\". GR>  As good (well, adequate) scientists, we are prepared, *if  GR>  presented with appropriate data*, to abandon our most deeply held  GR>  beliefs in favor of new ideas.   I have met the challenges of hundreds of sceptics by verifying the  accuracy of measuring their mineral status to their total satisfac-  tion --- in other words EVERYONE INVOLVED is happy!  If you were to cook a meal, would you worry over whether EVERYONE   in this world would find it to their liking, or only those that end   up eating it?  Since I have financed every research project that I have undertaken   entirely myself, I don't need to follow any of your rules or guide-  lines to satisfy any aspects of a grant application, which YOU may   have to; neither am I concerned of whether or not my study designs   meet your or anyone else's criteria or acceptance.   GR>    Sorry Ron, if conviction were the ruler of truth, a flat Earth would GR>  still be the center of the Universe and epilepsy a curse of the gods.                            I think there would be more justification for an uneducated person  growing up in an uncivilized environment to believe in a flat earth,  than for a civilized, well educated and scientifically trained mind  to follow the doctrine of evolution.  Genetic engineering of course is now the final frontier to show God  how it is (properly) done. Now we've become capable of creating our  own paradise and give disease (and God) the boot, right?   But just before we get rid of Him for good, perhaps He could leave us  some pointers on how to solve a couple of tiny problems, such as war,   poverty, racism, crime, riots, substance abuse... And one last thing,   could He also give us a hint on how to control natural disasters, the  weather, and last, but not least --- peace?     --Ron--\",\"Howdy,  I'm a little new to this newsgroup, but I would like to tap some of the knowledge and expertise available here.  The Subject:  After-market cruise controls  The Background: I recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five  screws, yuk! :-( ).  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my home) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to drive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of a good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do all the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.  My question: What is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I realize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a thing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of accuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle.  I have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with kettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not electronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying to give information as completly as I can).  I found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system  instead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy this CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?  It has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the  negative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I understand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read it in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but harder to install.  Is there really a big difference?  It has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a sensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which would wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned  the thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it were for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.  The installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal and a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm not sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what exactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it?  I think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative side tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and all that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:   1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a      device?  2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?  3.  Are \\\"professionally\\\" installed CCs signifacantly better and      worth the cabbage?  4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just      that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple       needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,      the questions above)?  My father and I built a \\\"Veep\\\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in high school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and cars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain that I get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my Veep. :-)  I appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.

Be that as it may....  Clemens is always in this form, and Viola isn't really performing beyond what might reasonably have been expected. How do you know that the Sox are responding to them, and not to Al Bumbry, Hobson, or (my most likely suspect) new hitting coach Mike Easler? I certainly am more likely to give Easler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola.  This was the optimistic scenario, but not unreasonably so. He hasn't shown much power yet, though.  How can you tell that Dawson is providing the leadership? Perhaps it's Calderon? Perhaps it's Clemens and Viola? Maybe Hobson is finally showing those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybe it's all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not as well as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher.  In three games. Why don't we look at this one again in, say, July?  A bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don't forget that Zupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB's last year. Beware of small sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'd be a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be aware that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as long as he doesn't have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.  Ummm...sorry, no. I can buy the \\\"in the field\\\" part, and I think he'll be better at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he'll be a pretty good hitter, couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap. With a little luck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs, Ventura, and Palmer will all be better).   See, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500 is plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like \\\"could run away with the division\\\" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white coats. It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If Russell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitch just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could be better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're too stupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's a lefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.

I originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone here will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but are missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as an intro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.  *** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it *** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a *** different version.  The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They are fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes, anyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a \\\"virtual screen\\\", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with no transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included a simple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256 color GIF image into a buffer.

Now, where *did* I put those sackcloth and ashes?

Perhaps I should beg your pardon for being *too* precise in my use of language?   I will believe that this process comes even close to approaching technological and economic feasibility (given the mixed nature of the trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of separating things first and having a different 'run' for each actinide) when I see them dump a few tons in one end and pull (relatively) clean material out the other.  Once the costs, technological risks, etc., are taken into account I still class this one with the idea of throwing waste into the sun.  Sure, it's possible and the physics are well understood, but is it really a reasonable approach?

The greatest danger of the escrow database, if it were kept on disk, would be the chance that a complete copy could somehow leak out.  You can design lots of protection, but with enough corruption a complete copy is always possible.   Storing it on paper or something very hard to copy at once may actually make sense.  Or a medium that can't be copied -- for example, something with very slow access times or which leaves a destructive trail if it is even read.  Of course then it's hard to backup.  However, I think the consequences of no backup -- the data is not there when a warrant comes -- are worse than the consequences of a secret backup.  An audit trail that reveals when data has been access, that *can't* be erased by the humans involved, is also necessary.\",\" You know, you're absolutely right.

Ahola had only played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose Mercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been spectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points); it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn out to be ... Peter Ahola.  #24 DOUG WILSON  Season: 16th Acquired: '91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and   2nd round pick in '92 entry draft Grade:  I (B)  I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out. Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which, unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for 2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be Wilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.  #29 DEAN KOLSTAD  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (C-/D+)  It's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of games (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games, he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with the Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in his level of performance to have any chance of making the team.  #38 PAT MACLEOD  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (?)  MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my memory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with Kansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment, a \\\"rehab assignment\\\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs. Since he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive skills.  #41 TOM PEDERSON  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (B+)  Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated by injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours truly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in 43 games.  However, his size (5' 9\\\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically, on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach. But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.  #45 CLAUDIO SCREMIN  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (D+/D)  He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a small sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is quickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or defense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that will go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.\",\"How can the government tell which encryption method one is using without being able to decode the traffic? i.e., In order to accuse me of using an unauthorized strong encryption technique they would have to take both keys out of escrow, run them against my ciphertext and \\\"draw a blank\\\".\",\"Does anyone have some information on the relative fraction of the final cost of each component in an average hard drive?

Speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what it's worth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of Christianity.  Although I'm sure it's possible to argue theologically that we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basis of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): the three forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn't discriminate on the basis of sex, race or sexual orientation.  I found the moderator's FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommend everyone to read them.  There seem to be three different levels of acceptance:  1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever) 2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation (though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people who indulge 3) As 2, but \\\"love the sinner\\\" 4) Accept homosexuality altogether.  My experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2 are limited to a few fundamentalist sects).  I suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling that a 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, on discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex, would not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel the pressure not to exhibit their feelings.

The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they wanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.  Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining 6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks in the New Brunswick city.  The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if the season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold 1400 for this year.

Suppose I analyze the output of this chip and I'm able to determine which bits are the encrypted packet which contains the serial number and session key.  Suppose I also design a simple algorithm based on this information which takes the data containing the encrypted session key and twiddles a bit (or several) before it's sent down the line.  Mind you, I'm sure the NSA thought of this along with a dozen other attacks I can't imagine, and the system is probably somehow designed so that manipulation of this information will cause a compliant receiving chip to somehow fail to decrypt successfully.  But how? What if the two parties agree in advance on some kind of consistent bit-twiddling scheme, so the decryption chip sees the restored \\\"proper\\\" bitstream but an eavesdropper gets a E[K; UK] packet that's wrong?  I suppose this could be easily defeated if the chip \\\"sends\\\" that information out many times in slightly different ways, making it effectively impossible to be certain you know all the information being sent.\",\"Jesus:     Black and white.  A spade is a spade.  There is no hidden agenda behind this, so stop trying to look for one.   It is an easy and as straight forward as it reads.  Kent, I am not accusing you of evil things.  Jesus is accusing you. And it is not only you that He is accusing.  He is accusing everyone. Me, you and everyone in the world is guilty.  Whether one sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with  whether we do evil things.  We do them regardless.    Jesus uses the word \\\"men\\\".  I am included.  Jesus is not soloing you out. Jesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man. Christians are not immuned from doing evil things.  A Christian  is just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells.  A Christian  can see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been brought out into the light.  Jesus is not saying that just because evil has been exposed, that the Christian will stop doing evil.  If you haven't seen Jesus's light, your evil deeds simply haven't been exposed to the His light.  You may shed some light on your own.  Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela.  But the Holy Spirit shines at a Megacandela.  The Holy Spirit can shine light into places inside us where we didn't even know existed.   So do you see Jesus's point?  Christians are not perfect.  Nonchristians are not perfect.  Nonchristians do not want to come into the Light of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives, and they will not like the sight.  It is an ugly thing to see how far we have fallen from Jesus's perspective.  Do you think you want to know how really ignorant you are?  Do you think Brian Kendig wants to know?  Do you think I want to know?  Ego verses the truth, which do you choose?   And I watched Koresh too, an imposter who thought he saw the light,  who made sure that the 19 children burned to death, sadly, as part of his delusion.  It is even sadder that the people who died with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance was their downfall to death.   And Kent, don't you bury yourself underneath a rock with an excuse like bringing up Koresh--as if Koresh actually had truth in him. David Koresh was no light and no excuse for you to stay away from the real Jesus Christ.  David Koresh, who claimed to be Jesus, was a fraud.  It was obvious.  David Koresh was born in America. Jesus was born in Bethlehem.  Koresh wasn't even a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that.  Jesus warned of such imposters in the end-times.  David Koresh wasn't anything new to Jesus.  Jesus told us to be aware of imposters 2000 years ago.    So the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to be Jesus.  Ask the obvious.  Where were you born?  Was your mother's name Mary?  If the Branch Davidians asked that simple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liar right from the start.  The wouldn't have followed Koresh. They wouldn't have died.  But look what happened.  Their ignorance cost them their lives.  Their choice to be ignorant cost them a lot.  Kent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do you not remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus?   Did not Satan quote the Bible out of context?  Do you remember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt Eve?  Did he not misquote God?  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded,  was the same ploy he tried on Jesus.  But in Jesus's case, Jesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context.  It didn't work with Jesus.    Does what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan tried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what Koresh did to his followers?  Who did Koresh emulate? Who was Koresh's teacher?  Koresh did to his followers what Satan did to Eve.  Did not Koresh kill his followersr?  Did not Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well?  Did not the cult followers believe Koresh even though they knew the real Christ was born in Bethlehem?   Did not Eve choose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil despite knowing that it would cause her death?  God held them all responsible--deceiver and the rebeller.

Will the higher : resolution be noticed for these? :  If you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript. I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language that is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript. It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower resolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product uses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation processed PS.  The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.  We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's demo though).

But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction    and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?    What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that    Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?    This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically    stood by the Pope.  The ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This is the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his departure from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands from *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be disobeyed.  My own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it would be too complex for people to figure out.  I don't view the present situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated. Run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the Catholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.     It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is    disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over    authority and discipline.    The problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic Faith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the Catholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops.  It's basically the Reformation part II.  There is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the Catholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an hour, probably.  Take the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I'm reading a book on what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio de Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old catechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the Catholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He innoculated the people against what was coming.  Well, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came when the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope recovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really wanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence. The Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.  The injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop was installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer's clergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New Mass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass. The people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop was *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The priests would just start building new churches; the people were completely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the bishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.  The prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to canon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V. Nor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.  During all this process, the people of Campos, not just private individuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending petitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist bishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome. Eventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.     My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:    Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   don't jointly make such  choice.)     If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.    If I adopt the view that \\\"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and    there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\\\", that    I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  If the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end of the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in Catholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an instant non-Catholic.  The problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are doing, they would be shocked!     We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \\\"real\\\"    traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter    East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.  This isn't the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body of traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are especially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is.     I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow    error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`    I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  That's heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job since the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors spread that it's pitiful.  Infallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the short term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In fact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: large sections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been much more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long run.     What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement    regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how    do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?    Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.    Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,    one way or the other.  Yes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what is he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of the Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic schools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?     It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the    Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\",\"THE WHITE HOUSE                      Office of the Press Secretary  ____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                                  April 5, 1993                          REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT         EN ROUTE TO CAMDEN YARDS FOR ORIOLES OPENING DAY GAME                                      MARC Train                        En Route to Camden Yards    11:45 A.M. EDT              Q   Mr. President, what do you think of Jesse Jackson's  protest today?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's an informational protest.   I think it's fine.  The owners put out a statement few days ago,  which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase  minority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we  should.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado.   And I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's  a legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an  informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to  the game.  So, I think it's good.              Q   Do you think they're moving fast enough?              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first  step.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an  issue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to  give it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will  highlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.              Q   Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate  on the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break  that and get cloture?              THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I  mean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one  of the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you  know, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate  the majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not  like the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they  can stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a  lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote  for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political  pressure not to do it.                And, of course, what it means is that in this time when  no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an  economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're  willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston  and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very  sad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in  a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans  had always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the  program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots  level, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they  have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep  Americans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.

Did you ever read newspaper at all?   \\\"PAINFUL SEARCH ..\\\"  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \\\"Hojali Disaster\\\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \\\"We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\\\" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. \\\"We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.\\\"  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. \\\"Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\\\" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. \\\"This  is just a small percentage of the dead,\\\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. \\\"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.\\\"  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  \\\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\\\" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  \\\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.\\\"  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.  THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92   HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES  AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.  \\\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\\\" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. \\\"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive.\\\"  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  \\\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  \\\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother.  \\\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\\\" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \\\"We have never got any of the bodies back.\\\"  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  \\\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\\\" Mr Sadikov said. \\\"I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock.\\\"  Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same type from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and had closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.  Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?  If you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.   As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more  than you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in  the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is  at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second marker?    Anyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the  light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have a problem detecting the end of the tape.  If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor is out.   If it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for repair.   --- Scott Hiles whiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil\",\"   The Sound Driver is pretty ok, since it's fast. Sound Manager used by the book is *useless*. Disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed is out of the question for games with smooth animation. (It's too slow.)  The Sound Driver is so much snappier than Sound Manager. Unfortunately, System 7 supports it poorly, making programs crash occasionally.   Well, I want my code to work on old systems too. I don't know about sys 7.1, but at least on 6.0.7, there are bugs in the Sound Manager that causes channels to hang (with no error message). This happends when I keep a channel open for long periods - necessary for performance - and play many sounds, stopping sounds halfway. Callbacks seems not to be reliable. Then only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to inspect private variables in the channel (QHead, I think it was), and the only way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an *undocumented* flag and modify it.  Am I happy with this? Nope. I consider writing to SoundBase simply to get rid of the bugs.  Any better suggestions?

Withdraw because of casualties would tell the Lebanese people that all they need to do to push Israel around is kill a few soldiers.  Its not gonna happen.

My opinion, FWIW, to all:  Mark, age doesn't matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays better than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las Vegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major league hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have the league data from the mid-80s to check it out.  That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to start the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league season in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very poorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill are not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers, they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around .220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on the Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at any level, at any age, doesn't satisfy MY standards of evidence.

Granted, I thought his behavior with McCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first time he ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But he has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is more valuable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24), had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor, EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF (which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15 best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching his \\\"prime\\\" season of 27. He should be considered as a legitimate prospect, and not as a simple side-show attraction.

I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed to Islamic movements and the PLO; it simply can't be proven as part of their plan !  (Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity since it was coined by Bnai Brith)  What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media, is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.  However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.  As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.  Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the Jews used to establish their state : Religion. \",\"Alan Sepinwall writes  George will do the only logical thing he can do when the Yanks' bullpen isn't   performing -- fire the manager. \",\"Dear friends,  I am a graduate student in Education at the University of Tennessee.

(The newest is the T9000 which kicks anyone's butt :)... haven't seen them used much though).  Anyway, to respond, I think the Pentium (CISC) is better than the more advanced RISC (e.g., like the alpha, etc.  the 66MHz Pentium has approximately the same \\\"performance\\\" as the superduper 133MHz Alpha - here, performance is the weird Specint92 that everyone refers to? - this is what I *heard* - the Alpha still kicks in the P5's butt in fp - again, this is what I *heard*). and in the computing world, if you sell lots of chips (like intel), and make it faster (like intel), you are the winner (like intel), even though you have a sucky architecture from over 10 years ago (like intel :0).  If you can make a \\\"CISC\\\" chip (superscalar, superduperpipelined, superfast) with the ideas behind the \\\"RISC\\\" ideology, you got a CISC chip.  And then I admit I can't see the advantages of RISC over CISC...  If the latest technology is a generation behind, then it sucks (relatively speaking).

[FARID] To count on Iranian help to supposedly counter Turkish influence will  [FARID] be a fatal error on the part of Armenia as long as Armenia in  [FARID] violation of international law has Azerbaijani lands in occupation.   Armenia is not counting on Iranian help. As far as violations of international laws, which international law gives Azerbaijan the right to attack and  depopulate the Armenians in Karabakh?  [FARID] If Armenian aggression continues in the territory of Azerbaijan, not  [FARID] only there won't be any aid from Iran to Armenia but also steps will  [FARID] be taken to have Armenian army back in Armenia.

[FARID] Iran is not alian to developing the capability to produce the A bomb  [FARID] and a reliable delivery system (refer to recent news releases  [FARID] regarding the potential of Iran).   So the Azeris from Iran are going to force the Armenians from Karabakh by forcing the Iranian government to drop an atomic bomb on these Armenians.  [FARID] The moral of the story is that, you don't go invading your neighbor's  [FARID] home (Azerbaijan) and flash Russia's guns when questioned about it.   Oh, but it's just fine if you drop an atomic bomb on your neighbor! You are a damn fool, Farid!

That's the disturbing part - use of other products IS voluntary, for now, and the press releases talk about the White House's unwillingness to decide that citizens have a right to good commercial crypto gear, and about how commercial alternatives will be permitted as long as they provide key escrow services.  That's a clear implication that they're considering banning alternatives.  Additionally, use of real alternatives ISN'T totally legal - you're not allowed to export really good crypto equipment except to the government's friends (e.g. the Australian government) you can only export even BAD crypto equipment with their permission, and the regulators who control the cellular telephone companies make sure there are only two competitors, so Joe's Garage Cellular can't start offering a secure service.  \",\"Is there a FAQ on Cyrix 486DLC?

I'm not trying to be contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions? What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time? This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically stood by the Pope.  It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over authority and discipline.    My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:    Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   don't jointly make such  choice.)  If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority. If I adopt the view that \\\"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\\\", that I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  The Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdiction viewing authority as present in each bishop, and in Ecumenical Councils.  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines  regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of the Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going into the merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree that a split occurred, and don't paly what appear to be semantic games like \\\"He's the Pope, but we don't recognize that what he does is effective...\\\".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \\\"real\\\" traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.    I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.` I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility? Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand. Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome, one way or the other.   It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.    True enough.   One could argue that they are establishing a non-geographic jurisdiction. I don't know if that's even a concept or problem in Catholic circles.

Gillow, who had  secretly  studied the innermost workings of the Vatican since returning from Vietnam in a wheel chair, first approached the scientific community with his  theory in the late 1950's.  \\\"The  whole hat  thing, that was just a cover  up.

About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes  under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement  of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of  the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced  the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor   suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.   While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being   manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently  increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (  palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part  the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had  been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the  pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is   persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3  and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides  minor reductions in pain and is only short term.     My questions are:        Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the      levels of pain?       Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?       Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?     Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.         Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.

And Windows 3.1 is also flexible enough at install time that you can copy all the files onto your hard disk, which greatly speeds things up and makes them less annoying, if you can spare the 7 or so compressed megs.   No, we're not.  But we're also not going to promote pandering to corporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience.  I don't *like* dealing with floppies.  Personally, I have no use for changing the registration info, but I see it as a valid need, and one that ought to be solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hour reinstall that's just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one way or another.  So, while I'm not going to put much time into it myself, here's the procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information:  1.  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want to install it.  I've been using c:\\\\WINSTALL myself.  2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\\\\WINORIG.  3.  Install from c:\\\\winstall.  4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.       i.e., comp *.* \\\\winorig\\\\*.* >\\\\report.txt  5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming they didn't cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one file should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate said offset in the original directory and see what's there using a hex editor, and do the same for the modified one.  6.  You're on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don't really do cryptography.  It's probably just an xor key or something; I think MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing his copy than with \\\"real pirates\\\" who will probably just disassemble the damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original floppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able to back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a compare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).  As I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and don't do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one directory to another may be less arduous.  Doing some of the stuff I've mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft, as if they'd ever find out.  If you aren't careful with the disk editor, you could also mung something important... duh.  I guess that's a disclaimer.  Have at it....

In other words, there was no evidence of illegal arms, just enough of a suggestion to get a judge to sign a license to search for illegal evidence.\",\"  You are conveniently ommitting the fact that the Arab governments told the Arab citizens of Israel to leave Israel, join with the Arab armies so that after what they felt like an assured victory occured, these Arabs could return to their former homes, reclaim them as well as anything else they wanted that belonged to Jews.  When the Arabs lost, Israel was left with a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back into the country as citizens.  What would you have done?  Let them in so they could kill Jews?  Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens  because they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn't leave.  Of course some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing between the two is impossible.  Therefore a decision was made based on secuturity of the country.   No kibbutz that I have ever visited has any \\\"employees\\\" unless they had to hire some people for the restaurants, hotels etc if there weren't enough  people ON the kibbutz to do them.  In such cases, they are paid properly. If a kibbutz turns away an Arab, 9I have never seen or heard of this) but it reflects only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz, not the whole kibbutz movement.   This just shows how ignorant you are of Israeli politics.  Although the  major parties in Israel aren't religious (however not totally secular), due to the format of the government (coalition) the religious parties have always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition. In fact, from what I heard the present government is the least influenced by the religious parties in the existance of Israel.  Israel CANNOT be called a secular state.  For instace, Haifa is the only city in the country (except for maybe some Arab cities) where buses run on the Jewish Sabbath.   There are many other examples of religion in Israel.  Marriages in Israel are NOT contolled by the state, but by Rabbis and Priests.  Obviously your  disbelief of this fact sheds some light of your ignorance of the country you claim to know so much about.

Cypherpunk remailer source is at soda.berkeley.edu in the   /pub/cypherpunks directory.  It's written in PERL, and is   relatively easy to install (no administrative rights are required).   Karl Barrus  <elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu> has more information and   modifications. Also, most remailer operators mentioned above are   amenable to discussing features, problems, and helping new sites   become operational. Address all points in the section   ``responsibities of anonymous use'' in this document prior to   advertising your service.  You should be committed to the long-term   stability of the site and avoid running one surreptitiously.  _____ <4.8> What are references on privacy in email?

It provides an anonymous medium through which MIT   > students can say those things they might otherwise find   > difficult, inconvenient or impossible to say in person.  It's   > also a way to send fun or totally random messages to your   > friends over the air.

For more   information send email to crosslink@athena.mit.edu.   MISCELLANEOUS =============  _____ <5.1> What is ``digital cash''?    With digital encryption and authentication technologies, the   possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be   realized.  A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks   (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may   be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and   anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an   economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum   (~Dec.1992).    An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus   <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the   cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to   elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:      ::     command: help          user@host    where `user@host' is your email address.      _____ <5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?    These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,   especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past   a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as   breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most   internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a   ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,   curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a   system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and   patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also   the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.     _____ <5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?    From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:    > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were   > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy   > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,   > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant   > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people   > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,   > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek   > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or   > their opinions.    See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.    See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary   in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.  _____ <5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?    Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the   techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication   but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself.    Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the   proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible   to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,   typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is   posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually   untraceable  communication can take place between sender and   receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic   realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where   individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual   users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An   anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman   (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to   <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following   commands in the subject line:      subscribe     unsubscribe     help  _____ <5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?    `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain   protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information   or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make   public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade   `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be   concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in   operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that   some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious   because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This   argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet   posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a   very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at   worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ   for alt.security.        Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic   Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First   International Symposium on National Security & National   Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:    > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep   > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's   > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If   > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there   > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I   > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into   > an environment where any information which is at all interesting   > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little   > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,   > but you may differ...  _____ <5.6> What are `identity daemons'?      RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to   query a remote user's login name after connection to a local   communication socket (a connection of this type is established   during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not   widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement   it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to   anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system   adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a   trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.  _____ <5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?     Remailing/Posting   -----------------      - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,     publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.   - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET     postings.   - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information     obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,     encrypted addresses, etc.)   - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and     remailer site chaining.      General   -------      - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy     shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the     general public and their governments.   - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies      by systems designers into     hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'     `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.   - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than     wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement     agencies.   - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government     agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to     strengthening and protecting it.   ISSUES ======  _____ <6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?    From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:    > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic   > media which connect us.  Computer-based communication media like   > electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis   > of new forms of community.  These communities without a single,   > fixed geographical location comprise the first settlements on an   > electronic frontier.   >    > While well-established legal principles and cultural norms give   > structure and coherence to uses of conventional media like   > newspapers, books, and telephones, the new digital media do not   > so easily fit into existing frameworks.  Conflicts come about as   > the law struggles to define its application in a context where   > fundamental notions of speech, property, and place take   > profoundly new forms. People sense both the promise and the   > threat inherent in new computer and communications technologies,   > even as they struggle to master or simply cope with them in the   > workplace and the home.   >    > The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been established to help   > civilize the electronic frontier; to make it truly useful and   > beneficial not just to a technical elite, but to everyone; and to   > do this in a way which is in keeping with our society's highest   > traditions of the free and open flow of information and   > communication.      EFF was started by the multimillionaire Mitchell Kapor, founder of   Lotus software, and John Barlow, lyricist for the Grateful Dead   rock band.  A highly publicized endeavor of the organization   involved the legal defense of  Steve Jackson Games after an FBI   raid and an accompanying civil suit  (see section on ``Steve   Jackson Games'').  The foundation publishes EFF News (EFFector   Online) electronically, send requests to effnews-request@eff.org.      In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee   with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated   November 5, 1991,  Representative  Edward J. Markey complemented   Mitchell Kapor on his ``insights on the development of a national   public information infrastructure'' which ``were appreciated greatly   by myself and the Members of the Subcommittee'' (complete text in    ftp.eff.com:/pub/pub-infra/1991-12):    > ...we need to pursue policies that encourage the Bell companies to   > work with other sectors of the communications industry to create   > a consumer-oriented, public information network. Please let me or   > my staff know what policies you and others in the computer   > industry believe would best serve the public interest in creating   > a reasonably priced, widely available network in which   > competition is open and innovation rewarded.  I also want to   > learn what lessons from the computer industry over the past ten   > to fifteen years should apply to the current debate on   > structuring the information and communications networks of the   > future....I ask your help in gaining input from the computer   > industry so that the Subcommittee can shape policies that will   > bring this spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship to the   > information services industry.      ftp.eff.org   ===========      /pub/eff/about-eff   ---     A file of basic information about EFF including goals, mission,     achievements, and current projects.

The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility have been   working to protect and promote electronic civil liberties issues   since ~1982.  The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,   Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation   against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other   U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation   on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,   NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in   Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on   Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to   testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and   caller identification.    CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available   via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising   the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For   more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.     (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions   here.)  _____ <6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?    In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies   on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in   such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.      (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):    > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May   > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card   > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success.    > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying   > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of   > their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some   > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department   > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide   > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of   > jurisdictions.    Massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated   instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a   crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal   search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of   Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST   by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science   Fiction Magazine:    > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional   > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the   > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared   > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,   > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin   > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only   > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place.    > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that   > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document   > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.    FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed   on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier   Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an article by Joe   Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1, 1993:      > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret   > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal   > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a   > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,   > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment.    >    > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in   > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1,   > 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke   > over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer   > seizure policies.  While the Service has seized dozens of   > computers since the crackdown began in 1990, this is the first   > case to challenge the practice.    >    > Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin   > science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never   > suspected of a crime, and that agents did not do even marginal   > research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and   > the suspected illegal activities of an employee, or to determine   > that the company was a publisher. Indeed, agents testified that   > they were not even trained in the Privacy Protection Act at the   > special Secret Service school on computer crime.    >    > \\\"How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what   > Steve Jackson Games did, what it was?\\\" asked Sparks. \\\"An hour?    >    > \\\"Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to   > Steve Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything   > taken?    >    > \\\"Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had   > a picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen   > -- saying he was a computer crime suspect?    >    > \\\"Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material   > could harm Steve Jackson economically?\\\"    >    > Foley replied, \\\"No, sir,\\\" but the judge offered his own answer.    >    > \\\"You actually did, you just had no idea anybody would actually go   > out and hire a lawyer and sue you.\\\"    >    > More than $200,000 has been spent by the Electronic Frontier    > Foundation in bringing the case to trial.

ISDN is a high-speed data communications standard that utilizes   existing copper telephone lines, and is a possible inexpensive and   intermediate alternative to laying fiber optic cable for phone   networks.  The speeds involved may be sufficient for audio and   video transmission applications.  G.

FOOTNOTES =========   _____ <7.1> What is the background behind the Internet?     The article ``Internet'' in Fantasy and Science Fiction by Bruce   Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> contains general and nontechnical   introductory notes on origins of the Internet, including the role   of the RAND corporation, the goal of network resilience in face of   nuclear attack, MIT, UCLA, ARPANET, TCP/IP, NSF, NREN, etc.:    > ARPANET itself formally expired in 1989, a happy victim of its    > own overwhelming success.  Its users scarcely noticed, for   > ARPANET's  functions not only continued but steadily improved.    > The use of  TCP/IP standards for computer networking is now   > global.  In 1971, a  mere twenty-one years ago, there were only   > four nodes in the  ARPANET  network.  Today there are tens of   > thousands of  nodes in  the Internet,  scattered over forty-two   > countries, with more coming  on-line every day.   Three million,   > possibly four million people use  this gigantic   > mother-of-all-computer-networks.      >    > The Internet is especially popular among scientists, and is    > probably the most important scientific instrument of the late    > twentieth century.   The  powerful, sophisticated access that it    > provides to specialized data and personal communication  has sped   > up the pace of scientific research enormously.     >    > The Internet's pace of growth in the early 1990s is  spectacular,    > almost ferocious.  It is spreading faster than cellular phones,   > faster  than fax machines.  Last year the Internet was growing at   > a rate of  twenty percent a *month.*  The number of `host'   > machines with direct  connection to TCP/IP has been doubling   > every year since  1988.   The Internet is moving out of  its   > original base in military and  research institutions,  into   > elementary and high schools, as well as into  public libraries   > and the commercial sector.

The problem I'm currently stuck on is that theres no algorithm which triangulates any arbitrary polygonal shape. Delaunay seems to be limited to convex hulls. Constrained delaunay may be okay, but I have no code example of how to do it.  Another way to do the bartman may be  - TGA2POV - A selfmade variation of this, using heightfields.    Create a b/w picture (BIG) of the text you need, f.i. using a PostScript   previewer. Then, use this as a heightfield. If it is white on black,   the heightfield is exactly the images white parts (it's still open   on the backside). To close it, mirror it and compound it with the original.  Example:  object {    union {       height_field { gif \\\"abp2.gif\\\" }       height_field { gif \\\"abp2.gif\\\" scale <1 -1 1>}    }    texture {       Glass    }    translate <-0.5 0 -0.5>      //center    rotate <-90 0 0>             // rotate upwards    scale  <10 5 100>            // scale bigger and thicker    translate <0 2 0>            // final placement }   abp2.gif is a GIF of arbitrary size containing \\\"ABP\\\" black on white in Times-Roman 256 points. \",\" Not to mention that the G-men believed the children didn't have gas masks.

I busted a gut on that one.  Someone else on the net observed that the administration's appeal to a woman's \\\"motherly instinct\\\" would never wash with feminists and liberals if a republican were in the White House.

The  henrik]  KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000  henrik]  years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are  henrik]  the ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT.

However,      I am sure YOU GUYS would have NEVER brought up ARMENIA's involvement if      KARABAKHI-Armenians had had HEAVY losses.

I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to   take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive   word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS    netters will be amiable in their explanation.)  Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say \\\"no good\\\" because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not  the authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time  before I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England,  Professor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the  following as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring  1993 edition):    \\\"I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--   or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other    with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian    or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around   a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude   those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central   defining characteristic of a good American might be \\\"one who doesn't draw   exclusive circles\\\" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the    central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to   draw a circle around \\\"Mormon\\\" or \\\"Christian,\\\" to decide who is \\\"orthodox\\\"   and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider   that the central pillar of Christ's \\\"orthodoxy\\\" is our ability to love   unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.    \\\"I recently spent some time in a \\\"Christian\\\" bookstore in California. The   service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and   well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural   commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.   But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking    others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American   culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to \\\"Cults and the   Occult,\\\" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same   rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found   I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers   (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous   anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations   of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).    \\\"It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to   Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (\\\"Perfect   love casteth out fear,\\\" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the   LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a    disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the   same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive   action---as the \\\"religious right wing\\\" has launched this year against the   political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like.   It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the   very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,   if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of   others they believe to be evil.\\\"   The above \\\"sermon\\\" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe to This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His arms.    Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles  of the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim  perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do  now lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled \\\"Christian\\\", if  those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are  intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical  scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication  than mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the  majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective  voice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter  the LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths  and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to  disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves.  Let us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion  and conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.   \",\" [deletions]   Sounds like it is an SMD interface to me, not being at work now to actually count pins.  there are two varients, SMD  and SMDC (I think), only minor differences between them.  Widely used prior to the advent of SCSI for large drives (or all drives) on minis (and mainframes(?) no experience on those).\",\" I'm sure it is, and I am not amused.  Every time I read that part of the TIFF spec, it infuriates me- and I'm none too happy about the complexity of the spec anyway- because I think their \\\"arbitrary but carefully chosen number\\\" is neither.  Additionally, I find their choice of 4 bytes to begin a file with meaningless of themselves- why not just use the letters \\\"TIFF\\\"?  (And no, I don't think they should have bothered to support both word orders either- and I've found that many TIFF readers actually don't.)\",\"  If I don't think my belief is right and everyone else's belief is wrong, then I don't have a belief. This is simply what belief means. Where does the authority for a belief come from? Nowhere, for a belief is itself authoratative. If I produce authority for a belief, where will I find authority for my belief in the legitimacy of the authority. In short,  the mind has to start somewhere. (By the way, the majority of Christians, i.e. Catholics, believe in the authority of the Church, and derive the authority of the Bible from its acceptance by the Church.)\",\" Oh, darn. Okay, okay, let's stop slamming Ipser, and get on with making fun of other people.\",\"I posted this about tow weeks ago but never saw it make it (Then again I've had some problems with the mail system). Apologies if this appears for the second time:  Usually when I start up an application, I first get the window outline on my display. I then have to click on the mouse button to actually place the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry  option the window appears right away, the properties specified by the -geometry argument. The question now is:  How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify window position with a mouseclick? I've tried explicitly setting window size and position, but that did alter the normal program behaviour.

BUT you (and I guess your single-source news agency CNN) failed to mention the Davidians pouring kerosene all over and lighting it in plain view.   Well, small-scale Jim Jones type suicide with fire instead of kool-aid.   Sorry, guy, you got it wrong.  ATF was pumping tear gas into the compound. The Branch Davidians (going along with their apocolyptic faith) set their own compound on fire killing all but 9 or so.  No children survived.   Self-slaughter, anyway.  I pity the children who were to young to be able to make a conscious choice.   You are wrong.  Thank goodness.  I would suggest, however, that you take a deep breath, and wait 30 minutes or so before posting.  Also make sure your facts are correct before making your allegations(sp.).   You repeated wrong.  There were 9.   God help the Branch Davidians.   NO DON'T!!!!  THERE IS WAY TOO MUCH OF THIS CRAP BEING CROSSPOSTED ALL OVER CREATION AS IT IS!!!!!! \",\"Hi,  xtici worked for my system.

We have biblical accounts of both his mother's ancestry and his father's, both tracing back to David.  It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that Jesus was Semitic.  As an interesting aside, Jesus' being semitic makes him neither \\\"white\\\" nor \\\"black,\\\" and in some sense underscores the point made earlier that his color was not important, it was his message, his grace, and his divinity that we should concentrate on.  Finally, I would direct anyone interested in African involvement in the church to the account of the conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts chapter 9 (I think it's chapter 9).  This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch, treasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely African.  Because \\\"Ethiopia\\\" at that time indicated a region just south of Egypt, many also speculate that this man was not only the first African Christian, but the first black Christian as well.   God bless, Charles Campbell \",\" > repeated lives on earth.\",\"  It has been done already!  In the UK the Atari ST box was shipped with 360K disks in the first few years and then later 720K disks. In order to make life less complicated, many freebie disks on mags were double formatted like this. Side 0 of the disk had 360K on it and could be read  by any ST. It also had a flip-side program. This would swap the sides around so that side 1 became side 0.  -- \",\"Haven't seen this one on here yet, so here it goes:  B. arely A. dequate, T. otally F. ***ed!

One of my users has a Duo 230 ([*]specifications below) that has been having slowdown problems. Leaving the Duo on for several hours causes it to slow down unacceptably. It can take 10-15 seconds to change applications. During this time it is completely hung.  If he reboots, the problem goes away (For a while). It seems the system is getting itself into a wedged configuration.  He's re-installed System 7.1 and rebuilt the desktop. Neither of these have helped.   It's possible that it's network-related, he uses Eudora which checks his email every 10 minutes (over Ethernet). He hasn't checked to see if this problem occurs while undocked (he's docked most of the time).   Little to no non-Apple inits, I don't want to start yanking the rest unless I know that might *really* be the problem.   He hasn't tried zapping the PRAM, I have advised him to do that next.  Anyone who has ideas, I'd love to hear about them. I'd call Apple, but I've found they're best to call during the week (it's Sunday evening).

(Or is it only applicable in cases like this?)  :-  I remember an article of about a year ago which stated that besides his wife, Saddam also has a mistress.  Assad's brother has a wife and *several* mistresses, and those 'emirs' in the Gulf have, within their lifetimes, wives in the double digitas (only they manage to keep four at a time).   This is all irrelevant.  It takes a *lot* more than infidelity to make these leaders ruthless and corrupt.  Maybe Netanyahu thought he could 'cleanse' himself by making such a public confession.  Does the average secular Israeli care, though?  The Mossad probably applauded him.  :-) \",\"   # I hope I gave you a fairly solid answer to this one: I simply don't agree # with the embodied version of a Satan who is a separate creation or a force.    # And there are quite physical descriptions of Heaven and Hell in the # Holy Qur'an, the Bible, etc.  There have been times in the spiritual # and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical # descriptions of Heaven, Hell, and Satan were taken quite literally # and that *worked* for the time.  As I mentioned in the Tradition # cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory # about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the \\\"evil\\\" # which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as \\\"satanic.\\\"       Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is      metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not      the same way?  # The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane # in human language is something like describing \\\"color\\\" to a person # who has been blind from birth.  You may want to read the book # FLATLAND (if you haven't already) or THE DRAGON'S EGG.  The first # is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con- # cept...  [some deleted for space saving]  # When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe # another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then # such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be # necessary.  The \\\"unseen\\\" is described in terms which have reference` # and meaning for the reader/listener.  But, like all models, a compro- # mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness # of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all # crippled.  But what else can you do?       This is why I asked the above.  How would you then      know God exists as a spirit or being rather than      just being metaphorical?  I mean, it's okay to say      \\\"well, Satan is just metaphorical,\\\" but then you      have to justify this belief AND justify that God is      not some metaphor for something else.       I say this because there are many, many instances of      Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in       the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the      New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is      described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know      one is metaphorical and not the other.       Further, belief in God isn't a bar to evil.  Let's      consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were      metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe      in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a       case where someone does believe in God, but by      religious standards, they are \\\"evil.\\\"  If Bobby      does see this, let him address this question also.

What I heard about this study was that in one 'personality', a MPDS patient exhibited no observable or clinical signs of inhalant allergy (scratch tests were used, according to what I heard), while in other personalities they showed obvious allergy symptoms, including testing a full ++++ on scratch tests for particular inhalants.  If this is true, it is truly fascinating.  But, I'd like to know if this study was ever done, and if so, what the study really showed, and where the study is published.  Any help out there?

If you live in a place where crime is apparent, then it might be a good idea to get one simply as a deterrent.  However, if a professional thief wants your vehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do.  But to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options.  That would be:  1) ignition kill or fuel cut-off 2) a flashing red LED  These two are basic to a decent alarm system.   To slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock. That should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target. But, then there's always car-jacking.   Why is life so confusing?

That would make most people happy, and with some sort of verification procedure before key exchange, the \\\"official\\\" chips would only work with other \\\"official\\\" chips.  In other words, secrecy of SK makes \\\"physically identical clone versions\\\" impossible;  secrecy of the algorithm shouldn't be necessary.  Of course, revealing the algorithm opens them up to attacks on SK --- since all units share this key, compromising it may be a big deal. Personally, I wouldn't feel too comfortable knowing that one \\\"secret\\\" 80-bit number held in many places was all that guaranteed my security. Of course, compromise of SK doesn't necessarily mean that the system is compromised, but it's impossible to tell whether or not that's true with a secret algorithm.
