The solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather than a block, but how do you do this. I can't find any means although various sources seem to indicate it can be done.  When the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block. This would also be preferable but I can't seem to force this to be the default either.

That *is* a Nazi doctrine: rectification of the \\\"abnormal presence\\\" of the Jewish people within a  larger body politic.

I think I have a problem with the stereo sound output on my Quadra 900, but I am not totally sure because my roomate has the same problem on his PowerBook 170.  Any info or experience anyopne has would be greatly appreciated.  When I hook my Quadra up to my home stereo system, the following types of sounds (mono, as far as I can tell) all play fine through BOTH speakers:  system beeps  (already provided ones such as Indigo and ones I record)  Armor Alley Spectre Spaceward Ho!   But, the following games only play out of the left channel:  Lemmings Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW) Glider 4.0 OIDS   But still, STEREO system beeps do play in stereo, through BOTH speakers. (The one I'm specifically referrring to is Apocolyptic Beginning, which my roommate downloaded from some ftp site (sumex?))   All of the symptoms are the same on my rommates 170 (he can't run OOTW because he doesn't have color).  We're both running system 7.1    Does anyone with Lemmings or the other three games I mentioned above get sound out of both speakers on a Mac II class, Quadra, LC, PowerBook 140 or greater, Centris, SE/30, etc... (stereo) machine?  I used to have a Mac II, and I sort of rememeber Lemmings playing in stereo on that machine, not just on the left channel.  (I could be mistaken, though.  If there were a problem with the Quad 900's and PB 170's, I am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo?  If there isn't a problem with our machines, I wonder why the 4 games above are apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of both speakers  (like Spectre, etc. do)?  Quadra 900's and PowerBook 170's have the same ROMS (to my knowledge), so maybe this is a ROM problem?  (if so, though, why wouldn't System 7.1 patch over this problem?)

My brother who lives in the US bought and sent it to me, and I'm still trying to get used to it.  Before I put my good/bad points list, consider I am a Turbo Pascal/DOS programmer, and sometimes try to make something in Unix with C (just some exercises from university). I used to make some programs in Microsoft C version 5 (!!) because we used some third-party libraries that required that.  - I like Borland. It seems to me much more easier to use than Microsoft,   specially the debugger. I tried to learn Codeview sometimes, but never   felt confortable with it. - TC++ V/E seems very nice to create simple apps, like the examples on the   ObjectWindows book. So far, no problems. Lets see next week or so, when I   will try something more complex. - It works nice even in my \\\"weak\\\" machine 386/16Mhz, 6 Mb Ram.   But.....  - The manual for the Resource Workshop seems to be from a different version    from the Workshop itself. Some of the windows that appear on the manual   have more itens than in the manual. - I think I will run into trouble since I got this TC++/VE from my brother   as a present. I didnt wanted to buy the Japanese version because 1) I    suspect that the manuals will be in Japanese :-( and 2) I believe it   will be far more expensive here. So he bought it as a present and sent to   me, I send the registration card to the Japanese branch of Borland, but...   who knows.  So, I'd like to ask some questions for you all;  - I know that there are some Microsoft guys around here in this group. Is   there anybody from Borland ? Is there any e-mail address that we can    contact the technical support ? Not for stupid questions, but to ask   for example, why the RW manual seems to be different from the RW itself ? - Is there anybody else using it around here ? - Will the book of Petzold be useful for me ? I intend to use RW and ProtoGen   to make the interfaces and then work on the code itself.   Answers to my e-mail or comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools, please.

Hence big cooling towers.           Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the way down to ambient.

During WWII, the British managed to supply arms to the Yugoslavs despite German occupation.  If the Europeans had the will to do anything besides sponsoring peace conferences, they would have no problem putting any kind of weapon they wanted into Bosnia.  I guess I would favor ending the embargo if the Congress would pass a law forbidding export of US military supplies to Yugoslavia, including via third parties.

My views on this topic have evolved and clarified through this, and I suspect that we may not disagree as  much as we think.   I admit that I'm strongly prejudiced against evangelical Christianity, and I may not always be rational in my reactions to it.  I grew up in EC, and went to an EC college.  It was definitely the wrong place for me, and I react strongly to any implication that EC or conservative Christianity has any sort of stronghold on true Christianity.  I shudder  when I remember the condescending attitude I had about other Christians  who didn't adhere to the EC model.  I have come to see that my real objection to this whole notion of  absolute truth is the actions I have seen it lead to.  I have had some  very bad experiences with evangelical Christians claiming to know the  truth, and judging me or others based on their belief that they have  the answers.  Knowing the truth doesn't seem to leave a whole lot of  room for others' opinions.

Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; you shall not do any work - you, your son or daughter, your male or female slave, or your cattle, or the stranger who is within your settlements. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth and sea, and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and hollowed it.

Everything may be clean, but it's evil for the person who eats it in an offensive spirit. Better not to eat the meat or drink the wine or whatever else your brother is offended by. As for the faith that you have, keep that between yourself and God. The person is in luck who doesn't condemn himself for what he samples. On the other hand, the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty, because he isn't acting on his faith, and any failure to act on faith is a sin.\",\"      ^^^              what the hell is 'ios'?

It started happening about four years ago after I moved to my current town, although I don't know if that has anything to do with anything.

Basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling and the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the hot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is rapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently seen rising out of these towers.  That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.  The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference (sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage \\\"hot\\\" turbine to final stage \\\"cold\\\" turbine).

First, a rebuttle. Personally, I love under-dogs. Unlike  bandwagon jumpers, I abandon teams when they start winning. People that cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are afraid to be associated with something negative.   On this one point, I agree. The reason that people bash WASP's is  because they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top is going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top. If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people  for all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had  conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any better/worse than the whites did.  The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of the world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done (ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to the present generation who didn't participate in the crimes? Would it do  any good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stopped hundreds, even thousands, of years ago.   My opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let's change them. But don't blame me for what my ancestors did. It wouldn't settle anything anyway.   That's where you are dead wrong. You don't join up on a side just because they are winning. That makes you spineless. Winning, in high school and after high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't make you right. All the best causes in history were loosing causes (with only a couple exceptions). Winning only makes a difference to other people, not to yourself. And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care how you appear (ie. a Winner).   If you can't beat them, fight them every inch of the way.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \\\"At that moment the bottom fell out of Authur's mind.

Features:     Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.    No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).    Generic clients.    Customizable servers.    Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).    Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).    Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily         attached.  Functionality:    Client:    The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things    when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's    viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's    actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to    other users.     The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to    develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that    resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting    it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.     This release of the client software supports the following functionality:      o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)      o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)      o User Interface Panels      o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for  faster frame rates)      o Mouse and Keyboard Input     (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the    PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because    I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)    Server(s):    This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is    provided in this release for potential world server developers:      o Transparent Client Management      o Client Message Handling     This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of accepting and    terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer    can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.     Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is    what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:      o Server Selectable Extension Installation:         What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended         functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension         initialisers you want.      o Event Handler Registration:         When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback         functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.         (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)      o Collision Detection Registration:         If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide         some basic information to the collision detection management software.         Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.      This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because     the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects     from which to choose.      The following is all you need to make a World Server application:      o Provide an initWorld function:         This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus         any initialization you want to do.      o Provide a positionObject function:         This is where you determine where to place a new client.      o Provide an installWorldObjects function:         This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.      o Provide a getWorldType function:         This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.      o Provide an animateWorld function:         This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects         move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit         (to avoid outrunning the clients).      That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the     three world servers I've provided:          generic - 81 lines         dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the                            stairs!

Anthony Fauci, director of the  U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said,  \\\"We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly  can with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will  get around microbial resistance.\\\"  He said any delay would signify questions  over safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.  Fauci, who co- authored  one of the two papers published last week in Nature, rejects the   argument by one of his co-authors, Cecil Fox, that the new  discovery  indicates that \\\"$1 billion spent on vaccine trials\\\" has been \\\"a waste of time  and money\\\" because the trials were started  too long after the patients were  infected and were ended too  quickly.  John Tew of the Medical College of  Virginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument  for  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.

This finding  supports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of  contracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the  JAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive  surgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies  were conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and  Florida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and  tested all patients willing to participate.  The New Hampshire study found  that none of the  1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an   HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV.  In Maryland, 413 of 1,131  patients operated on by a breast surgery specialist at  Johns Hopkins Hospital  were found to be HIV-negative.

The Florida researchers, led by  Gordon  M. Dickinson of the University of Miami School of Medicine, said,  \\\"This study indicates that the risk for transmission of HIV from  a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in  which universal  precautions are strictly observed.\\\"   Related Story: Philadelphia Inquirer  (04/14) P.

The OAM is a small division of  the NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10  billion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available  research grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be  available this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for  Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid  to become involved in AIDS.  \\\"They have to look successful and there is no  easy answer in AIDS,\\\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the  OAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening,  such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an  advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS  community was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists'  general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic  will be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \\\"The OAM advisory  panel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It   will take them several years to accept the nature of research.\\\"    Nevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator  at the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \\\"Here is a  wonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It's only fair to give the  Office time to gel, but  it's up to the public to insist that it's much, much  more [than  public relations].\\\"  ======================================================================    \\\"Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers\\\" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143,  No. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.)        Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus- 6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack  causes the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in  the immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a  factor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research   found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte,  which is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  kill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural  killer cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's   research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural  killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony  L. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube  findings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the  body.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor   molecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface  receptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that  herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV.       ======================================================================                                    April 15, 1993       ====================================================================     \\\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\\\" Journal of the  American Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert,  George and Nordenberg, Dale F.)        All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only  ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health  problems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert  and Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana,  Calif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,   respectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care  about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for  the concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should  be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it  is not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many   respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic  development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.   Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have  on many developing countries, and the increased need for international  assistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political  aggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there  is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach  to international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in  particular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \\\"Earth in the  Balance\\\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable  international development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child  survival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the  developing  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically   change the future of worldwide health.  ====================================================================    \\\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\\\" Journal of the American   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth)        Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible  before the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less  attention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller  Foundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and  Nordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as  malaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited   economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention  than they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is  receiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most  developing countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic  diseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another  year  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS  and its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden  but financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a  rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each  individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley  says he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and   economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he  concludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the  United States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries  with high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic   has been the rule.

The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90  children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV- infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease.   HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as \\\"a  hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected  children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.\\\"   Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and  Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial \\\"is  the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay  disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.\\\"  If these  vaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their  therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in  the United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health  Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide.   The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which  funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial  at nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the  ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human  Development.   Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows  that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  stimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers  know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease.   The results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined  closely for other reasons as well.  \\\"This trial will provide the first insight  into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\\\" said  Daniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  \\\"We need this  information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent  HIV infection in children.\\\"   In the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city  areas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic.   Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during  pregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than  a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing  numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection  drug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding  increase in the numbers of infected children.   HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.   The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV  develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These  infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of  childhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms  leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays.   At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger  to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older  participants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no  symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen  liver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune- regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study.   Study chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical  School, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of  Medicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical  officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS.   \\\"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children  for any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or  fevers, for example, than another,\\\" said Dr. McNamara.  \\\"We'll also look at  whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other  significant laboratory or clinical effects.\\\"   He emphasized that the small  study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  products.   The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from  recombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically  engineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well- tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults.   One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a  protein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.   Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is  the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug  Administration.   Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco  and the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in  Emeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus  adjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine  contains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in  other Phase I vaccine trials in adults.   A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15  children.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the  experimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone,  considered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will  be told what they receive.   If the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the  experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will  begin.   Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six  months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

They report that HIV itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling  skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV.  Although the  HIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals'  immunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV  itself caused the skin disease.   Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease  without affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the  National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues  described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human  Retroviruses.   Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most  animals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this  problem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for  HIV as well as their own genetic material.   NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse  eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters  contained both normal and transgenic animals.   Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV  genetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon  after birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an  incomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer.   Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their  necks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin  lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No  skin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates.   Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a  type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can  cause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the  animals.   Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the  presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.    HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \\\"turned  on,\\\" or active, said Dr. Kopp.   The scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the  mice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common  infections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune  systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the  skin lesions, Dr. Kopp said.   Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists  exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV  genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.   Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the  genes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No  lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light.   The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter  Dickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  Diseases.   Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs.  Nickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR;  Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney,  formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.

Shalala today announced the first nationwide  clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care  professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV  infection or AIDS.       The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a  physician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on  drugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is  funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of  San Francisco General Hospital.       Secretary Shalala said, \\\"One goal of this project is to share expertise  so patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health  care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces  treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and  community social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients  with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\\\"       Secretary Shalala said, \\\"This clinical expertise should be especially  helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in  communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\\\"       The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and  it is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST)  Monday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer  questions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and  health care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be  answered as quickly as possible.       Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question  related to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment  information, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral,  literature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health  care professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate  sources of information or materials.       When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken  by either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse  practitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and  inpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant  asks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current  medications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history.

The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health  Professions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and  by the American Academy of Family Physicians.       \\\"When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of  care they are able to provide to their patients,\\\" said HRSA Administrator  Robert G.

Further proof : might be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requests : for sufficient fire power.  :  : Important dates:  : Feb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban. : Feb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked.     :  : On Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon : ban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senate : in N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to have : an Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons stated : agenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or : some: group with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were : initially : at the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent  : on \\\"Street Stories\\\" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to \\\"get  : ready fast\\\", as \\\"they know we are coming\\\". I believe this attack continued,  : even tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top  : down.

Otherwise, the key  management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system  unworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place at the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in  their data base?  This means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key  algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is  rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the feds are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that  could break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.     As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to ban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. Their contention that they  need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likely is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont  have the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q&A session, they talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed. They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without  court order even though tapping a phone line requires one. Also pick up on  their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we'll ban strong crypto outright?

Both the \\\"External Tank\\\" and \\\"Wingless Orbiter\\\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign options list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports that O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have been dropped, such as using the \\\"giant external fuel tanks used in launching space shuttles,\\\" and building a \\\"station around an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\\\"  Currently, there are three options being considered, as presented to the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in today's Times).  Option \\\"A\\\" - Low Cost Modular Approach This option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside, there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting the SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and Reston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective teams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this option are:   -  Uses \\\"Bus-1\\\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's      qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C      Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this      for the Air Force.   -  A \\\"Power Station Capability\\\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.      SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle      flies in an \\\"arrow mode\\\" to optimize the microgravity environment.      Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power      source for 30 day missions.   -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term      of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the      US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing      SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International      Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The      Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.      The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.   -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and      add another 20 kW of power   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,      the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return      Vehicle).  Option \\\"B\\\" - Space Station Freedom Derived The Option \\\"B\\\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin. This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we have all come to know and love :)  This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for use on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \\\"A\\\"). Also, the  number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit, for both options \\\"A\\\" and \\\"B\\\".  The build-up occurs in six phases:   -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power      is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when      it visits.   -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist      language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is      deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by      keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes      there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the      second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).   -  A \\\"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\\\" is achieved after 14 flights,      with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal      control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.   -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,      the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the      assembly in 24 flights.  Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option,  with the exception of the data management system, which has major changes.\",\"The actual algorithm is classified, however, their main thrust here is for cellular phones, and encryption is only over the radio end, not end to end, I think.

It is stressed in appeal that the experience of five-years of fighting for independence from imperial chains shows a grim process . The war against Azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of  the Armenians of Ukhari (Upper) Garabag, has meant the destruction of Azeri villages and towns, occupation of 10 percent of the territory, 60 thousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place. This is all the price of fighting for liberty from Russian imperial rule, is said in the document.     Azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make every effort to inform the people of the world about the truth in Azerbaijan, and to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state.    It is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine, food, experienced doctors and financial help to settle refugees from Kelbajar, Fizuli and Lachin regions, and to render medical aid for the  sick and the wounded men.--O--   60 REFUGEES FROM KELBAJAR PERISHED IN THEIR ESCAPE LORRIES        BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today, during the evacuation from Kelbajar region, 60 refugees on board two lorries were killed in the fire from the Armenian Tanks on the only road to leave Kelbajar. According to press -service of Azerbaijan president, no one survived the tragedy. --O--   SITUATION IN THE REGION OF KELBAJAR     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attempts to evacuate the rest of 15,000 citizens, encircled on alpine villages of the region of Kelbajar  went on within the last twenty-four hours. Evacuation helicopters could not land near these villages because of shelling from the Armenian side and existence of fog. Measures are undertaken to air-drop food and medicine to the encircled people.    Several hundred people succeed within the last twenty-four hours to get out of the region of Kelbajar via mountain range. Refugees are  settled in the neighboring regions of Azerbaijan and in Ganja.  Authorities face serious problem with rendering refugees medical  aid and food. The number of refugees from Kelbajar is over 40,000 people. Azerbaijan is not capable of handling a disaster of this magnitude.--0--   ARMENIAN ARMY CONTINUES ATTACK ON FIZULI     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: The region of Fizuli of Azerbaijan,  situated outside of the territory of Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag, has been subjected to heaviest attacks of Armenian army for the fourth day. About 30 armored technique and more than 500 soldiers of the enemy are taking part in the attack.    Armenian units broke the defence line of the azeri forces and occupied the ruling height from where the town is shelled from \\\"Grad\\\" installations, this morning. There is heavy destructions in the town and more than 20 people are dead. Population of the town is hastily evacuated.--0--   PRESS-CONFERENCE OF THE CHIEF OF PRESS-SERVICE OF PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Fifty-five thousand refugees from the region of Kelbajar were taken out by 11 o'clock on April 5, informed the chief of the press-service of president of Azerbaijan, Arif Aliev, today.    Journalists were also informed at the press-conference that International Red Cross is helping to accept and render refugees medical aid. There is an urgent need to supply the refugees with tents, food and medical aid.    Arif Aliev informed that as a result of the ongoing tragedy brought on by the latest aggression of Armenia, the leadership of Azerbaijan intends to appeal to Azerbaijanis and all those who treasure human life all over the world for help.    Concerning the reaction of the international community to aggression  of Armenia, Aliev said the department of state of the USA has expressed its anxiety to leadership of Armenia.

Ambassador of Azerbaijan in Moscow, Hikmet Haji-zade classified this action as provocation aimed at creating a further inter-ethnic conflict in Azerbaijan. He marked in his talk with the Turan correspondent that he does not rule out a connection between the Armenian aggression in the region of Kelbajar and this anti- azerbaijani action of the \\\"Sadval\\\" society in Moscow. He also marked that 30-40 people do not mean the Lezghian nationality in the whole.

In the result of undertaken measures, 6 tanks and a number of  the attackers were destroyed. Advance units of the Armenian army retreated several kilometers.

It is stated in the statement that regular units of the armed forces of Armenia captured the town of Kelbajar on April 3 .   Attack of Armenian units, which began on March 27 deep in the territory of Azerbaijan still continues. Armenia has occupied at present 7500 sq.km of the territory of Azerbaijan.    Spreading of Armenian aggression far away from Ukhari (Upper) Garabag proves that the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflicts has entered a specially dangerous phase. This is the result of non-recognition of  Armenia as an aggressor by the international community, is marked in the document.    It is stressed in the statement that the units of the 7th Russian army are participating in the Armenian attack. This casts doubt on the sincerity of Russian mediation efforts in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict.    It is marked in conclusion that aggressive actions of Armenia  have wrecked the negotiation process under aegis of CSCE.    The document contains the appeal to the world community to stop Armenian aggression and to use political and economic sanctions against the aggressor.--0--   Serdar Argic\",\" I don't think such a Canada is any more \\\"culturally similar\\\" to the United States than England.

Actually, they do not have \\\"roughly the same... urban economy\\\",  and extremely different ethnic composition.   However, if you account for economic and ethnic differences, the difference disappears completely: Seattle's minorities are predominatly poor, while Vancouver's are middle or upper class. The rates for whites in both cities were found to be identicle, while the rate for poor, Seattle minorities was almost three times as great as for the well-to-do minorities of Vancouver. The pattern seems to be one of poverty and race relations, not one of gun control.   That is a gross distortion: \\\"Self-defense\\\" does not mean killing the attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their  attacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that 0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every case you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence where the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed. (0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure, based on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000 crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other  studies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000. Those figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences involve killing the attacker.)   So, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000)  cases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted in the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, in comparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicides make up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study considered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides prevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not be close to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.\",\"For sale 1988 Kawasaki EX-500 with 6682 miles. Excellent condition. Kept in a garage.

If they get caught, there is no punishment  at all.  In the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping  with a good-sized belt, and then taken into some hospital to see first hand  what kind of damage such accidents cause.   Of course this doesn't happen  any more.  That whipping would probably save the kid's life by teaching  him some respect for others.  A person with that little respect would  inevitably wind up dead early anyway.     The problem is creeping gradualism.  If you put a frog into hot water,  he just jumps out.  But if you put him into cold water and then ever-so-  gradually heat it, the frog will cook.  This is what the entertainment  industry and lack of religious, moral, and educational standards in our  modern North American society have done to us over the years.  Now that  we are about to be 'cooked', we may have woken up too late.  #> #>Erik velapold #  #Society, as we have known it, it coming apart at the seams! The basic reason #is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is #\\\"No Big Deal\\\". Kid's see hundreds on murderous acts on TV, we can abort  #children on demand, and kill the sick and old at will. So why be surprised #when some kids drop 20 lbs rocks and kill people. They don't care because the #message they hear is \\\"Life is Cheap\\\"!    And the education system and the Religious Leaders aren't doing much   about it, either.  With both parents working in this society, where is  the stabilizing influence at home?   Latchkey children are everywhere!  And these latchkey kids can watch whatever rotten videos and listen to  whatever violent hate-promoting \\\"music\\\" and videos they like because no  one is home to stop it.    This day and age, when there is about 100 times more things to learn  than when I went to school, our answer to this increased knowledge is  shorter school hours and more leisure time!  I say keep the kids in  school longer, feed them good food and teach them something, and when  they get home, have a parent there to interact and monitor them.  There  is a very old and now forgotten proverb: a child left on his own will  bring a parent to grief.  Daycare systems are not the answer.  This is  just shifting the parents' own responsibilities off on someone else to  whom it's not a life-long committment, but rather just a job.   #  #AT    Followups should go to alt.parents-teens    Fred W.

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.    Contents:  * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key? * What references can I start with to learn cryptology? * How does one go about cryptanalysis? * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance? * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem? * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice? * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are   relatively easy to break?   * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?    The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted   acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A   by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone   who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.    A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so   that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is   the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art   of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when   you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both   cryptography and cryptanalysis.    The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is   called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert   plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert   ciphertext into plaintext.    A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The   algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,   Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different   values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.    The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are   called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,   eavesdroppers, or third parties.  * What references can I start with to learn cryptology?    For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given   in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,   concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,   these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has   developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and   mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is   encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up   to the mid-60's.    Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or   Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want   to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common   mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.    The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of   many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently   several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The   book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range   of security including encryption algorithms, database security,   access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments   apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].    The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite   technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in   the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of   DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses   of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on   modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management   and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and   networks.    The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on   the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.  * How does one go about cryptanalysis?    Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of   analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern   finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available   textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series   [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for   the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given   systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the   cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still   classified.    Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,   or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare   of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the   most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.  * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?    In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can   find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.    Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding   ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the   plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or   decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.   Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this   brute-force search is impractical.        Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered   practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years   now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with   this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the   mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic   decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel   machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.   Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].    One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a   brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.  * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?    The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key   rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.    A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The   unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of   ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and   if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount   of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is   probably strong.    A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears   random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).        A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A   system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.    If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily   strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.   However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is   strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then   he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring   integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.  * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?    Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical   cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your   ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might   assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is   correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the   rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same   plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus   he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he   doesn't have a chance.    Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,   for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even   chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into   the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See   [KAH67].    * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are   relatively easy to break?\",\" Ok.  I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache. It's small enough that I will attach it.  I have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB cache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to 40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective difference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache card certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously better.  I do not have an FPU.  The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference between 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for well under $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it.  If you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I'd like to see them.  Let's check the conventional wisdom!  The so called \\\"Performance Rating\\\" numbers by themselves are of no interest.   Cheers.

They just become very sad and try to figure out what they did wrong. -Dave Barry\",\" First by his fruits.  The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peace based on Godism.  The messiah's teachings will build on the foundation of the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God, the fall of man, the purpose of creation, and God's providence of restoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the World's religions.  Many Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they may miss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000 years ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewish people of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said that John the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)  Later in prison John even questioned who Jesus was: \\\"is he the one who is to come or do we look for another\\\". (see book of Matthew)   David Koresh didn't even come close.  The problem is that people like this make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real Messiah when he does show up.   Very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for Christians: How to recognize the Second Coming?  The Messiah should not claim to be God.  What sets a Messiah apart is that he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect but achieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were born sinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take God thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God originally intended.  God's restoration providence is still not complete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, God's representative on the earth, but not God himself.  There is only one God.  ...    Who else in this world is claiming to be the Messiah.  Maybe he's already here.\",\"It worked!!! Thank you very much! \",\" My least favorite last line of a post.  Um, it is of general interest.

He is walking and saying something, and the children behind him are shouting, \\\"Tear the Armenians to pieces!\\\" and  \\\"Down with the Armenians!\\\" They shout it again, and then shout, \\\"Hurrah!\\\" The  people streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I  saw that there were women, too. I say, \\\"My God, there are women there too!\\\"  And my son says, \\\"Those aren't women, Mamma, those are bad women.\\\" Well we  didn't look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I  simply couldn't sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani  neighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, \\\"Khalida, what's going on, what  happened?\\\" She says, \\\"Emma, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what  happened.\\\" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks,  each second or third one had a white rod. They're waving the rods above their  heads as they walk, and the one who's out front, like a leader, he has a white stick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I  don't know.  My husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, \\\"Oh  dear, I'm frightened, they're going to kill us I bet.\\\" And he says, \\\"What are  you afraid of, they're just children.\\\" I say, \\\"Everything that happens comes  from children.\\\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and  Vocational School. \\\"Don't fear,\\\" he said, \\\"it's nothing, nothing all that  bad.\\\" He didn't eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they broadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran.  When I heard that I couldn't settle down at all, I kept walking here and  there and I said, \\\"They're going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to  kill us.\\\" And he says, \\\"Don't be afraid.\\\" Then we heard--from the central  square, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they're shouting different things, and you couldn't hear every well. I say, \\\"You speak Azerbaijani well, listen to what they're saying.\\\" He says \\\"Close the window and go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\\\" He listened a bit and then  closed the window and went to bed, and told us, \\\"Come on, go to sleep, it's nothing.\\\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window until two in the morning watching. Well he's sick, and all of this was affecting him. I say, \\\"Igor, you go to bed, I'm going to go to bed in a minute too.\\\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed.  Things had calmed down slightly.  The 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \\\"Come on, Emma,  get up.\\\" I say, \\\"Today's my day off, let me rest.\\\" He says, \\\"Aren't you going  to make me some tea?\\\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \\\"Where are  you going?\\\" He says, \\\"I'm going out, I have to.\\\" I say, \\\"Can you really go  outside on a day like today? Don't go out, for God's sake. You never listen to me, I know, and you're not going to listen to me now, but at least don't take  the car out of the garage, go without the car.\\\" And he says, \\\"Come on, close  the door!\\\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn't make it out, he probably said \\\"coward\\\" or something.  I closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up around the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after- noon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said, \\\"Khalida, was it our car?\\\" She says, \\\"No, no, Emma, don't be afraid, they were government cars and Zhigulis.'' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited, it was four o'clock, five o'clock . . . and when he wasn't home at seven I said, \\\"Oh, they've killed Shagen!\\\"  Tires are burning in town, there's black smoke in town, and I'm afraid, I'm  standing on the balcony and I'm all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God,  they've probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten  o'clock and he still hadn't come home. And I'm afraid to go out. At ten o'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore, and from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside.  I'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I  don't want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn't want me to see  it. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \\\"Mamma,\\\" he says, \\\"look what they're doing over there!\\\" They were burning everything, and there  were police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing  on the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are  throwing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony  is shouting, \\\"What are you standing there for, burn it!\\\" When they threw the  television, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out  on her balcony and shouted, \\\"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those things, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their  home. Why are you burning them?\\\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \\\"Go  inside, go inside! Instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in  your building or not?\\\" They meant Armenians, but they didn't say Armenians,  they said, \\\"of them.\\\" She says, \\\"No, no, no, none!\\\" Then she ran downstairs to our place, and says, \\\"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\\\" I say, \\\"They've killed Shagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won't be living for me without  Shagen. Let them kill us, too!\\\" She insists, saying, \\\"Emma, get out of here,  go to Khalida's, and give me the key. When they come I'll say that it's my  daughter's apartment, that they're off visiting someone.\\\" I gave her the key  and went to the neighbor's, but I couldn't endure it. I say, \\\"Igor, you stay  here, I'm going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa's . . . Papa's there.\\\"  Meanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and  Valery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in  the courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they're shouting, howling,  and I didn't think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived in the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw an Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \\\"Madar,  Uncle Shagen's gone, let's go see, maybe he's dead in the garage or near the  garage, let's at least bring the corpse into the house. \\\"He shouts, \\\"Aunt  Emma, where do you think you're going?! Go back into the house, I'll look for  him.\\\" I say, \\\"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar,  I'm coming too.\\\" Well he wouldn't let me go all the same, he says, \\\"You stay  here with us, I'm go look.\\\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \\\"Aunt  Emma, there's no one there, the garage is closed. \\\"Madar went off again and  then returned and said, \\\"Aunt Emma, they're already killed Alik, and Valery's  there . . . wheezing.\\\"  Madar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \\\"Don't go near him,  or we'll put you next to him.\\\" He got scared--he's young--and came back and  said, \\\"I'm going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take  Alik, maybe he'll live . . . \\\" They grew up together in our courtyard, they  knew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but not a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and  called, and called, and called--nothing.  I went upstairs to the neighbor's. Igor says, \\\"Two police cars drove up over  there, their headlights are on, but they're not touching them, they are still  lying where they were, they're still lying there . . . \\\"We watched out the window until four o'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn't take my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six o'clock in the morning I got up and said, \\\"Igor, you stay here at home, don't go out, don't go anywhere, I'm going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or alive . . . let me go . . . I've got the keys from work.\\\"  At six o'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another  doctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, \\\"Doctor, is  Shagen there?\\\" He says, \\\"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\\\" I  wanted to go in, but he wouldn't let me. There were only four people in there, they said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn't let me in. They said, \\\"Shagen's not here, he's alive somewhere, he'll come back.\\\"  It's already seven o'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck with three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with them. I say, \\\"Sara Baji [\\\"Sister\\\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they've probably brought Shagen.\\\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back and says, \\\"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it's a younger person.\\\" Now Shagen  just happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they  said it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \\\"Doctor, they've  brought Shagen in dead.\\\" He says, \\\"Why are you carrying on like that, dead,  dead . . . he's alive.\\\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back  the look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They knew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \\\"Doctor,  is it Shagen?\\\" He says, \\\"No, Emma, it's not he, it's somebody else entirely.\\\"  I say, \\\"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I'll find out all the same anyway,  if not today, then tomorrow.\\\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the office. He says, \\\"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\\\" Another one of our  colleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous  condition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn't Shagen. A few minutes  later another colleague comes in and says, \\\"Oh, poor Emma!\\\" When she said it  like that there was no hope left.     That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured  people.  At night someone took me home. I said, \\\"Igor, Papa's been killed.\\\"  On the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital:  I had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is  surrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. \\\"Hey, citizen, where  are you going?\\\" I say, \\\"I work here,\\\" and from inside someone shouts, \\\"Yes,  yes, that's our cook, let her in.\\\" I went right to the head doctor's office and there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to work with us at the hospital. He says, \\\"Emma, Shagen's been taken to Baku. In the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\\\" I say, \\\"Doctor, how will I bury him?\\\" He says, \\\"We're taking care of all that, don't you worry, we'll do everything, we'll tell you about it. Where did you spend the night?\\\" I say, \\\"I was at home.\\\" He says, \\\"What do you mean you were at home?! You were at home alone?\\\" I say, \\\"No, Igor was there too.\\\" He says, \\\"You can't stay home, we're getting an ambulance right now, wait just one second, the head doctor is coming, we're arranging an ambulance right now, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here like a patient, and you'll stay here and we'll se~ later what to do next ...\\\" His last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor's name is Izyat Jamalogli Sadukhov.  The \\\"ambulance\\\" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a  patient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the  hospital until the 4th.  Some police car came and they said, \\\"Emma, let's go.\\\" And the women, our  colleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, \\\"Where are  you taking her?\\\" I say, \\\"They're going to kill me, too . . . \\\" And the investigator says, \\\"Why are you saying that, we're going to make a positive identification.\\\" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I still can't remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \\\"Let's  go, we need to be certain, maybe it's not Shagen.\\\" And when I saw the caskets, lying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, \\\"I can't look, no.\\\" The investigator says, \\\"Are there any identifying marks?\\\" I say, \\\"Let me see the clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I'll recognize them.\\\" He says,  \\\"Isn't they're anything on his body?\\\" I say he has seven gold teeth and his  finger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had been injured at work . . .  They brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they  brought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, \\\"Oh,  they burned him!\\\" I shouted, I don't know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat  down, I don't remember. And that investigator says, \\\"Well fine, fine, since  we've identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since he has seven gold teeth . . . \\\"  On the 4th they told me: \\\"Emma, it's time to bury Shagen now.\\\" I cried, \\\"How,  how can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he's sick? I should inform  his relatives, he has three sisters, I can't do it by myself.\\\" They say, \\\"OK,  you know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they  get here from Yerevan? There's no transportation, it s impossible.\\\"  He was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in  Sumgait. They asked me, \\\"Where do you want to bury him?\\\" I said, \\\"I want to  bury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,\\\" I'm  shouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, \\\"Do you know what  it means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!\\\" I say, \\\"What do you mean,  arson? Don't they know what's going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that they killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don't have anyone  anymore.\\\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He says, \\\"Let's bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year,  if it calms down, I'll help you move him to Karabagh . . . \\\"  Our trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the investigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then at the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime.  Then they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said,  \\\"Ismailov, look, is that you?\\\" He says, \\\"Yes.\\\" \\\"Well look, here you're  describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\\\" He says,  \\\"Yes.\\\" \\\"And now you're telling it differently?\\\" He says, \\\"Well maybe I  forgot!\\\" Like that.  The witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going along Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a  Volga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were  involved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it's unclear who--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side of the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports  jacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \\\"What's your nationality?\\\" He  says, \\\"Armenian.\\\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \\\"If he's an Armenian, kill him, kill him!\\\" They started beating him, they broke seven of his ribs, and his heart . . . I don't know, they did something there, too  . . . it's too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he  had an armature shaft. He says, \\\"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush,  that's where I got it.\\\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he had already had it. He said, \\\"I hit him twice,\\\" he said, \\\" . . . once or twice on the head with that rod.\\\" And he said that when he started to beat him  Shagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said,  \\\"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment, killing someone,\\\" he says, \\\"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or not?\\\" I said, \\\"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you came back to hit him again?\\\" He went back and looked and he was already dead. \\\"After that,\\\" that bastard Tale said, \\\"after that I went home.\\\"  I said, \\\"You . . . you . . . little snake,\\\" I said, \\\"Are you a thief and a  murderer?\\\" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They were taken. He says he didn't take them  When they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was other people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned it, that hasn't been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \\\"How can you  have the trial when you don't know who burned the car?\\\" He said something, but I didn't get what he was saying. But I said, \\\"You still haven't straightened  everything out, I think that's unjust.\\\"  When they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him.  In the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80 percent of his body . . .  And I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good  craftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his  own hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the  time. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the  Army. And now they're fatherless...  I couldn't sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15 years' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn't know what to do with myself, I said, \\\"How can that be? You,\\\" I said, \\\"you are  saying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years'  deprivation of freedom?\\\" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, \\\"Let me at that creep, with my bare hands I'll . . . \\\" A relative restrained me, and there were all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,\\\" This isn't a  Soviet trial, this is unjust!\\\" That's what I shouted, l said it and left . . .  I said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street,  they were shouting, \\\"Long live Turkey!\\\" and \\\"Glory to Turkey!\\\" And during the  trial I said to that Ismailov, \\\"What does that mean, 'Glory to Turkey'?\\\" I  still don't understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet  Union. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I still don't understand why \\\"Glory to Turkey!\\\" I asked that question twice and got no answer . . . No one answered me . . .

Surveys have shown while the public thinks certain types of gun control may be acceptable they do believe they have an individual right to keep and bear arms, and that the police should not have /discretion/ over who may and may not own firearms.

Legally or illegally, American's will keep their firearms. The number of unregistered weapons in New York City is in the millions. There aren't even close to that number of violent criminals there.   If the gov't was serious about stopping violent crime they would keep violent criminals in jail for a long long time where they belong instead of letting them out on early release.

I spoke to the pastor of my parish (Catholic) recently,  by coincidence, on this subject.  His explaination was that  while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the  Church as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church  recoginizes itself as a community of believers, members of the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable to each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island, there are many places in the world that do not have priests availible for marriages on a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without the priest being present, but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one comes through the area.     I remember a religion teacher in high school saying that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple as much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus, married couples have some responsibility to the community to stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the community.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with one another--the community should be able to rely on that  couple to be as one.   While couples may marry without witnesses, they  may NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An  anulment is simply an admission of the church that what they had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage at all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves anulments a half-hour later!!   I tend to agree with the response back there that said couples become married as soon as they consumate their marriage, but I would add that couples should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they intended to be married, assuming they were both willing partners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared to raise any children they may have as a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a commitment, I believe, in God's eyes.

This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are  conceivable but not observed to exist, does this mean that we would have  to believe in all of them?  According to the above poster, we must believe  in objects or beings that haven't been proved not to exist so why stop at  God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan  except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond  hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can't see them)  The   reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians  have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.    How did they shoot themselves in the foot?     There is a big difference here, Stalin didn't say that he stood for a    particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism, etc.) and   then did the opposite (like the religious movements), he was at least   an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this   viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because   one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the   russians that helped Stalin that weren't atheists - don't they contradict   your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant   to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists   can't value life as much as theists (which you didn't support).      Ah, and here's another point you didn't get out of the FAQ.  An atheist  doesn't have to hold the positive view that god doesn't exist, he/she may  just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here's the example:    Strong atheism - \\\"I believe god does not exist\\\"   a positive belief   Weak atheism   - \\\"I don't believe in a god\\\"       a negative belief    these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of  god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that  you are calling unreasonable.  Or let's look at it this way (in sets)    suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent  as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas  exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person  not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that  even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:    christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god    atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)    atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set    agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E', ....)      Nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not   will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always    prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival   trait, evolution has drilled it in us to take positions, even false ones.  \",\"   Why do we follow God so blindly?  Have you ever asked a physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog? The answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind person cannot.   I acknowledge, as a Christian, that I am blind.  I see, but I see  illusions as well as reality.  (Watched TV lately?) I hear, but I hear lies as well as truth.  (Listen to your  radio or read a newspaper.)  Remember, all that tastes well is not healthy.  So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, and taste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not. That is God.   Of course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses, how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or a lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must force ourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves us enough to share it with us, even when it defies what we think we know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us  enough to help us through this world?   I also do trust my experiences to some extent.  When I do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience,  because it is what my Father commands me to do, and I see the results in the long term, I find that He has led me in the proper direction, even though it did not feel right at the time.  This is where our works as Christians are important:  As exercises of the body make the body strong, excercises of faith make the faith strong.     As for you, no one can \\\"convert\\\" you.  You must choose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever to follow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share with you the love we have received from God.  If you reject that, we have to accept your decision, although we always keep the offer open to you.  If you really want to find out why we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try praying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians about their experiences personally.  Then you may grow to understand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the logic of this world.   May the Lord bring peace to you, \",\"(reference line trimmed)    Well, I'd say that a murderer is one who intentionally committed a murder. For instance, if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain blanks, and someone was killed with such a gun, the person who actually performed the action isn't the murderer (but I guess this is actually made clear in the below definition).   What do you mean by \\\"reasonable?\\\"  [...]  Yes, it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition.  But, even though the series is recursively infinite, I think the meaning can still be deduced.   [math lesson deleted]  Okay, let's look at this situation:  suppose there is a longstanding feud between two families which claim that the other committed some travesty in the distant past.  Each time a member of the one family kills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justified in killing a that member of the first family.  Now, let's suppose that this sequence has occurred an infinite number of times.  Or, if you don't like dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the family goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing.  That is, there is a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty. How do you resolve this?  Well, they are all murders.  Now, I suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your \\\"problem,\\\" but it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.  And, in any case, the nested \\\"murderer\\\" in the definition of murder cannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity. And, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved.  So, the first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily a murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition?  See, in a totally objective system where all the information is available, such a nested definition isn't really a problem.\",\"   Well the attorneys of the Davidians reported on Larry King that the tanks had actually damaged the structure to the extent that effectuating egress from the building was difficult at best. With a rapidly spreading fire and large amounts of smoke and tear gas, finding the right exits, or acceptible holes in the walls were nearly impossible.  I find this explanation to be completely  plausible.  Doesn't mean that it's true, but I don't find it intrinsically less believable than the government stories.    I concur.   Indeed.  According to the lawyers, the Davidian survivors say that lanterns were knocked over during the \\\"probing\\\" and that's how the fire started.  A tragic accident, if true.    See above.  This one is going to be thoroughly investigated.  Maybe we'll eventually get some idea of what happened.  My view is that, from beginning to end, this operation was a botch and that it is completely possible that nut cases who were otherwise law-abiding citizens were victims of a bureaucratic execution. --  paul hager  hagerp@moose.cs.indiana.edu\",\" I am not so sure of Jewish proselytism then, but I would like to relate an account of a recent dinner I had with Jews a few months ago.  The dinner was instigated by the aunt of the hostess, whom I had met while visiting my wife in Galveston last October.  The dear old aunt (now  deceased) was very proud of her Jewish heritage, although not especially devout.  Her parents were both murdered in Nazi concentration camps in Austria during WWII because they were Jewish.  While conversing with her about politics, world affairs and religion, she remarked that it would  be a good idea for me to visit her niece on my return to Atlanta.  Within two days of returning to Atlanta, her niece called to invite me over for dinner with her husband.  I went, not knowing really what to expect, other than stimulating conversation and fellowship.  What I got, however, was rather unexpected.  The thrust of the evening's discussion was to condemn the Reagan-Bush policies prohibiting abortion counseling  in federally funded family planning clinics, prohibiting the sterilization of minorities on welfare here and in Puerto Rico, on the ban on fetal tissue research, and against the Mexico City policy, \\\"which denies U.S. foreign aid to programs overseas that promote abortion.\\\"  The crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of \\\"overpopulation,\\\" rampant domestic crime, African starvation, unwed mothers, etc., on Christianity, rather on the fall of Adam.  Now, this is not what I had to come to talk about.  But every time I tried to  bring up the subject of Judaism, they would condemn Jews for Jesus and admonish me against converting to Judaism, \\\"because it involves too much study and effort.\\\"  And I did not even raise the prospect, nor try to convert them to the truth of Christ!  There was certainly no Jewish proselytism going on there.  And again, last November I toured a \\\"traditional\\\" Jewish synagogue and was subjected to a 30-minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity in general.  I realize that these are two isolated incidents, and that the best supervisor I ever had at work is Jewish, but from my experience, the modern Jew is not known for his proselytism.    --  boundary\",\"Regards, Steve.\",\"    I won't argue too much about anything.  I am probably one of those that  think that we can't have enough safety on the roads.  I would gladly  sacrifice distractions (as you call it), than someone having trouble seeing danger earlier.

Someone died because I was too stingy to put on my lights.         The ratio of the probability of fallen trees/rocks on the roads to  oncoming traffic is too low to even be considered.

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\"   (See also Map 1.

True? False? What?  Have there been any important and documented investigations into homeopathic principles?  I was reading a book on homeopathy over the weekend. I turned to the section on the principles behind homeopathic medicine, and two paragraphs informed me that homeopaths don't feel obliged to provide any sort of explanation. The author stated this with pride, as though it were some sort of virtue! Why am I sceptical about homeopathy? Is it because I am a narrow-minded bigot, or is it because homeopathy really looks more like witch-doctory than anything else?\",\"Maddi Hausmann chirps:     That's nice.

A lot of older minis used it.  Sun still does on their server models.  There are several different speeds of SMD, and I think that the  Fuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec (thats megabits).  There used to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase in Texas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up. Controllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses though.  Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available, but I think that it was designed for slower SMD devices.

And, much as it discomforts us, in humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and cranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do. Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea: my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great- grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife had each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great- grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous farmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of childbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota, contain quite a few gravestones like \\\"Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and baby, May 6, 1853.\\\"   More like one in ten.  And the consequences can be devastating; I have direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth.   It isn't always fatal.  But it is often fatal, when it happens out of reach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.  Clearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine design); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.     My, aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack in months!  I can practically see your mouth foam.  We're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  Although I can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked them up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks. I wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly indicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting until an emergency to give in.  And bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions. We talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main decisions were really hers.   I don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that a first-time mother should have her baby at home.   But people should bother to find out the relative risks.  My wife was unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings. In view of the intensity of the birth experience, I doubt surroundings have much importance anyway.  Somehow the values you're advocating seem all lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious permanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all, an esthetic consideration.\",\":  : What are the current products available to upgrade the resolution? : Which ones support postscript? :  : Any experiences with them, either good or bad? :  : Is the quality difference really noticable? :  : I'm planning on producing camera ready copy of homes.  Will the higher : resolution be noticed for these? :  If you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript. I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language that is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript. It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower resolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product uses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation processed PS.  The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.  We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's demo though).  I don't know how many other similar products are out there but I would be surprised if there are several.\",\"   I found the MS defrag looks very much like Norton Speedisk.

Jake.\",\"Being a parent in need of some help, I ask that you bear with me while I describe the situation which plagues me...  I am a divorced father. Chance would have it that \\\"my weekend\\\" with my  daughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.  Although I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decided that the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith was too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a date), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.  During the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church.   When our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she  be baptised as Catholic. This wasn't a problem with me.  During a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease that affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward for two months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated \\\"effectively\\\".  In other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.  During the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over my daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday visitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study books to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.  Last fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings. At that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time, I started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend. I did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a religious community.  Today, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for  Communion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine (The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the pew in front of us.  I feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her religious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments if you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.  My daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and mature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly for religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with my daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.  My initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith in Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays with her again.  I do not want to \\\"drive her from the fold\\\", and would be willing to allow her to continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only for two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.  Any suggestions?  If you have a response, please e-mail me a copy. (I'm not a regular reader of this newsgroup.) (Naturally, feel free to post too!)  Thanks, and I hope you've had a happy Easter.

They say the 39-year-old mechanic committed suicide after     killing his wife, Jocelyne Parent, 31.       The couple had been separated for a month and the woman had     gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money     for food. A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked     his wife with a kitchen knife, cutting her throat, police said.       She was only the latest of 13 women slain by a husband or     lover in Quebec in the last five weeks.       Five children have also been slain as a result of the same     domestic \\\"battles.\\\"       Last year in Quebec alone, 29 [women] were slain by their     husbands.

Yesterday I counted and realized that on seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at this company.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one; someone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.  I'm really upset by this.

To make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to treat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for leaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go to the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one could be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my number was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a neutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite the fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being left in my desk drawer.  I need some prayers --- I can't stop crying. I am so deeply wounded that it's ridiculous.  I feel like I'm some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feel like I'm a sub-human piece of garbage that's not worthy of a simple phone call saying \\\"We're leaving for Mary's lunch a little early so that Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting...\\\"  Please pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously turned into something positive.  Please pray that whoever is torturing me so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. Please pray for my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a whole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new job in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such harrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This company, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment isn't tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one female engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or threatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven times in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company do me no good when I'm terrified or healing from the latest assault.)  And please pray that I don't turn into an automaton because of this. That's my bad habit: \\\"ignore it and it will go away\\\", \\\"you're not worth anyone's time so don't go talking to anyone about this\\\", \\\"you're right, you are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this way\\\", \\\"you are just an object\\\", \\\"you prostitute your mind to this company so why can't others expect you to prostitute your body there as well?\\\", \\\"what makes you think women aren't just possessions, and nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?\\\" This is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major depressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don't come into my head and stay there, triggering depression.  Please pray that this latest trauma doesn't come between me and God. In a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to God, and it's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can separate one mentally from God.  (I know God doesn't drop me from his loving hand, but it's awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the hand, look down, think I'm falling and forget that God's still holding on to me.)  Although this probably isn't entirely appropriate for this newsgroup, I really can use the kind of loving support you all provide.  For this reason I hope good Mr. Moderator allows me this latest indulgence.  After all, he's allowed me the thermometer note, and a few other off-the-wall topics.  Thanks in advance to everyone for your support and prayers.  Peace to you, Esther \",\" -- and --   Good grief; has no one ever heard of Biostatistics??  The University of Washington (plus 3 or 4 others [Harvard, UNC]) has a department and advanced degree program in Biostatistics.  My wife has an MS Biostat, and there are plenty of MDs, PhDs, and postdocs doing Biostatistical work. People do this for a living.  Really bright people study for decades to do this sort of study well.  Anecedotal evidence is worthless.  Even doctors who have been using a drug or treatment for years, and who swear it is effective, are often suprised at the results of clinical trials.  Whether or not MSG causes describable, reportable, documentable symptoms should be pretty simple to discover.    The last study on which my wife worked employed 200 nurses, 100 doctors, and a dozen Ph.Ds at one University and at 70 hospitals in five nations.  I would think the MSG question could be settled by one lowly Biostat MS student in a thesis.\",\" Let's see, if Alexander destroyed Tyre, and people move back, and they construct houses, and after a while 14000 people live there and still call it Tyre, it is not considered to be rebuilt. Instead it's considered to be 'just-some-people-that-got-together-for-fishing- and-they-needed-houses' place.   Sigh, I was never born in a city then (my home town has 10.000 people). I have to consult my city and inform them that it's from now a fishing village. When this city (Kristinestad) was founded in the 17:th century about 1000 people lived there, so the norms were even more bizarre for dumb Swedish queens who founded cities along the coast of Finland.  I would like to know why Paul thought is was worth mentioning the  small fishing place of Tyre in Acts. Again, maybe he was a keen fisherman and wanted to visit the shores of Tyre? :-)  Cheers, Kent\",\"  >    I realize I'm entering this discussion rather late, but I do  > have one question.

Sigh.  Another naive illusion down the toilet....      ----- Tommy McGuire mcguire@cs.utexas.edu mcguire@austin.ibm.com\",\" That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.  If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast, DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.  Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee can and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified later against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some secure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without it being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again. (Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee members can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which you have to XOR together to recover the program...  Seriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the people who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game and the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not going to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility is the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied about the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence of other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will believe that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys. If they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem, no one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.  That isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things anyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem with a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took for folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just such reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to a Senator...).   I don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do. However -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same escrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure, they can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.  I still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.  I thought I had seen something about them being constant, but I just reread Denning's technical information post, and it doesn't say anything, one way or the other. \",\" Yes, a point well-taken ... however, even in areas that finally got some games, there's something nagging in the back of your skull when the network that has the national rights in its pocket says on its sports news, \\\"There's an awesome overtime going on in Quebec City, and we'll *try* to get you an update through the show ...\\\" when you know that it's on a satellite's feedhorn somewhere up there ...

(Actually,  Idid see Bryant Gumble bring that point up.  Hee, hee).   \",\" Yes, this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws. However, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all five schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against muslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do not know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and open hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know that historically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone by the death penalty.  My understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the law of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the Qur'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy.  I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \\\"fasad\\\". This ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.   I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book. However, the charge of \\\"fasad\\\" can encompass a number of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that the condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the \\\"crisis\\\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people, not books.  The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz, presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred.  Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this point that the fatwa on \\\"fasad\\\" was issued.  The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The crime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being played out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.\",\" I'll throw in a vote for a Metzler \\\"economy\\\" tire, the ME77.

He threw 2 straight fastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the first one, but Bonds hit the second one out of the park.  Then in the 3rd, when Clark was at third base with one out, Maddux did not intentionally walk Bonds, and Bonds dropped a single to left-center.       The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has not scored a run yet.  He will always hit around .300, but I'm concerning about his on-base percentage.  The key in the lineup is Matt Williams, he has to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base.         The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL.  Burba has done a superb job filling in so far, he looks like a different pitcher from last year.  However, Swift is terrible in both of his starts.  With Burba moving into the rotation, Mike Jackson is the only right-handed reliever aside from Rod Beck, he'll get a lot of actions.  I also hope that Dusty can manage his bullpen better than Roger Craig, especially on Beck. I was concerned when Beck was used for 3 straight days earlier this week.

Having \\\"a few irregular beats\\\" on an EKG could be serious depending on what those beats were and when they occurred, or could be of no significance.  Low blood potassium levels probably predispose people with underlying heart disease to develop arrhythmias.  Very low potassium levels are clearly dangerous, but it is not clear how much of a problem low-end-of-normal levels are:  a lot of cardiologists seem to treat anyone with even a mildly low-normal potassium level. \",\"This is generally called phimosis..usually it is due to an inflammation, and ca n be retracted in the physician's offfice rather eaaasily.

I plan to be at the game on June 28th, they'll have to play him then.  \",\" ------------ Part 8 of 14 ------------ MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AYZ>8=#0T\\\"L!A%(!*]#0T\\\"4E)<-N;@+(U,C(;CZ;1-/3 MTXU*IH?4JH!75\\\\B`P2&((F[JZ$/Q[/&J3;YJ+2WE<\\\"3T*0:4E,SUAX>'AY\\\\* MFYL^/J\\\"@PR4E)=#0T\\\"4E2VY+)1$1D&[4U-34U-34AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX<Y824E%!17@$JN%!1-(;GO?NKHM:=:6FQ* MKNSL\\\\3ND\\\\>QJ+2F'AX>'AX&!UM8DFYL^/CZ@B+40B*`^/IN;FYN;)24E)6%A MT-#0T-!A)25+P\\\\/#-L#`P%L45U?R(>#@AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>$J0&>P'5U=75U M=9Z>`0$!`81VO!-V`2O0)24EPVYN;FYN;FYN;@+(U-3(U-3(R`)N2R70AX>' MAY[/S]0%TZX\\\"P$V^:C#:N(/6C\\\"DP8^$D]-DKGI[0*WA9`8>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX=V$W:\\\"=E(`86&02QVQ?EI::/':C,Q145%1]?51 M8(>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AW6IGIZ>Y7`D*ZE0@R3T]\\\"O-@R0I+=KE<\\\"0I M+2T^K.SLK/&LK/'LL<C4U,@\\\";B70*P&$=A.\\\\=H0!G@$!AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'GH0K*RLK*P%V$Q-V`2LKT\\\"4E M)<-NPP(\\\"R,C(;B4EFT1*2NCHIJ;4JL]75\\\\B`P2&(\\\\6Z`1$/Q[/&J3;YJ+2WE M<\\\"3T*08WS&#UAX>'%X$DFYL^/FYN;FY+)6%A824E2VYN2TN0D$L\\\"U-1KU-34 MU(>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX<!*V$E%!2B@$JN MHA1-(=RQL8!?#,9:?FQ*KNS&\\\\3YD[.QJ+2F'AX>'AX&!@=;6FYN;/CZ@KH@0 MM8B@/CX^/CX^/CX^/IN;FPH*\\\"@H*\\\"@H*\\\"@HD)\\\"0D)\\\"0D2/+R(2'@AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>$=7B>P'5U=75UJ9Z>`0$!A':\\\\$W8!*]!A)25+PVYN`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`LC( MU,C(R`(\\\";L,E)=`KAX>'AX?/5\\\\@%2JYNP$V^L[/:N(,D*3`P8W`D*=DKJ9[0 M*W@'`8>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>\\\"$[R\\\"@@``86'#2\\\\C( M?EI^'60P!F#U]?7U4<P&C\\\"F'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AW6IGIZ>Y7`DT*E0 M@R3T,\\\"OP@R0I+=KE<\\\"3:9\\\"T^K.SL(NRL\\\\>P\\\"U-34U,C(`B4ET\\\"L!O+R$`0$K MT\\\"5U`82'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AW@!GMFI MJ0<'`82\\\\$Q,3O`$KT&$E)25A)6X\\\"R,C4`L-+)3Y$1$3!P:;(JL]75\\\\B`P3NN MK,.J1\\\"'Q[/&J3;YJ+2WE<\\\"3T*0;,8/7UAX?U]8$DFSX^PVYN;F[#2R4E)24E M)4MN;FYND&Y+U-34U&MKU`*'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'A[QV`2MA6Q2BJDJN%%M-(8AH:(#H0QU:[VQ*KNS&\\\\3ZL[,:@9-J'AX>' MAX&!@=;6))N;FSX^H*ZU$+6(H*`^/CX^/CX^/CZ;FR0*\\\"@H*\\\"@H*)\\\"0D)\\\"0D M)\\\"28OO+@(2'@AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX=2=9Z>P'5U=76IGIZ>>'@!`5*$`7B>GG5A M)25+2VYN`@(\\\"`LC(R,C4U,@\\\";DLE8=`K`81VAX>'AX?J5\\\\CI2J!NP$V^LRTM MJJ8DVBTMSG`D*=G0J:G0*WB5O(>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAP%V$[QV4@`K86%+R-3(U%I^'60P!E'U45',E(PPVBUD9(>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AW6>GIZ>Y7`DT-!0@R0I,-#P@R3:9\\\"WE<\\\"3:9\\\"T^K.SL'6CQ;@+4U-34 MU,C(:ULV-MD'4I4'V=G9-FMKP#@!AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>>`0&IJ:F>!Y65>`%24E)24E)XGJFIJ0$K825N`M34R`)NP\\\\/# MIJ9-34W(JM175]3(P3NNK,.J1\\\"&L[*RJ34AJ+=KEX22,]#=@45%1AQ?U]9\\\\* MFR4EPVYN;F[#2R4E)24E)4M+;FX\\\";DM+`FO4U-34U`*'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AQP<.>Y&;EL4JDJN%%M-.XC&:(#H0\\\\9:[VQ* MKNSL\\\\3ZL[&BNK\\\"V'AX>'A];6UB0D))L^FSX^H*Z(M1\\\"UB*Z@/CX^/CX^/CZ;

The bike has about 47,000 miles : and is around $4500. It has had two previous owners, both employees : of the dealership who, I have been told, took very good care of the : bike.  : I have two questions: 1) Is this too many miles for a bike? I know this : would not be many miles for a car but I am unfamiliar with the life : span of bikes. 2) Is this a decent price? I am also unfamilar with : prices for used bikes. Is there a blue book for bikes like there is : for cars?.  : Thanks for any advice you can give.  :                             --Mark --  Mark,    47k is not too many miles on a VFR750.  I sold my (well maintained) '87 VFR700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition. All that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings and seals.  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers to look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was mint.     As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k miles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800. There is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price. I've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all said low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.     A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain it at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my VFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot. Progressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.  Good luck,\",\" Society, as we have known it, it coming apart at the seams!

As published in \\\"US Industrial Outlook 1993\\\"  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be \\\"adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.\\\"                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  \\\"Space Business Indicators\\\" in mid-year, and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year  through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a  planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation, and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request \\\"launch on demand\\\"  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should  provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/\\\"Spacelifter\\\" program.  At this  time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all \\\"ELV upgrade\\\" programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \\\"Spacelifter\\\"  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget  deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \\\"GO-AHEAD\\\"    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture  by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a \\\"Star Wars\\\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists,  agricultural planners, and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last  November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,  government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \\\"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\\\"     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analyst's report Morgan Stanley said \\\"We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.\\\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate  management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,  many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track, this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early  February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane  holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the  decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.     [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and  I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service, but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,  Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their  investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at  lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an  investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column, some of the initial  investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \\\"Aerokosmos\\\"  winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \\\"Severkosmos\\\",  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.     [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new  venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This one's a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.     [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the  Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:   - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore  Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts, former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.     What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B  satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \\\"the main  alternative rocket supplier\\\" for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of \\\"off the shelf\\\" components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,  launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),  headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist  Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the  satellite's communications channels.      [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the  release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \\\"Asiasat- 2\\\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based \\\"Asiasat\\\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and  other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's  aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry, specifically including space  activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \\\"made in Korea.\\\"   Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of  consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+%  of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

This column's already full?  And I still have bunches of  commercial space developments to report on.  As I said at the start  of this, column there's been a lot of interesting happenings - but  I'll have to put them into the next issue.      Looking ahead, I've got several articles in the works on new  happenings with Iridium and the LEO communications satellite market,  more news on international launchers appearing (and disappearing) on  the market, new international commercial space ventures,  and other  interesting developments.

The summary:  CTX 14\\\": Nasty, low quality. Avoid.  CTX 15\\\" Proscan: Not as good as some other makes; however, cheap.   Main problem seems poor quality control.

Origins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human species, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?  2) Science cannot explain origins.  This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends on what origins we are talking about.  3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science.  Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \\\"higher truth\\\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language of science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \\\"higher\\\" or  \\\"lower\\\"; they are simply true.  More to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science does not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the scope of discussion.  4) This is a false premise.  If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false then (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another false [or at least theologically unsound] statement.  5) By the way, I enjoy science.  On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read. However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy, perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.  6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.  Let us not quibble; count this one as true.  7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]  Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification:  \\\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\\\"  -----  It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his personal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.\",\" Nope, you're confusing separate programs.  Atlas was the first-generation US ICBM; Titan I was the second-generation one; Titan II, which all the Titan launchers are based on, was the third-generation heavy ICBM.  There was essentially nothing in common between these three programs.  (Yes, *three* programs.  Despite the similarity of names, Titan I and Titan II were completely different missiles.  They didn't even use the same fuels, never mind the same launch facilities.) \",\"Posting for a friend: please call Steve, 415 252-1618, if interested.  SEGA Genesis games for sale.

And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.\\\" {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]  The notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other texts contradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the Trinity the most likely explanation after all?  But maybe I simply misunderstand their views.  (Is anyone else out there forced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged dictionary??  Christianity really is an education in itself.)  -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian language as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things like \\\"one essense and three persons\\\".  Obviously the three-fold baptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the term \\\"three-fold\\\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly consistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose full formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent's.  It's unlikely that Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine. Indeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do not believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae occurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in the name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as well.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in Mat. to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.  \\\"Jesus only\\\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this consistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I'm not the right one to ask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not appear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of dealing with the idiomatic phrase \\\"in the name of\\\".)  Those who use the three-fold formula don't seem to have a standard answer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus. I suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \\\"in the name of\\\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name of Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus' authority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism with the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there's a certain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we could just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn't require the specific three-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes baptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  One might well suspect that in the early church, more than one baptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to be the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great damage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that I think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of the few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize mutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in the interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that those groups that actually use \\\"in the name of Jesus\\\" now do seem to have in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I've said before, I'm not the one to explain what their doctrine is.\",\"  On a related topic, I have been searching (with no success) for a specification of the Enhanced Metafile format.

The Negev in the Year 2000  Just after the creation of the State of Israel, the phrase \\\"the Jewish pioneers will make the desert bloom\\\" was trumpeted throughout the Western world. After the Six Day War in 1967, David Ben-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle: \\\"It's by our pioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land into a fertile land, created built-up areas, towns and villages in abandoned desert areas\\\".  Contrary to Ben-Gurion's assertion, it must be affirmed that during the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and for centuries previous, a productive human presence was to be found in all parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleys of the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north. These were the Bedouin Arabs.  The real desertification of the Negev, mainly in the southern part, occurred after Israel's dispossession of the Bedouin's cultivated lands and pastures. Nowadays, the majority of the 12,800 square-kilometer Negev, which represents 62 percent of the State of Israel (pre-1967 borders), has been desertified beyond recognition. The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev are the Israeli army; the Nature Reserves Authority, whose chief role is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture lands; and vast industrial zones, including nuclear reactors and dumping grounds for chemical, nuclear and other wastes. Israeli Jews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area cultivated by the Bedouin before 1948, and there is no Jewish pastoral activity.  I. Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin before and after 1948 -------------------------------------------------- In 1942, according to British mandatory statistics, the Beersheba sub-district (which corresponds more or less to Israel's Negev, or Southern, district) had 52,000 inhabitants, almost all Bedouin Arabs, who held 11,500 camels, 6,000 cows and oxen, 42,000 sheep and 22,000 goats.  The majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in the north, where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm per year. In 1944 they cultivated about 200,000 hectares of the Beersheba district - i.e. 16 percent of its total area and *more than double the area cultivated by the Negev's Jewish settlers after 40 years of \\\"making the desert bloom\\\"*  The Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms of barley per hectare during rainy years - and their farming techniques were primitive, but production was based solely on animal and human labor. It must also be underscored that animal production, although low, was based entirely on pasturing. Production increased considerably during the rainy years and diminished significantly during drought years. All Bedouin pasture animals - goats, camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weight quickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many waterless days during the hot summers. These animals were the result of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harsh local conditions.  After the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The 10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of 40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150 mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out of three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev, spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin shepherds from roaming.  A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev. But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields in order that the land could be transferred to the army.  No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized by the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now confined to seven \\\"development towns\\\", or *sowetos*, established for them.\",\"What files do I need to download for GhostScript 2.5.2?

But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only \\\"real solution\\\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both  legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the \\\"internal nerves\\\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd  always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that \\\"force\\\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.  Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\",\"Here is the Colorado Rockies openning day cast:  Pitchers -------- Scott Aldred (L)  MLB Totals  31 games, 6-14, 5.08 ERA, 0 saves Andy Ashby (R)                18 games, 2-8,  6.72 ERA, 0 saves Willie Blair (R)              67 games, 10-15,4.57 ERA, 0 saves Butch Henry (L)               28 games, 6-9,  4.02 ERA, 0 saves Darren Holmes (R)             95 games, 5-9,  4.10 ERA, 9 saves David Neid (R)                 6 games, 3-0,  1.17 ERA, 0 saves Jeff Parrett (R)             341 games, 46-30,3.65 ERA,21 saves Steve Reed (R)                18 games, 1-0,  2.30 ERA, 0 saves Bruce Ruffin (L)             223 games, 43-64,4.31 ERA, 3 saves Bryn Smith (R)               354 games,106-90,3.44 ERA, 6 saves Gary Wayne (L)               147 games, 8-8,  3.44 ERA, 3 saves  The rest\",\"   \",\"Robert C Hite writes  I think the only Phillies in effect here are Philly Blunts.

The cockpit crew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew limits for this reason.  Crew rest requirements address amount of time on duty plus rest time.  A tired crew is an accident-prone crew.  The only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in military aircraft, which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably pressurized.  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members DNIF (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear.  Flying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear.

The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits  for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution.   The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed  unsafe under federal air quality laws.        \\\"People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to  exacerbate that inflammation,\\\" said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental  Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  \\\"When people are on  the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over  the edge.\\\"       The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits  with daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter  of 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because  they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of  compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10  exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.        In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at  levels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30  microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with  asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.        The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory  Disease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung  Association's medical section.        The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that  particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study  by Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles  may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.   Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms  and bronchitis in children.        \\\"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\\\"  says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"But more and more research is showing that particles are  bad actors as well.\\\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate  air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated  pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex  and varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  acid aerosols.        \\\"Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects  of particulate air pollution,\\\" says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"We have no way of  duplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  \\\" Consequently, most of what  is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research  like the Seattle study.        Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur  dioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any  time soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with  asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.      \\\"In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only  cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's  rarely particulate matter,\\\" says Dr.  Schwartz.  \\\"However, PM10 doesn't have  to be near its violation range to be unhealthy.\\\"                                HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993                 NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma  The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on  Diagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in  dermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance  techniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care  professionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological  characteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management,  and followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi  and their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in  preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.  Following 2 days of  presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel  weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement.    Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a  distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins;  (2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential  for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical  excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and  extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4)  patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high  risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely;  (5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for  melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education  and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality  from melanoma.

Within the program, there are four types  of cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily  in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on  clinical research; \\\"comprehensive\\\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a  multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community  outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer  prevention and control research.    Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was  the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new  cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage  of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened  the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and  cancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew  progressively.    In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today,  there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria  for comprehensive status.    To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an  institution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly  established in 1990, the eight criteria for \\\"comprehensiveness\\\" include the  requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in  several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong  program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings  into clinical practice.    Moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly  beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also  referred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting  the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass  strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials,  significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important  outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of  sources.    The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and  capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit  important new findings or address timely research questions.     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 32 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Of the 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers, 14 are of the basic science type.   These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers  engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators  and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications  from new discoveries in the laboratory.    Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and  clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently  incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their  overall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today.    Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely  structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and  control research.  These centers interface with state and local public health  departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention  and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions  responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.   Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with  institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community  hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials.    Together, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward  creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through  interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the  laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

The  decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to  test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of  Health, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and   Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the  therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies  including Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH  that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is  intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the   replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's  reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the  MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.   \\\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the  next 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\\\" said Shalala.    Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine  Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had  convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested  simultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of  multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two  years.  ==================================================================       HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  \\\"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV\\\" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol.  114, No. 14, P. 18        AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was  approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome,  the manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the  drug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that  although HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk  of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit   disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of  the three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the  drug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S.  researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials,  many argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients  experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of   AIDS symptoms.

Those are two separate questions.  Obviously, Israeli authorities do recognize Israeli nationality for some purposes, e.g. passports, consular services, etc...  ID cards have a field of nationality which is a subdivision of the above.  Ostensibly, this field is provided for sevices provided by the religious departments of the gov't, though this is not the general case.   From its onset, Israel's borders have been shaped and reshaped by both war and peace.  As such, the Israeli gov't has always felt that defining its borders is a step that is meaningful only after peace treaties have been conluded with its neighbors.  There is no plan for \\\"ultimate borders\\\" (is this a game like \\\"ultimate frisbee\\\"?) extending into  other countries.   Aside from what Vaanunu provided, no.   If that is true, then by virtue of the question's subject, it is unanswerable.  Anyone who claims its validity. is claiming an oxymoron. That having been said, I deny the above.  You go on to ask quite a number of questions that show an obvious bias.  Questions of the sort \\\"Is it true that you entered your mother's vagina?\\\" which are based upon some kernel of truth, though phrased in a way as to render them repugnant and cast aspersions upon Israel.

Homosexuals lie about the 10% number to hide the disproportionate involvement of homosexuals in child molestation.

Mostly, that means water turning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would  also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives would remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.  As for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince is required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in a dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private ownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe condition. If any random private citizen could not properly keep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation is clearly appropriate.    I disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend themselves and their community. If you look at the American  revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves from, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They didn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for  example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same old regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and destroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate. But their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited for that.  There is also the question of personal and collective arms: The Second Amendment definately protects ownership of personal weapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members to provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers other arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example) a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively) should. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a  disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower. The militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely democratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only 50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would be proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular will were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the members supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the form of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's firepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not of the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite different from the general public (at the very least, they would be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and character of the militia requires that each member provide a roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal weapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.\",\"Bully, Them; Bludgeon Them, Bury Them. --  Dave Feustel N9MYI <feustel@netcom.com>\",\"Sorry, ARF - you dog,  That news was suppressed because the Israeli national volleyball team repeatedly spiked it.

There also should be a connection of the NEUTRAL wire to a ground in the breaker box.  There should be no other  place in the building where such a connection occurs (i.e. not in any of the outlet boxes).   The NEUTRAL (white) wire is a 'grounding conductor' for the plug, and is NOT safe to touch, while the GROUND (green) wire is a 'protective ground' and carries no current unless some kind of electrical fault has occurred.  It's safe to touch the protective ground, but not to touch the  grounding conductor (because there is current in the grounding conductor, its outlet-box end will not be at the same ground potential as its breaker-box end).\",\"Any new reports about iisi clock upgrade to 25 mhz,  33 mhz?

(Sorry all HP fans, but I have a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their (excellent) gear).  One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is whether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock the instrument into real time capture mode.   I agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are _beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus. However, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students) seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or more knobs required of a \\\"real\\\" scope :-)   This is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at least they appear to be logically laid out.  One more thing about the new, \\\"simpler\\\", front panels. These instruments tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the longevity of the instruments.

Thus I've never really believed in God and heaven, although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either - I'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess.         Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how religious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though I want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof - just as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can't definitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by religious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.          Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is correct?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian God exists and the Gods of other religions don't?? How do you feel about people who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me - agnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their beliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isn't there contradiction between the religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do you have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they follow a different religion than you would if they were Christian??          Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in the bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??          I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are fairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and 'Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. The only part I find hard is the actual belief in God.          Finally, what is God's attitude to people like me, who don't quite believe in Him, but are generally fairly 'good' people. Surely not believing doesn't make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering why I so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.

marriage recognized by church and state, that's   prima facie evidence that the commitment isn't really there.  - There are obvious situations in which Christian marriage is possible   without a civil or church wedding: if you're stranded on a desert   island, or if your state forbids the marriage for an unjust reason   (e.g., laws against interracial marriage).  - The legal concept of \\\"common-law marriage\\\" is meant to ensure that   the state will recognize marriages that did not start out with the   usual ceremony and record-keeping.  - Pastorally, I'm concerned that people should not use \\\"being married   in God's eyes\\\" as an excuse for living together without a formal wedding.   One has a duty to have one's marriage properly recorded and witnessed.    - But there are also people who have been through a wedding ceremony   without making a genuine commitment, and therefore are not married   in God's eyes.

I imagine it has something to do with a missing screen driver, or something along those lines, but figured someone out there in Internet land might be able to help.  I am installing it on a machine that already has OpenLook installed, and would like to have both installed concurrently.  Thus, I set it up to compile to my /usr/X11R5 directory.  I worked out all the kinks in getting it compiled (with gcc), so that it compiles without any warnings.  I need it installed for PEX-SI, so I set all those appropriate flags.  When I run it, however, I get a message along the lines of:  Getting interface configuration : Operation not supported on socket  sunOpenFrameBuffer : Inappropriate ioctl for device  Fatal server error : no screens found    Any ideas on how I can fix it?

I not familiar with the ad you are speaking of but knowing Popular Science it is probably on the fringe.  However, you may be speaking of \\\"Public Missle, Inc.\\\", which is a legitimate company that has been around for a while.  Due to advances in composite fuels, engines are now available for model rockets using similar composites to SRB fuel, roughly 3 times more  powerful than black powder motors.  They are even available in a reloadable form, i.e. aluminum casing, end casings, o-rings (!).  The engines range from D all the way to M in common manufacture, N and O I've heard of used at special occasions.  To be a model rocket, however, the rocket can't contain any metal  structural parts, amongst other requirements.  I've never heard of a model rocket doing 50,000.  I have heard of > 20,000 foot flights. These require FAA waivers (of course!).  There are a few large national launches (LDRS, FireBALLS), at which you can see many > K sized engine flights.

Purchase of engines like I have been describing require membership in the National Association of Rocketry, the Tripoli Rocketry Assoc., or you have to be part of an educational institute or company involved in rocketry.  Amatuer rocketry is another area.  I'm not really familiar with this, but it is an area where metal parts are allowed, along with liquid fuels and what not.  I don't know what kind of regulations are involved, but I'm sure they are numerous.\",\"...and in San Francisco recently, some of our finest examples of humanity poured oil over a road so that vehicles going uphill would suddnely become immobile, and then they would walk right up to the vehicles and make their demands known. --------------------------------+--------------------------------------- Mark Barnes, System Engineer    |  <insert standard disclaimers here> SunSoft                         | Corporate Technical Escalations |  I speak for myself, an individual, Menlo Park, CA, USA             |  not for the company for which I work. barnesm@vavau.Corp.Sun.COM      | --------------------------------+---------------------------------------  \",\"NUT CASE PANICS!!!!REALIZES HE'S MADE A COMPLETE FOOL OF HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THOUSANDS OF NETTERS!!!!BACKS AWAY FROM EARLIER RASH STATEMENTS!!!!GOD HAVE MERCY ON HIM!!!! \",\": 8~> I require BGI drivers for Super VGA Displays and Super XVGA Displays.

This is because it's like te PC AT hard disk interface.  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the controller card, then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main memory where it's needed.  If IDE doesn't work this way, then it's not compatible.  Heck, if IDE used DMA, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about ISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDE drives.  16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus, and if IDE did DMA there would be trouble.  (BTW, there are DMA-enabling signals in the IDE cable spec, but the last report I heard was that they are never implemented, because it would require a different kind of IDE adapter and different drivers.)\",\"Excuse the sheer newbieness of this post, but I am looking for a decent PaintProgram which will save to various file formats (.BMP  .PCX  etc etc) via ftp, freeware, or shareware.

JPEG (pronounced \\\"jay-peg\\\") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of \\\"natural\\\", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is \\\"lossy\\\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of \\\"realistic\\\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File    Size in bytes  Comments  ship.ppm 1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits     or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z  963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress     compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.     Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif  240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif     Most of the savings is the result of losing color     info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95  155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)     This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,     at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75   58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)     You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this     from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50   38406  cjpeg -Q 50     This has slight defects; if you know what to look     for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing     the original.  Still as good image quality as many     recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25   25192  cjpeg -Q 25     JPEG's characteristic \\\"blockiness\\\" becomes apparent     at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).     Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were     of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o    6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)     Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or     indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:     the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good \\\"quality\\\" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  \\\"Quality 95\\\" does NOT mean \\\"keep 95% of the information\\\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \\\"op art\\\".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just \\\"high\\\"/\\\"medium\\\"/\\\"low\\\"-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \\\"How to find sources\\\". (If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with \\\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\\\" in the body.  The \\\"Anonymous FTP List FAQ\\\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for \\\"canned\\\" software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  John Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu or ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the version number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on export or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits internally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to convert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first. But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG. CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check the \\\"save at normal size\\\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it's functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) \\\"msdos/graphics\\\" at Simtel20, that really means \\\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\\\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) \\\"/pub/msdos/graphics\\\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip     Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip     PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \\\"AugJPEG\\\", \\\"NewAmyJPEG\\\", \\\"VJPEG\\\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris, but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The \\\"official\\\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article \\\"How to find sources\\\", referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \\\"JFIF\\\" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called \\\"color quantization\\\".  (This is something of a misnomer, \\\"color selection\\\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \\\"smeared\\\" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as \\\"256-color JPEG\\\".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit \\\"hi-color\\\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying \\\"-Q 100\\\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say \\\"-sample 1x1\\\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to \\\"do their own thing\\\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \\\"low-end\\\" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a \\\"high-end\\\" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \\\"lowest common denominator\\\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     \\\"raw JPEG\\\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it's worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is   \\\"begin\\\" line  M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with   \\\"begin\\\" line  M:'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different \\\"back end\\\" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The \\\"fair use\\\" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (\\\"ghost\\\" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \\\"dithered\\\" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to \\\"smooth\\\" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try \\\"-smooth 10\\\" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that \\\"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\\\" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net. \",\"My wife has one of these.

The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi. The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch bore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they intersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter and about 50 cm long.  All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile.    The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing, the projectile vaporizes.  The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is about 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km if fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can fire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB to follow the projectiles.  The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s, and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but I haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).  There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this gun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12= 4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.  This gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful- sized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of 100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg useful payload to orbit.  Dani Eder \",\"I wanted to let people know that this motorcycle has been sold.

Once a criminal has committed a murder, his desires are irrelevant.  And, you still have not answered my question.

Shouldn't we, by your logic, administer as minimum as punishment as possible, to avoid violating the liberty or happiness of an innocent person?\",\" So what you're saying is that your mind is made up, and you'll just explain away any differences at being statistically insignificant?

If they would of had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened.   If they'd gone to the door and knocked on it to serve the  warrant, like the Sheriff had done 3 other times, they  wouldn't have needed to HAVE an initial assault.  But then,  Herr Klinton and Attorney Gen'l Reno wouldn't have been  able to have told such heroic stories about how they  \\\"protected\\\" the rest of us from a group of people who  kept to themselves, miles out in the prairie.  The BATF needs more people, better weapons and more armored transports. When they meet hostile fire they should be able to use more force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going to do a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they must have the proper equipment and people to do the job.   The BATF needs to be disbanded.  This out of control group  of Rambo wannabees is a danger to the Republic.  With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed more now then ever.

(Why? Because it's Monday and I didn't feel like writing any REAL code...)  Anyway, after I wiped out the 60-odd goalies in the list, I came up with:  NHL average:  55 GP      11 G      19 A      30 Pts      69 PIM  Then I passed the list through a second time to come up with the players who had the smallest percentage difference in each of the categories.  Marty McInnis (NYI) 56 GP (1%) 10 G (9%) 20 A (5%) 30 Pts (0%) 24 PIM (65%) Igor Kravchuk (EDM) 55 GP (0%) 10 G (9%) 17 A (10%) 27 Pts (9%) 27 PIM (53%)  These two are close in games, goals, assists, and points, but are too far off in PIM. This leaves, as the most average player in the NHL:  Bobby Carpenter (WAS) 65 GP (18%) 11 G (0%) 17 A (10%) 28 Pts (6%) 63 PIM (8%)  What an honor.  I also passed the list through with the goalies still included. Kravchuk and Carpenter were still in the top three, but Rob DiMaio came flying up from  behind to take the title:  NHL average:  53 GP      10 G      17 A      27 Pts      64 PIM Igor Kravchuk (EDM)     55 GP (3%) 10 G (0%) 17 A (0%) 27 Pts (0%) 27 PIM (50%) Bobby Carpenter (WAS)   65 GP (22%) 11 G (10%) 17 A (0%) 28 Pts (3%) 63 PIM (1%) Rob DiMaio (TB)  54 GP (1%) 9 G (9%) 15 A (11%) 24 Pts (11%) 62 PIM (3%)   It's all really kind of underwhelming when you think about it.  -SG\",\"  Could you expand on this?

Bla-bla.   Indeed, and the current proposal does nothing to prevent the latter.   This doesn't say much. There are many incredibly weak encryption algorithms in commercial use today...   Except from the government.   Nope. The criminals won't be stupid enough to use the new chip, they'll use something secure. This technology provides only means to intercept the phone conversations of people who are stupid enough to use it.   That is, the government has the keys. It doesn't matter much if they are in one or in two of its hands...   Correct. It does, however, provide those Americans with the false sense of privacy.   If the screening is not public, it cannot be trusted. Some people do not trust DES even today, after all the examinations - only because some parts of its design were kept secret.   So they'll use a different technology to hide their illegal activities. So will those law-abiding citizens, who do not trust their government not to misuse its abilities to decrypt their conversations.   Except from the government.   Huh? Later it says that the new technology will be export restricted.   In short, the new technology can:  1) Protect the law abiding citizen's privacy from the casual snooper.  It cannot:  1) Protect him from the government, if it decides to misuse its ability to decrypt the conversations.  2) Protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new encryption scheme or to steal the keys, or to bribe the people who handle them, etc.  3) Prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for communication.    Correct. However, it does not provide them that much privacy as it claims.    Two candidates: the NSA and the Mafia.    That is, \\\"trust us\\\".   \\\"Security through obscurity\\\".   If it's not entirely open to public examination, it cannot be trusted. Besides, who can prove that the devices used for examination and the ones built into your phones will be the same?    The NSA and the FBI?    Why did they \\\"forget\\\" the Academia?    Doesn't this smell to monopolism?    Like the Mafia?   This is the main question, why was it buried at the end?   \\\"We'll see\\\".   \\\"Trust us\\\".   In short, \\\"If we decide to outlaw strong crypto, we'll tell you\\\".   Since the US government seems to consider strong crypto as munitions and since the US constitutions guarantees the right to every American to bear arms, why is not every American entitled, as a matter of right, to an unbreakable commercial encryption product?   Bullshit. The proposed technology provides a false sense of security, encryption devices with built-in capabilities for breaking the encryption, does not prevent the criminals to use strong crypto, and is a step to outlaw strong crypto.    Who was the optimist who believed that the new administration will leave the export controls on strong crypto devices?

A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^         court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.         ^^^^^^^^^^^  The clear implication is that there are \\\"legal\\\" authorizations other than a court order.  Just how leaky are these?  (And who  knows what's in those 7 pages that authorized the NSA?).  There may well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies, in which keys are traded.  Furthermore, the police will be in an excellent position to carry out this kind of thing without being caught.  They already have a communication infrastructure with secure portions.  There are a few laws that I know of, that limit citizens' rights to access police communications (or use the information they get).  It may be very difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have such evidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law.  Throw in private detectives, who have even fewer policy/constitutional restrictions.  Also consider mercenaries who've \\\"retired\\\" from intelligence agencies.  William Gibson must be loving it.  Great story material.  Don't think it'll happen?    Well, consider e.g. the Michigan State Police, generally a very professional organization, which for years kept \\\"Red Files\\\" on thousands of suspected  commies, knowing full well it was not consititutional.  The standards of evidence were just about zero: people were in the file because they happened to park near a place where, say, a US-China People's Friendship rally was happening -- the police went around writing down license plate numbers.  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the  meeting place, well, the state police wound up filing you as a subversive. (They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on any more such nonsense.  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes as well.)  Even with well-meaning cops (and I'm sure there are many), there will  be strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards.  We don't need to assume corrupt or unbalanced officers -- it will all be in the interest  of enforcing sensible laws, saving lives, and protecting property.   Compromises will be made by well-meaning officers, facing what (to them)  will be a moral dilemma.  Clipper will make criminals out of cops.

By such a back- door (in the encryption algorithm perhaps) it would be possible (for   the manufacturer) to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in  one session. This would not, btw, enable anybody else to retrieve the  keys in the same way because they'll never get a bunch of 300 (N,U)  pairs with identical S1 and S2. (Note that these have to be constant  for the whole batch by the very nature of the procedure, i.e., they  have to be typed in manually by the `random number supplying agents'!)  And I was wondering why they'll always do 300 chips in one session ...  Since the procedure described by Ms Denning imposes high costs on the  production of every chip (at least three persons for one hour each,  plus the cost of a laptop finally blown to pieces in a spectacular,  Hollywood-like bonfire; add travelling expenses, drinks and lighting,  divide the sum by 300) there won't be a larger demand -- not from the  private sector anyway.

He was released, because, in the event of an injury to Slaught, LaValliere is no longer capable (they believe) of being the everyday catcher.

All of the vendors I have called say that the internal video will not work on a true VGA monitor but will work on a IBM Compatible multisync like the sony's or the NEC monitors.  I thought the VGA capability of LCIII was very attractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive VGA monitors.  Am I confused or are these vendors just not up to speed?  Has anyone used an LCIII with a non multisync VGA monitor and if so where did you get your adapter (please be specific w/ vendor and cat #)?

Pros arrive late, nervousness for  rookie WC players, and problems to get the lines clicking may make things  hard to get it going against these \\\"worse\\\" nations.  I'd guess that the better team you face in the opening game, the better  it is, since the chances of an upset are greater then.   Some other reasons why the \\\"worse\\\" teams are so tough to beat was presented  by Hans \\\"Virus\\\" Lindberg (former coach in Switzerland).   1) The \\\"worse\\\" teams (referring to France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy etc)     have now usually world class goalies.   2) Their defensive play have become much more disciplined, they take much     less unnecessary penalties.   3) They use four lines which makes it harder to make them \\\"run out of gas.\\\"   4) The ice quality in the German WC rinks is poor.

First Nagarno-Karabagh was Armenians homeland today  Fizuli, Lacin and several villages (in Azerbadjan)  are their homeland. Can't you see the  the  \\\"Great Armenia\\\" dream in this? With facist methods like  killing, raping and bombing villages. The last move was the   blast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees, trying to  escape the from Lacin, a city that was \\\"given\\\" to the Kurds  by the Armenians.      Don't speak about things you don't know: 8 American Cargo planes  were heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities  announced that they were going to search these cargo   planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in Germany.  5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of  of the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not  humanitarian aid.....   Search Turkish planes? You don't know what you are talking about.  Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons  to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan  it self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons  since it's content is announced to be weapons?      \",\" As has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_ and _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is described in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications do indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be accepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and reasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.  But people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy reasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a large part of the history of science.  There are a couple of negative points to make here:  1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct verification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted part of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What would be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical reality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could lie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of experimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.  (I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though. I don't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less a theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it is hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather directly verifying the existence of qi.)  2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational experiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and interpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical controversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall, there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations, petty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which computations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical function of science: results don't count unless they can be replicated.  The whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate part can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.  Pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals; but even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed; that when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate polarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was indistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur's irrational motivation had led to a replicable, and important, result.  This is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not even produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their theories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not concede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress the results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they think supports their position (creationists).\",\"Hi,  we are just completing a project on nebuliser performance, and have a wealth of data on particle size and output which we are going to use to adjudicate a contract next week.  Although the output data is easy for us to present, there seems to be little concensus on the optimum diameter of the nebulised droplets for straightforward inhalation therapy (eg: for asthmatics).  Some say that the droplets must be smaller than 5 microns, whilst others say that if they are too small they will not be effective.  Anyone up on this topic who could summarise the current status ?

Let's say you even trust the escrow houses -- one is the ACLU and the other is the EFF.  (And I'm not entirely joking about those two names)  In that case the Prince of Wales has nothing to worry about on this system.  Indeed, as pointed out, since the current systems, even the current digital systems, are very easy to decode -- right now anybody with an old TV can hear them -- for most people, this will be viewed as an \\\"oh goody\\\" step upwards.  And look at how tolerant the public is.  They're willing to let the neighbours with the radios hear right now.  It was suggested by one person that a *lot* of non-evidentiary wiretapping is going on right now without warrants, because anybody can do it and it's just an ECPA violation.  This would stop that.

No.  Computer speed is only partly dependent of processor/clock speed. Memory system speed play a large role as does video system speed and I/O speed.  As processor clock rates go up, the speed of the memory system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed.  If you have a 50MHz processor, it can be reading another word from memory every 20ns.  Sure, you can put all 20ns memory in your computer, but it will cost 10 times as much as the slower 80ns SIMMs.  And roughly, the 68040 is twice as fast at a given clock speed as is the 68030. \",\"the 'Center for Policy Research' writes...

As I can find no Scripture (have I missed it ?) that details when you are married, I have to make some assumptions based on the PRINCIPLES of Scripture.    It seems to me that it takes 3 parties to make a marriage: husband-to-be, wife-to-be, and God.  If you promise before each other and God that you will convenant together to be married, then...you are (IMO).  So why do we have the ceremonial part ?  That seems to be there for \\\"connectedness\\\" in the Body of Christ.  My brothers and sisters ought to be involved so that there can be some accountability on both our parts.  That's part of the concept from Hebrews about \\\"not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together as is the custom of some.\\\"  We need each other because Lone Ranger Christians and Lone Ranger Marriages smack of a self sufficiency that the I don't see in the NT.  Does anyone see the Paul Simon \\\"I am a rock, I am an island...\\\" model anywhere in Christianity. (Song lyrics show your age :-) ) ?  Further, since marriage is a legal matter/institution in the USA and many other places, and such laws do not specifically go crosswise to the clear teachings of Scripture, we ought to obey them to avoid even the appearance of \\\"evil\\\" (I Thess 5:22)  So this would imply at least a civil ceremony before marriage, but keep in mind we are at least doing all of this for the  conscience of others because back to the beginning...you are married when you and your intended promise each other and God to be in convenant.

(Sorry for length).  To increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed from 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively. This is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some aluminum foil down to work on.  1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case.  2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables,   spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out.  3. Remove the flopy drive.  4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting   the supply straight up and out.  5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom   side of the fan and lifting straight up and out.  6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and   right side of the board and sliding the board forward then   lifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the   board must be removed first)  7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules).   This is not easy even for a skilled solderer.  8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins   by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.  9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder    them in.  10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.  11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and    the other large chip just to the right of the processor and   figure some way to hold the heat sync's in place.

Screw a cross member down over the heat   sync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.   12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.

The all pertain to opportunites for abuse, and conclusions based on what I have seen the membership of this group (except for two notable persons) agree to.  If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it almost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt.  I think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be expanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and stored data. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or such expansion will be almost impossible to stop, using Clipper as a precident). There was a hint of that in the proposal, remember.  That said, please bear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to say what others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.   As I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or similar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions such as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how this thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat this in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other areas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if this proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in several other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not going to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop whenever they want to.  'Court order required' has proven to be a rather flimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the material, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on periodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice system the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty (or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not protected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would result in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions on private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it does make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially fishing expeditions without the target's knowlege.  Don't give up the right to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton and Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing, figuring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come those consulted could be roughly described as \\\"us insiders\\\"?  They cannot quietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its exclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone. Don't buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust, past or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest and the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not 'unlikely' or 'difficult'.   So what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved after the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor, easily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge, would authorize a tap which wouldn't have been possible otherwise.  This has been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For local cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds have a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe for example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen in on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or via a 'master key'?  I sure don't.  This whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use old-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping was rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law Enforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes that require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I just find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much about civil and individual rights, that \\\"puts people first\\\".  The question is \\\"put people first\\\" to WHERE?  With the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN'T exist a 'master key' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword scan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific court order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY. Bet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that they have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to keep them from simply keeping the keys on file for 'next time'? After awhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks they deem 'disruptive'.  And if they get only one key, that would reduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember Nixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn't it?  And unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance! I see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice :-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to a competitor's Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded to be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get one the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important concern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...   What will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption?  You can BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda. It is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...  Expect the argumet \\\"well, if you got nothing to hide...\\\"  Fine. Then using that argument, one should not object to video cameras being installed in every room of one's home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but the principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from a govt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as to 'safeguards'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are pretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.  Don't work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish bad precidents, please.  The price could be hell to pay, later.   People would fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years, because we have this 'crisis' situation which MUST be addressed by some 'drastic action', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother those who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don't buy into it.  If the Clinton Clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public so many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few isolated 'respected experts' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a certain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected experts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was advocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the experts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper Chip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled version (with a 'master key' provision), or features not present in the version subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who chooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there... :-)  And isn't it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT have its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known? I was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything you have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this group are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...  Another question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not be used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure but \\\"good enough\\\" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full description (not a PR non-statement) of just what \\\"good enough\\\" means? I think when saying how strong it is, \\\"good enough\\\" really means \\\"not very\\\".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not acceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and Constitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other countries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as revokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and protections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA have this thing to 'fight crime'.  We have allready have our Bill of Rights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining for yet another 'noble cause', instead we should be trying to repair the damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but \\\"too many rights and safeguards\\\" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court system and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having \\\"too many rights\\\" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime, etc).  BTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe this:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed this thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights under the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades have been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the Constitution.  It has to stop.  Now is as good a time as any, if it isn't too late allready.   \",\"********************[ PC Game For Sale ]******************  Waxworks by Horrorsoft/Accolade (5.25\\\")     $30  By the same folks who brought you Elvira I & II.  I played Elvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally made a very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel is roughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time fighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games, especially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to stay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This  is not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is quite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found that is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting strategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is  no fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain moderately challanging puzzles.  The really interesting thing about this game is that it is really  broken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits you must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transported with no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits traps you inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must  escape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines and pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant zombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue some humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is perhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into Jack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper victim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and  meet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to  stop the almost indestructible zombies.    Over all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a  creepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game. I heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.     *********************************************************  - All prices include shipping. - All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated. - US buyers only please. - All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,   priority USPS. - All games include all original materials including box, manual,   disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.

If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this, then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase, most noticeably in lower rpm range torque. Splitfires didn't do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMC pickup (4.3l V6) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley Sportster 1200 and my best friend's 1986 Sportster 883. Folks I know who've tried them in 1340 Evo motors can't tell any performance boost over plain plugs (which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers are pretty much the same shape, just different sizes). Two of my friends who have shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead, I'd dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense (plus they look really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head)\",\" I'd be willing to make two wagers: 1) Snow doesn't win ROY. 2) Mattingly is out of baseball within five years.

Mattingly is 32 this year, and how many players play until they are 40?  Not too many, and most of them didn't have chronic back problems when they were 32.

For the moment we are only working on MAC and DOS/Windows. The department has    always used sneaker net to transport files to the MAC, since it requires a       filter to strip out the <LF> characters.                                          Until recently no one concidered using any version control to mediate, and as    a result, the 5 programmers spent a great deal of time merging files together    at the end of each week so that a new system could be build. We are now trying   to streamline this process, but are hampered by the lack of software that will   allow us to share files across PC and MAC platforms.

Now, I do not condone myself bombing villages, any kind of villages. But you claim these are villages with civilians, and Iraelis claim they are  camps filled with terrorists. You claim that israelis shell the villages with the 'hope' of finding a terrorist or so. If they kill one, fine, if not, too bad,  civilians die, right ? I am not so sure.   As somebody wrote, Saddam Hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting manner. And he also claimed 'civilians murdered'. Let me ask you, isn't there  at least a slight chance that you (not only, and the question is very general,  no insult) are doing a similar type of propaganda in respect to civilians in southern Lebanon ?  Now, a lot people who post here consider 'Israeli soil' kind of Mediteranean sea. How do you define Israeli soil ? From what you say, if you do not clearly  recognize the state of Israel, you condone killing israelis anywhere.   I do not know what was the pupose of the action you describe. If it was  to kill civilians (I doubt), I certainly DO NOT CONDONE IT. If civilians were  killed, i do not condone it.       Mr. Hernlem, it was YOU, not ME, who was showing a huge satisfaction for 3  israelis (human beings by most standards, Don't know about your standards) killed.  If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a  question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing justifies murder. I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make similar statements, maybe after eliminating all Israelis, jews, ? Am I wrong ?   Now tell me, did you also condone Saddam's scuds on israeli 'soldiers' in, let's say, Tel Aviv ? From what I understand, a lot of palestineans cheered. What does it show? It does not qualify for freedom fighting to me ? But again, I may be  wrong, and the jewish controlled media distorted the information, and I am just an ignorant victim of the media, like most of us. \",\"- Am I justified in being pissed off at this doctor? -  - Last Saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knife. - I took him to a local \\\"Urgent and General Care\\\" clinic at 5:50 pm.

PST                     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING  on the aid package.        SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The  President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed  yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic  and political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.          Before taking your questions and running through the  basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.   First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do  with available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds  have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is  no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund  any of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently  are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin  tomorrow.              The second point is that this package is designed to  support Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package  are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have  been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian  government.              Third, the President is determined that we will  deliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed  to maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we  wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we  feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in  front of you.              Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of  trade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's  capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend  well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of  governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do  so.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make  trade and investment a major priority in the relationship.                They also agreed that there would be a new joint  commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by  Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through  the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote  a vastly expanded relationship.              If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down  the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just  give you some general background on what these programs are.   I'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.              The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food  and medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has  been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian  grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure  there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the  major cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food  for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also  be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and  pharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.              The second item is concessional food sales.  As you  know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship  with Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia  that we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the  Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.   The value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are  concessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out,  but I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on  principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates  thereafter for the life of the deal.              The third program is a collection of private sector  support.  We think this is one of the most important things we're  going to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses  is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.   And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American  enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the  goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in  Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses.                The President has also decided to create a  privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian  government in its priority objective of trying to convert state  enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has  also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a  Eurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by  prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.              The fourth grouping you see there in the summary  page is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that  this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of  pursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total  of $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed  tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're  launching.                The President is also calling for the development of  a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to  try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public  efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in  Russia.              The fifth program you see is Russian office of  resettlement.  This is a new initiative created and  conceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration  project.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military  to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic  states and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to  make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's  with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American  construction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration  basis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working  very closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say  that we have a long-term commitment to this project.                The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They  are two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our  initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the  possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and  gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in  the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much  environmental damage.              I've talked a little bit about trade and investment,  about the new group being created that the Vice President will  chair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing  with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development  committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy,  to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede  trade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time  investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this  problem full-time.                And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and  investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an  analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we  just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a  commitment within our own government to have people work on it --  senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly  important.              You'll notice that the United States is going to  support Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer  status.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested  our advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the  long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is  paramount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are  supporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting  their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.                You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in  credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended  $150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil  project.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an  agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion  framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance  Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services.  We think this is a very important development.  We think we'll  get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo  conference, the G-7 conference.              Before I take any further questions, I'd like to  defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance  objectives with you.              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major  unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts  in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and  secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory  under the terms of the START I and START II agreements.    Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important  agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding  to three important programs.  The first is the program of $130  million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement  program.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for  bomber dismantlement -- $130 million.              The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for  the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed  from the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially  contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the  construction of that storage facility.                And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help  in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear  materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we  add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance  which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall  safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety  measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the  last couple of years.                So this is an area where we will be going a lot more  work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks,  and Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last  couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for  safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian  territory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of  START I, an agreement to accede to NPT.               So we are working very hard with all the parties to  the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with  them.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia  as a very important step in that process.              Q   The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in  Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with  Kazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the  same one, why do you feel it's necessary?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same  deal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil  field.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights  oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced  today.  So it's completely new.              Q   Can you tell us more about what's involved?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like  other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do  two things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west  Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating  oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.   The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the  natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which  will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what  Russia needs.              So we think this deal is very, very good development  for Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an  American company.  And the American government has played a  leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility  in OPIC and through the loan guarantee.              Q   So it's to search and also to renovate fields  that are already there?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.              Q   On that point, should other American companies  expect to get administration support for such deals, or should  they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2  billion?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know,  Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the  U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department  and the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we  think it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th,  there will be $2 billion in financing available for American  companies to sell their equipment and sell their services.              Q   That should take up all of the rest of the  deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be  support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a  tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas  companies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and  gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will  soak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may  even extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.              Q   What's the current year budget costs of that  $2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any  current year budget costs --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer  you to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.              Q   The concessional food sales -- is there any  current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in  which the payments are due?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional  food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.   USDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to  expend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd  refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.              Q   Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?              Q      and the private sector -- how many folks are  going to be involved in that?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start  with the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt  coming into office that there were literally thousands of  organization, private organizations in the United States that in  one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve  democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.   And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that  had a variety of programs in this area.  And so the  administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try  to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give  some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the  efforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.              It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will  soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in  the former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might  use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of  our own government, but the resources of the American private  sector and schools and communities across the nation.              Q      any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word  yet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated  besides the $300 million the President talked about?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration  is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What  the President has done this weekend is to consult really  intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional  measures the United States could take in some of these areas to  support reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he  returns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other  ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.              Q   Two questions about the $700 billion  agricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of  consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.   So why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you  explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans  for food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit  into that situation?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the  United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains  and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think  between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history  here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through  the Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle  to ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of  last year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on  that program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and  therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that  program.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and  other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we  could promote American grain sales.                And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've  announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the  Food for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient  authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked  for a concessional loan program.                I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a  short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but  a long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what  this program is.  It will provide, once the final details are  worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of  principal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the  life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of  interest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we  believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal  for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments  and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this  very important grain relationship, which is important for them,  and it's important for the American farm community.              Q   I gather from what you say that this could make  it explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC  loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through,  is that right?               SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit  about that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing   the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program  because of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you  know about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around  $640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having  taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American  market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to  respond to a specific request from the Russian government for  major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the  grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there,  we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to  great effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with  the Russian government and arrived at this solution.                I think the Russians are pleased because it provides  them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on  the short-term payments.              Q   Where do those funds actually come from?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the  Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's  authority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do  not need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want  to make that general point again:  Everything in this package,  the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been  allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration  can begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very  important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year,  that we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be  able to do so.              Q   How did you arrive at the figure of $700  million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually  have a range from 0 to --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason  for it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us  that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and  harvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the  shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the  harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the  same level of food imports from the West.              Q   I would imagine there's going to be some  considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other  republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.   Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for  the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with  some of the other republics?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very  conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending  American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet  Union.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the  area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that  you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and  roughly 50 percent to the other countries.               In the area of food sales, we have been active with  Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We  will continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this  summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the  other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are  productive and they're hard-hitting.              Q   Has anything happened at the summit to lead  American energy companies and other companies to believe that  Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of  taxing, legalities, bureaucracy?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our  primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not  only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd  like to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're  convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to  support Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of  Western governments have the financial resources over the next  decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private  sector can do that.                We look at our own society and we see tremendous  capability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very  good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial  investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new  technology and new capital to finance new production.                That's what the Russian government has told us it  wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis  on it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on  the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently  last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President  Clinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong  signal to the American business community that we support their  efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex- Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to  support them.              Q   My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to  deliver on making Russia a more --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I  would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr.  Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas  sector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice  President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the  barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil  and gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that  committee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to  the work.              Q   What type of mechanism is already in place to  administer the private sector portion of the program?  And will  the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of  the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the  Russian government for distribution at their will?                   SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking  about the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the  program itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working  through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure  that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to  the intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the  Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can  account for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of  months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of  these programs.              But they are all quite different.  For instance, in  the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it  is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of  the food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working  through Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the  housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers,  we'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the  democratization projects, we're working directly with Russian  private individuals and private foundations.  We're working with  journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have  noticed.              So we literally have here 30 to 40 different  activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be  carried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the  Russian government, some with Russian citizens.              Q   The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and  on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the  President has to do on that?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George  noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in  the relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's  fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we  return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and  we'll get back to the Russian government.              Q   You were not prepared for these questions when  you got here?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared  for these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not  prepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require -- let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require  consultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with  the American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those  concerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before  we take any action.              Q   Is this package designed so that you will not  have to go to Congress for anything at this point?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the  beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all  the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.   So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to  seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In  effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the  agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And  that's the advantage of this particular initiative.              Q   If this, as the President says, is a long-term,  long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment  heading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to  Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are  prepared to go to Congress for various things?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been  clear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with  President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American  funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a  major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by  Representative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that  delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.   And we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where  it stands now.              Q   We've been told repeatedly that a number of  these items represent different or new ways of spending the money  already appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these  items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways  that it was not previously set to be?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've  said that these are all projects that either Congress had  allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were  some funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this  administration took office and had some new ideas about how the  funds might be expended.              We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or  the FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations -- Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to  further our programs.              And example of that is the Food for Progress  concessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of  funding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we  looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American  market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we  found it.              Q   Where, for example, are you getting the money  for this Russian officer resettlement --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the  Freedom Support Act funds.              Q   In other words, all of the money is being  directly spent in new ways, so to speak --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant  projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the  second chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if  you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that  total $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act  funding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year  '92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the  legislative history of those funds.              Q      cooperation --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I  don't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.              Q   Could you tell us please, has anything happened  here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and  Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's  happened here --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents,  President Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this  issue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security  and arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's  session.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly  reinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been  talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple  of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the  discussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very  important negotiation that's been going on essentially between  Moscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially  discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute  to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.                But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend,  I don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.              Q?     Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is  any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current  year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been  earmarked and put it into this fund?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and  mirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We  could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included  out-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to  many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the  privatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already  talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.                We could have put in really big numbers and this  could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:   This package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're  going to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President  feels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy  that the western governments, the combination of governments, put  up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not  able to meet them, we're determined, and the President is  determined, to carry out every single program in this package.   And we'll do it.                But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's  part of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking  for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively  support reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment  on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.              Q      taken it way from any --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.   Okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds;  so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in  Russia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.              Q   In terms of funding, there is no available  monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money  somewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I  don't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the  example is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit  guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay  back within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt  problem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we  looked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement  for grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and  also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers  have a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply  look for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative  authority to do it.  This program has been successful in other  areas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union,  but we thought we should now.                 Q   Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package  for Russia, since these funds were really first derived by  initiatives put forward by President Bush?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think  that's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were  appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This  administration took office and inherited some obligations that  the Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven  week review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments  that had been made by the previous administration.                But we have gone well beyond them in funding the  enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not  been filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to  it.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them  into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say,  is another Clinton initiative.                Further, we listened to the Russian government and  listened to the Russian military who told us that the  resettlement of their officers was important to them for  political and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton  has responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment  that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out  a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.                I would also say that the President has given  impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly  about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we  have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends  itself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the  creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative,  we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private  sector as well as the American government, to achieve that  objective.                So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And  as most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the  last administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last  administration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton  assistance package for Russia.              Q   There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the  past has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this  outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money  will not just disappear because it's being administered by the  Russian government?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I  know that the President and other senior officials of our  government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and  that it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's  intended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the  State Department will take great care in making sure that the  funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their  source.              I would not that this package is not simply a  package of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of  these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are  going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals,  with businesses.  The private enterprise support is another  example of that.              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add  a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one  area that we've been looking at very, very closely is  consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting  for these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely,  of course, with the American firms, who would be the prime  contractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of  a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that  funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in  Russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent  efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.              Q   When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly  when do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President  is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think  it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over  the next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties  on May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over  the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach  out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us  to help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said  that we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate  in a much more effective way the activities of our own  government.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in  Russia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw  them together and to focus their efforts.              Q   Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will  actually be spent in the United States by American made goods?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any  figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something  up in the next couple of days on that.              Q   This figure is larger than the figure that has  been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result  of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think -- unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and  I'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put  us to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was  briefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the  intellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of  the ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we  had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have  been refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week  going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in  Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.   And so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been  together for about two weeks.              Q   Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There  was so much talk before about the President wanted to get  Yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.   Is that in the out years?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.   President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance,  that support for the creation of private businesses is important  to him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is  important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize  the state industries is important to them.                And so what we did was to try to make those the  centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We  listened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been  working with the Russian government for months on this trying to  work out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of  these programs was involved every step of the way.                But let me get at the other part of your question.   The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader  set of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking  for his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the  table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in  housing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to  consult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other  allied governments that are also active.              Q   There's essentially nothing that happened in  the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that  you came in with?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular  package, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks  ago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on  the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've  primarily talked about future, about what more the United States  and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia,  which is our base objective here.              Q   I noticed that you -- that money appropriated  to train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me  what about job training for workers who are displaced by  privatization?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we  have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and  financial services in the United States.  Part of the housing  initiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain  Russian officers who are retiring into other professions.              Q      money for job training for workers whose  jobs are disappearing because of privatization --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet  allocated any money for that.              Q   Why not?              Q      of the $6 million is going to build 450  housing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the  Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do  housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework  of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've  got to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think  about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also  retraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming  out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.   We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers  as well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian  government.              Q      of the $6 million will go to retrain --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.              Q   Are you talking about apartment buildings or  single --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about  single, individual dwellings.              Q   You're saying that only 450 families will be  served by this?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I  thought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.   What we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the  Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building  housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with  a huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next  couple of months and try to figure out with American  organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job  done.                I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.   And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into  this in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to  spend the money wisely.              Q   What is it about this program that convinces  you that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be  in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back,  especially considering their other debt problem?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think  it's important to note that the United States on its own does not  have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.   It's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to  our allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what  the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We  can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do  so, which is consistent with our national interests.              Q   Did the President say that the value of the  U.S. contribution was that it would create security and  prosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this  program that does this?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to  go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia,  and that is we want to do everything we can to support the  continuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay  in power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear  forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction,  which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in  Russia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that  this program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we  have to make a long-term commitment to it.              Q   And then on the question of Russia's ability to  repay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15  years from now?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian  government has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping  is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve  their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency  revenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years  from now to pay back those loans.              Q      substantial government-to-government loan  we've ever gotten into with the Russians?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to  answer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years  on this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because  the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to  just ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of  effort.              Q      government loans in any other sector that  you recall?

I have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to  main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy rate, and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than off-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the F.B. followed by a write)  If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmaps in CPU main memory, the rates you can get through MIT-SHM are likely to be equal (maybe a tad slower, depending on your OS's implementation of shared memory) to CopyArea from pixmap to window, which is also then just a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device.  One advanage of MIT-SHM is that if your images are large, you don't end up growing the size of the server process to hold them.  One disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that, in its sample implementation, there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments if the client dies a sudden, violent death (e.g., \\\"kill\\\").  You have to  be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments.   Ken\",\" The current mining regulations and fees were set in the 1800's!

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS      Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints     have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on     microfilm.      The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it     is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like     guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB     have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch     from.      By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify     the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean     sheet design.       WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE      Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access     for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an     opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being     \\\"scooped\\\" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently     releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early     in a mission.       RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES      There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to     block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium     thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in     worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental     reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.     Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2     RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather     satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months     with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar     module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which     was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in     the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10     half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].

IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER      From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from     the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible     for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted     study, Charles Jackman.      The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was     organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space     Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia     (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space     Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and     Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects     of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.      The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:         Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year    Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year    Shuttle sources:   725,000 kilograms/year      The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are     launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the     total stratospheric chlorine sources.      The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would     be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.      The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and     Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch     schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons     do at the present time.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE      If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a     minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your     breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to     watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your     Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal     experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no     immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do     not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.      Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \\\"the bends\\\", certainly some     [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from     lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,     you're dying. The limits are not really known.

HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED      The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is     a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.     What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank     came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the     astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin     team's medical/forensic report.      The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the     water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks     underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team     examined them, they were sent off to be buried.       USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT      You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit     because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry     enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.      Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of     that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in     the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly     specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it     higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit     spacecraft.      [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]       THE \\\"FACE ON MARS\\\"      There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid     face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:     35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often     published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13     (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).      Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is     artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an     extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the     resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a     smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere     on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't     know the address) to study the Face.      The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution     camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this     question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is     best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or     sci.astro.      V. DiPeitro and G.

XtUnrealizeWidget(top);         XtDestroyWidget(top);         XtDestroyApplicationContext(app);         XCloseDisplay(dis); // ??? }  main() {         for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)                 bla(); }  Note that I rewrote XtAppMainLoop so that at a given time (in this example, after 10 XEvents) the function will exit and return to the main program. With this example, I get the following error on about (this is NOT consistent) the 5th call to bla():  X Error of failed request:  BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter)   Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC)   Resource id in failed request:  0xe0000d   Serial number of failed request:  71   Current serial number in output stream:  86  If I take out the XtUnrealizeWidget(top); line, it just dumps core on the seconds call.  Furthermore, every time I call XtAppInitialize() (other than the 1st time), I get:  Warning: Initializing Resource Lists twice Warning: Initializing Translation manager twice.   So finally, my question is this:  What needs to be done in order to be able to call a function which creates an XtAppContext and widgets multiple times?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  PLEASE respond via email as I dont usually have time to read this group.  Thanks very much.  -davewood --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David Rex Wood -- davewood@cs.colorado.edu -- University of Colorado at Boulder\",\"Nutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter than sugar.  Some people are concerned about the chemicals that the  body produces  when it degrades nutrasweet.  It is thought to form formaldehyde and known to for methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate  substances.  The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde produced are high enough to cause significant damage, as both are toxic to living cells.  All I can say is that I will not consume it.    Phenylalanine is nothing for you to worry about.  It is an amino acid, and everyone uses small quantities of it for protein synthesis in the body.  Some people have a disease known as phenylketoneurea, and they are missing the enzyme necessary to  degrade this compound and eliminate it from the body.  For them, it will  accumulate in the body, and in high levels this is toxic to growing nerve cells.  Therefore, it is Only a major problem in young children (until around age 10 or so) or women who are pregnant and have this disorder.  It used to be a leading cause of brain damage in infants, but now it can be easily  detected at birth, and then one must simply avoid comsumption of phenylalanine as a child, or when pregnant.  \",\" I just put replaced the motherboard in a system and had similar questions. My 2 cents worth:  The speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker.  A speaker being a coil, it's bidirectional and makes no difference which way you attach.  Turbo switch.   There are three wires to control how you want turbo to become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I think the middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in, and which two wires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriate two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard.  LED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending which way the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard, if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the board, the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboard is like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn't light, power off, reverse the connectors and try again.   It should work.  If it does, then attach the turbo switch to the board.  Hope this helps.\",\"   Not any more the rules don't say that.

EDT                  Q   Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed?                  MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we  put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national  police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to  10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At  11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on  his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At  12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval  Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations. Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the  various groups.              Q   A photo op with Vessey?              MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.              Q   Why?              MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.                Q   What about the lunch?              MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.              Q   Is he meeting with any congress people today?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.              Q   There are no meetings --              MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today,  no.              Q   Has the President been given any information by the  Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report  from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the  Vietnamese on that subject?              MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order  of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll  discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the  parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't  drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's  something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese  about first.              Q   Did the President talk with any Republican senators  yesterday about the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.              Q   How many times?              MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last  night.              Q   What was the outcome of that?              MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind  of an agreement on a jobs package.              Q   Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any  way flexible on this?              MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going  to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll  continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some  kind of an agreement.              Q   Did they discuss the VAT tax?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.              Q   Can you check that?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.        Q   So what are they -- is the President offering to  scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down  to where Dole will sign on?              MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it  as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs  package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as  we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the  moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress  including, obviously, Senator Dole.              Q   Is he talking to anybody else?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other  Republicans yesterday.              Q   Is he talking to anybody today?              MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I  wouldn't rule it out.              Q   We were led to believe that the President called  Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the  conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?              MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several  people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the  stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation  he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the  conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business,  but it was both.              Q   In the President's mind, are they linked  politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the  stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to  the American people?  Has he made that argument?              MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what  arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed  to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people  first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional  Russian aid last night in Tokyo.              Q   But does the President believe that the stimulus  package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for  Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?              MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to  continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs  package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs  package through the Congress.              Q   Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating  now with Dole?              MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.              Q   On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over  the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they  had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the  Senate for the jobs package.              Q   But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other  than Shelby?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a  vote.              Q   What about Kohl?              Q   Kohl and Feingold?              MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll  continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to  bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of  the members of the United States Senate support the package.              Q   If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold,  why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?              MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of  projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose  funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.              Q   No Democrats.  (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.              Q   Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any  other Republicans again today?              MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but  again, I wouldn't rule it out.              Q   Does he plan to put out any more press releases to  any other states today?              MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of  breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I  think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those  up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest  how their states would benefit from this package.              Q   Will you share those with us?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.              Q   Do you have copies of the ones you sent --              MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And  we certainly can continue to provide them today.              Q   Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent  stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has  been given?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think  the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was  something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he  has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add  to that.              Q   But he also said that business and labor groups are  telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --              MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going  to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that  there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't  think he said he was directly contacted by them.              Q   Are we to take that to mean that the administration  has sounded out business and labor groups on this --              MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public  discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think  I want to add to that.              Q   In February, though, the President said that this  was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What  has happened between then and now to cause this administration to  change its mind?              MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is  something that the working groups are looking at.  They're  considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to  specific options that will be covered by the President's health care  plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision  on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.              Q   You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being  considered by anyone in the White House after the President's  comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.              Q   And then suddenly --              Q   What happened?        MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said  throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options  across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about  and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added  tax.        Q   But the President himself took this off the table,  Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility  of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?        MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it  hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are  looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and  no decisions have been made.        Q   And it raises the question of how independently the  task force is working.        MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider  all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're  considering all options.        Q   But that's not the impression that the President  left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something  that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The  clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was  not on the table, not an option.         Q   \\\"If it changes I'll tell you.\\\"              Q   Bring him on.        Q   And you repeatedly referred to the President's  remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.              MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)              Q   But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna  Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an  orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers  --        MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a  Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not  orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last  couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We  confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.        Q   Is it because he has very few options?        Q   Is this something that it will be incumbent upon  the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has  the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the  task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in  fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with  the President?          MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at  this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their  mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and  the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I  think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that  context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been  made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a  decision on.        Q   They will present it to him as one of his options,  though he specifically ruled it out?        MS. MYERS:  Correct.        Q   Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is  this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to  this form of taxation?        MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The  working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number  of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that  they're looking at is the VAT.         Q   Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining  this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period  that you were telling us that it was not?        MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of  their drafting of options is.  I don't know.        Q   Who was telling you that it was not under  consideration?        MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's  comments.        Q   Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise  enough money to fund the core benefit package?        MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made  on how to pay for the health care plan.              Q   I'm asking whether the projections --              MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how  the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going  to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so  you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out  until you know.        Q   Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer  models on a number of possible packages.        MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q   The question is whether they have now determined  whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest  minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.        MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're  not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being  considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact  details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for  them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.                Q   And when the President has been meeting with health  care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing  --              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q      they have never once said to him, these are your  funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT  in his --              MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific  nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular  briefings.              Q   Well, you have.              MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not  considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.              Q   No, but you said that it has not been presented to  him as an option.              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of  what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.              Q      specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't  looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of  paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?   Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it  works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --              MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if  you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical  discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were  generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly,  it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean,  that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process  of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.   It's something that the working groups will present to him among the  number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not  going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where  health care issues are being discussed.              Q   It's your statement from this podium that no  discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that  the option has not been presented to him.              MS. MYERS:  That is correct.              Q   Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand  by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?              MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have  nothing to add to what's already been said.              Q   Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin  said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or  considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made  so that it would be less regressive?              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what  might happen if.              Q   But do you stand by the previous conversations in  February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said  you'd exclude food and energy --              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific  structure of a decision that hasn't been made.              Q   Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's  comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working  groups?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --              Q   Could you check for us, because that's a real  important credibility question?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.              Q   Since the task force was brought together this  issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one  fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in  the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month  and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be  considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?              MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.   It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has  not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to  add.              Q   Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of  questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem  with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if  you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered  while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if  it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading  us.              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come  out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.              Q   Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to  indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --              MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or  deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about  this issue.              Q   All we were trying to find out --              MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out  and I've given you the answers, Helen.              Q   We're trying to find out what changed -- what made  it an option again.  That's the --              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.                Q   Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you  investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?              MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously  considering and the President has not made a decision on.              Q   Yes, but he took it off the table in February.              MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll  present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.              Q   Why would they consider it if he has taken it off  the table?              MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table.               Q   Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change  his mind?              MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.              Q   Did he change his mind?              MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a  decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's  something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on  this we'll let you know.              Q   So he must have changed his mind, right?              MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean,  --              Q   Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he  changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority  exceeds the President's.              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to look at all options; they've done that.              Q   Are you going to put out his income tax?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on  his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be  available.               Q   Will there be any kind of briefing to go through  it?              MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will  be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you  through the questions.              Q   We're used to be walked line-by-line through the  presidential tax forms.              MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)              Q   Could we have one?              MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of  a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer  your questions about it.              Q   Did they file a joint form?              MS. MYERS:  Yes.              Q   When did he file it?              MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.              Q   Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for  Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the  meeting.              Q   No backgrounder today?              MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.              Q   This is complicated stuff.  We need help.   (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in  one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)              Q   Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of  force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it  out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your  thinking on whether or not to change your approach?              MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards  Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --              Q   But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they  people whose opinions would carry weight with you?              MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight  certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've  initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia,  although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the  Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on  to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options,  which we've been saying regularly.              Q   One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a  straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not  set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or  tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?              MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them  every day.              Q   Which doesn't work so --              MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.   We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we  support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on  the 26th.                Q   You say it's having an effect -- can you give us  any documentation?              MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to  you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.              Q   There's been no -- you have not been able to  provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any  effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.              MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia  and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be  happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if  you'd like.              Q   We would like to hear from someone who can show us  what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of  the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't  seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you  provide something along those lines?              MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.              Q   On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced  this morning -- where is that money coming from?              MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the  details of that package.              Q   So that would be new money that you would hope to  get?              MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the  $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have  seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in  Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.              Q   Isn't there a concern, though, about offering  something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the  concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.              MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do  something immediately, which required money that was already approved  in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit  longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we  announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional  approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to  work with Congress to make that happen.              Q   To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of  conversations with members and will continue to work with them as  this process moves forward.              Q   Was Christopher able to put this package out with a  fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with  Congress.              Q   In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is  that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and  the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs  package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help  give kids something to do.              Q   Who are they?              MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three  organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police  Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police  Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union  of Police Associations.              Q   Will the FBI chief be there?              MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.              Q   Or any other federal law enforcement officials?              MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these  national law enforcement organization leaders.              Q   Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the  $400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?              MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.              Q   So this would be the $700 million that's in the  budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?              MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700  million already in the budget.              Q   Is this going to be part of the supplemental or  Fiscal '94 --              MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact  funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.              Q   This $1.8 billion on top of --              MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400  million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.              Q   And this is what prompted the President to call Bob  Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was  calling Bob Dole?              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting  with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.              Q   Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some  Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are  complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House  and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the  other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these  Chambers of Commerce?              MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)   After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any  attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of  being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled  by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local  Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on  this and other initiatives.              Q   What's the status of the President thinking about  going to this Democratic retreat?              MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost  certainly go.              Q   All three days?              MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be  there yet.                Q   Is it open to coverage?              MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.              Q   Is he going to have any kind of address, statement,  anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?              MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't  made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or  what --              Q   Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it  out.              Q   What about an AIDS czar?              MS. MYERS:  It's coming.              Q   Anything on the weekend?              Q   There's been a suggestion that he's going to this  retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear  or have any involvement in the gay rights march.              MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been  discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic  retreat.              Q   The weekend?              MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on  right now is the radio address on Saturday.              Q   Any travel plans?              MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.              Q   He's not going to be off campaigning for his  stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.              Q   What about mid-week?  Anything likely?              MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely  that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.              Q   Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.              Q   Going to name a drug czar this weekend?              MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.              Q   And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going  to be focused on the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.

And Windows 3.1 is also flexible enough at install time that you can copy all the files onto your hard disk, which greatly speeds things up and makes them less annoying, if you can spare the 7 or so compressed megs.   No, we're not.  But we're also not going to promote pandering to corporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience.  I don't *like* dealing with floppies.  Personally, I have no use for changing the registration info, but I see it as a valid need, and one that ought to be solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hour reinstall that's just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one way or another.  So, while I'm not going to put much time into it myself, here's the procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information:  1.  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want to install it.  I've been using c:\\\\WINSTALL myself.  2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\\\\WINORIG.  3.  Install from c:\\\\winstall.  4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.       i.e., comp *.* \\\\winorig\\\\*.* >\\\\report.txt  5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming they didn't cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one file should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate said offset in the original directory and see what's there using a hex editor, and do the same for the modified one.  6.  You're on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don't really do cryptography.  It's probably just an xor key or something; I think MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing his copy than with \\\"real pirates\\\" who will probably just disassemble the damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original floppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able to back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a compare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).  As I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and don't do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one directory to another may be less arduous.

I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another transient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred  times.  The 2020 has about 1-3 mVp-p of common mode noise and this tends to make my measurements hard to repeat.  (The noise is not quite in sync with  line frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64Hz).  How can I get rid of the noise?  When I look at the spectrum using an HP 3582A (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute I switch to  'isolation' on the input.

I just thought of another one, in the Bible, so it's definately not because of *lack* of religion.  The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for other reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy and peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions  lying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice, peaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to mind...  I agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally intended for.  That doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in the Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own stomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to kill by their leaders.  The point is that there are many things involved in religion that often lead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant side effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching between Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.    @Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest parts of Man's history.@  Atheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological social caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs. The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to further their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these were groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more powerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples because there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over religion that he does not have many choices.  Well, I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom of little silver butter-dishes.  -ciao\",\"Correction:    |The story I related is one of the seven apparitions   |approved by our Church as worthy of belief.

These things sacred to Himself.  He may place any  pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.  Moreover, there are precedents in scripture where knowledge of sacred things is withheld:  1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructed Peter, James, and John to \\\"tell the vision to no  man, until the Son of man be risen again from  the dead\\\" (Matt. 17:9).   If we were living at the time of Savior, there would be no (public) record of this event.  2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision  of \\\"paradise\\\" when he \\\"heard unspeakable words,  which it is not lawful for a man to utter\\\" (2 Cor. 12:4). This person heard something which Paul can not  write to the Corinthians (and us).  3. There is an incident recorded in the Book of Mormon where words uttered by \\\"babes\\\" were  \\\"forbidden that there should not any man write them (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text follows for those of you without access to the BOM).  3 Nephi 26:16 Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the  multitude gathered themselves together, and they both saw and heard these children; yea, even  babes did open their mouths and utter marvelous things; and the things which they did utter were forbidden that there should not any man write them.  Some LDS scholars speculate that these words which could not be written are the sacred portions from temple we are to withhold from  the world (but it could be something else).   There is much we can discuss about the temple  ordinances.  We can discuss regarding baptisms and other vicarious ordinances for the dead. We can discuss certain concepts regarding the endowment (\\\"the ritual\\\"). However, there are certain elements I can not discuss with anyone (including other saints) outside of the temple. As a portion of the endowment, we receive the tokens and signs that will permit us access to Heaven.  I must keep this knowledge sacred  and respect the conditions under which it is revealed to me.\",\" (Neil Williams) writes...  #  #As long as we're on the subject...

We hear, practically daily, that the NSA monitors, oh, everything. They can crack anything. They'd never release a cryptosystem they couldn't crack.   Where do people get these fascinating facts?

I'm pretty sure the NSA is supposed to, among many other things, provide high-quality cryptosystems to a variety of places. I don't recall reading anywhere reliable that they're supposed to:   1) Monitor my phonecalls.  2) Monitor usenet.  3) Provide only cryptosystems they can easily crack.  4) etc etc.   This is not to say that they *don't*, they might. But you don't know that they do, and you have no evidence that they do, for almost all values of you.

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the newsgroups.  Many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles:     1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers    2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism    3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)    4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument    5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources  This is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The others are entirely optional.

The articles titled \\\"A Primer on How to Work With the Usenet Community\\\", \\\"Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet\\\" and \\\"Hints on writing style for Usenet\\\" are particularly relevant.

These articles are free.  Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute them to anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to the author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network.                                   Finding Stuff  All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are some suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:  1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with    \\\"Alt.Atheism FAQ:\\\".  2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.     If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up    correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the    problem.  3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].    Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest    versions of the FAQ files there.     FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you    need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with        send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq     in the body.  4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article    \\\"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\\\" carries a list of these    sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.  5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu    consisting of the following lines:        send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources       send usenet/alt.atheism/faq       send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction       send usenet/alt.atheism/logic       send usenet/alt.atheism/resources  5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of    the following lines:        send atheism/faq/faq.txt       send atheism/faq/logic.txt       send atheism/faq/intro.txt       send atheism/faq/resource.txt     and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.    There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are \\\"help\\\" and    \\\"send atheism/index\\\".  6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the    newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this    if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to    clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.    it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,    people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have     FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files. \",\"Walter-  I tried several times in the past to communicate with you and Susan, but you ignored me, and I don't honestly believe my letters were mean.

The psoriasis is under control but the arthritis part of the illness is not.  Ansaid (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) worked pretty well for three years but isn't helping much now.  My friend is now taking Meclomen (another NSAID) but this isn't helping control the pain at all.  In the past two months my friend has also started taking Azulfadine along with the NSAID medicines, but the effects of the combined drugs aren't supposed to be realized for several months.  As a result of the pain, my friend is having problems sleeping.  Staying in one position too long is an ordeal.  Another major contributor to pain is that tendonitis has now developed (left thumb and hand with numbness at the base of the palm; bottom of feet; shoulders and outer thighs).  The tendonitis is quite painful yet my friend's doctor has not recommended any form of treatment to relieve it.  The latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and is now recommending Prednisone.  The hope is that the Prednisone will relieve some of the pain from the tendonitis.  My friend is a 41 year old male who feels like he's 80 (his words, not mine).

Skirts generally have better pockets now, too.  Dresses, espcially fancy dresses, are still pretty hopeless.

Unfortunately, the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined with other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case: \\\"Ctrl Any<Key>q\\\".   This is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If you're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's expectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as translations.   If you mean \\\"menu accelerator\\\", no it's not possible.  That's according to the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.   I can't think of a reason why not.   There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).  For example,    applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade        -- filePulldown - openPushbutton          - exitPushbutton    *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O   *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O   *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q   *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q    *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\\\\n\\\\     Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\\\\n\\\\     Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)  You have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.  I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I used TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators on the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I described above should work.\",\"I am looking for some bar code fonts especially code 3 of 9.

CRYPTO '93  -  General Information  (August 22 - 26, 1993) ............................................................................  THE PROGRAM:  Crypto'93 is the thirteenth in a series of workshops on  cryptology held at Santa Barbara, and is sponsored by the International  Association for Cryptologic Research, in cooperation with the IEEE  Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, the Computer  Science Department of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and  Bell-Northern Research (a subsidiary of Northern Telecom). The program  for the workshop will cover all aspects of cryptology. Extended abstracts of  the papers presented at the conference will be distributed to all attendees  at the conference, and formal proceedings will be published at a later date.  In addition to the regular program of papers selected or invited by the  program committee, there will be a rump session on Tuesday evening for  informal presentations. Facilities will also be provided for attendees to  demonstrate hardware, software and other items of cryptographic interest.  If you wish to demonstrate such items, you are urged to contact the General  Chair so that your needs will be attended to. The social program will include  hosted cocktail parties on Sunday and Monday. In addition, there will be a  beach barbecue on Wednesday evening. The price of the barbecue is included  in the room and board charge, and extra tickets may be purchased.  ABOUT THE CONFERENCE FACILITIES:  The workshop will be held on the campus of  the University of California, Santa Barbara. The campus is located adjacent  to the Santa Barbara airport and the Pacific Ocean. Accommodations are  available in the university dormitories at relatively low cost for conference  participants. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to stay in the  dormitories, so those bringing small children will need to make separate  arrangements in one of several nearby hotels. More information on hotels is  enclosed. Parking on campus is available at no cost to the participants.  However, participants must indicate on the registration form if they desire  a parking permit.  TRAVEL INFORMATION:  The campus is located approximately 2 miles from the  Santa Barbara airport, which is served by several airlines, including  American, America West, Delta, United, and US Air. Free shuttle bus service  will be provided between the Santa Barbara airport and the campus on Sunday  and Thursday afternoons. All major rental car agencies are also represented  in Santa Barbara, and AMTRAK has rail connections to San Francisco from the  north and Los Angeles from the south. Santa Barbara is approximately 100 miles  north of Los Angeles airport, and 350 miles south of San Francisco.  REGISTRATION:  Participation is invited by interested parties, but attendance  at the workshop is limited, and pre-registration is strongly advised. Late  registrations, subject to a late registration fee, may be accepted if space  is available, but there are NO GUARANTEES.

CRYPTO '93  -  Hotel Information ............................................................................  For those who choose not to stay in the dormitories, the following is a  partial list of hotels in the area. Those who choose to stay off campus are  responsible for making their own reservations, and early reservations are  advised since August is a popular season in Santa Barbara.

I have no problem with Christians burning their own pieces of art (though I find it a tragic waste). I do however have a  problem with their attempts to censor what I may or may not view.  P.\",\"I'm looking for some Game Boy games.  Please e-mail me with your list and offers!  Thanks!  Also, if you have a game boy you want to get rid of, please tell me.  \",\"What's the feeling about eating and riding?  I went out riding this weekend, and got a little carried away with some pecan pie.  The whole ride back I felt sluggish.  I was certainly much more alert on the ride in.  I'm sure others have the same feeling, but the strangest thing is that eating is usually the turnaround point of weekend rides.  From now on, a little snack will do.  I'd much rather have a get that full/sluggish feeling closer to home.  -Paul\",\"Tampa Bay                        1 1 0--2 Philadelphia                     3 2 1--6 First period      1, Philadelphia, Carkner 3 (unassisted) 1:24.      2, Philadelphia, Hawgood 9 (Recchi, Lindros) pp, 5:56.      3, Philadelphia, Lindros 37 (Recchi, Hawgood) pp, 9:52.      4, Tampa Bay, Beers 12 (Zamuner, Chambers) pp, 15:06.

PHILIP K. DICK  Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short  stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable. He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:  \\\"Galactic Pot-Healer\\\" A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.  \\\"A Maze of Death\\\" Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.  \\\"VALIS\\\" The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.  \\\"The Divine Invasion\\\" God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.  MARGARET ATWOOD  \\\"The Handmaid's Tale\\\" A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it \\\"right\\\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked, and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \\\"old world\\\" are hunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.  VARIOUS AUTHORS  \\\"The Bible\\\" This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it is probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is about.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one true version.

RICHARD SWINBURNE  \\\"The Existence of God (Revised Edition)\\\", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with \\\"The Coherence of Theism\\\" (1977) and was concluded with \\\"Faith and Reason\\\" (1981).  In this work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were decisively rejected in Mackie's \\\"The Miracle of Theism\\\".  In the revised edition of \\\"The Existence of God\\\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.  J. L. MACKIE  \\\"The Miracle of Theism\\\", Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational, such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \\\"replacements for God\\\" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.  JAMES A.

All of these have DIFFERENT SPEEDS and COSTS. Lumping them all together as 'SCSI' is dumb and sloppy.

So here are the Specs on everybody AGAIN {With some added info}:  SCSI-1 {SCSI-1 controler chip} asynchronous range: 0-3MB/s  synchronous range: 0-5MB/s  Both common to the PC world; difference is  mainly in software not hardware.  SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 controller chip; also called SCSI-2 (8-bit)}: 4-6MB/s with  10MB/s burst.  This is advertised as SCSI-2 in BYTE 4/93:159 FOR the  PC and AT THESE SPEEDS.{NOT the Mac, the PC.}  {I have not seen the following for EITHER the Mac or the PC} SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:  asynchronous range: 0-5MB/s {infered from BYTE 4/93:159}  synchronous range: 0-8.3MB/s.  Note that I ALSO give the AVERAGE through put for SCSI-2 which holds true a Mac OR IBM/PC clone with the correct hardware and software. And since PC ADVERSIZEMENTS are using Theoretical performance figures WHY  CANNOT WE?   With PC articles like the following it is obvious that the problem is NOT with SCSI but with the PEOPLE WHO REPORT IT! {Like YOU.} Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote:  (My comments in {}) \\\"Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI,{This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE...\\\" {this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with  a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2} PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 The ARTICLE is confused, NOT SCSI.  The TERM is a mess from inconsitant use NOT because the interface itself is a mess.  SCSI means \\\"The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2\\\" NOT 'SCSI-1' as some people want to use it.  To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read: {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} \\\"Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the  speed of IDE...\\\" or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2} \\\"Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as ESDI, 20% faster than IDE...\\\"  NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.\",\" At issue was not a trial behind closed doors, but arrest, trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy.  This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason to believe it still goes on.  Read this:  From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992  PUBLICATION BAN          The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many         years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were         sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of         their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever         being made public.  By Baruch Me'iri  All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way or another: \\\"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published\\\".  The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest, and later on their imprisonment.  In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of this country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison, for security offenses, in complete secrecy.  In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA] affair -- we heard about \\\"the third man\\\" being in prison.  But many years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former Communist countries.  But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.  The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:  \\\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner\\\", asserts MK Zucker.  On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \\\"There is absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public.  \\\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\\\"  Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question.  \\\"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret\\\", wrote Zucker.  The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that, \\\"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter\\\".  \\\"The Union is aware\\\", says Shiffman, \\\"of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.  \\\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy...\\\"  Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible.  \\\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it.\\\"  -- Do you find this situation acceptable?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand, though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least are aware of his imprisonment.\\\"  -- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the discretion of the court?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which they can misuse.\\\"  -- And what if there really is a security issue?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.  Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public.\\\"  Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  \\\"A healthy situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security\\\".  A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir.  \\\"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.  \\\"Nevertheless\\\", adds Shtendal, \\\"the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned. The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\\\"  Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \\\"As a rule, clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances.\\\"\",\" Or, if you've got some entreprenuerial (sp?) spirit, get a cheapy clear plastic box, mount the simm inside, and sell it as a 'Pet SIMM'!

Whether it is photos or just data or whatever.  Here is a simplified way of looking at it: The first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks.  The second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still exists, because you cannot change, only add.  So if you put that in a 'normal' drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all data.

My opinion, FWIW, to all:  Mark, age doesn't matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays better than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las Vegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major league hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have the league data from the mid-80s to check it out.  That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to start the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league season in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very poorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill are not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers, they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around .220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on the Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at any level, at any age, doesn't satisfy MY standards of evidence.

Granted, I thought his behavior with McCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first time he ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But he has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is more valuable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24), had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor, EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF (which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15 best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching his \\\"prime\\\" season of 27. He should be considered as a legitimate prospect, and not as a simple side-show attraction.

I was raised in a religious atmosphere, and attended 13 years of religious educational institutions..  I know the bible well. So well I can recognize many passages from memory.    <<****Strong opinions start here...****>>  1) The human being is an _animal_ who has, due to his/her advanced mental facilities, developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable.  (For example the ancient Greeks believed that Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real.  Due to the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false.    Christianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are  because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind.  \\\"Oh wow..all i have to do is  follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness.\\\" For all of you \\\"found jeezus\\\" , how many of you were \\\"on the brink?\\\"  but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.   We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we die.        Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG. Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high.   It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars, of which Christianity has had no small part.  When Christians see a \\\"non-believer\\\", they say that person is blind to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day.  Jesus was just prophet #37696  who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans were (circa 69ad) dispersing the Jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need.

If the number is odd, then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache.  The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then it is on the polygon.

Matthew     Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on     Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material     posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).  US PLANETARY MISSIONS       MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed     minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the     onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the     Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted     from the expression \\\"R-dot-bar sub n\\\" (nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.      MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December     of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a     very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world     with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).      MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar     panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.      MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and     took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it     flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that Mars was a \\\"dead\\\" world in both the     geological and biological sense.      MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information     that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface     of an ocean.      MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away     the concept of Mars as a \\\"dead\\\" planet, first made from the basic     measurements of MARINER 4.      MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed.      MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to     orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no     other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian     surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.      MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe     did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed     Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.       PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph     the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide     new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new     data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft     had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on     October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.      PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first     U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally     designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead     studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to     36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6     through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,     and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would     have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.      PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER     11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to     study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through     1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever     to do so.      PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER     12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made     the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus     2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere     in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the     atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the     surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day     probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before     its batteries failed.       RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)      RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They     were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems     left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.      RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an     instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the     launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.     RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the     camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.      RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but     suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,     the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.      RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost     all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon     and drifted off into solar orbit.      RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send     back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact     with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras     did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first     U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.       LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)      LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image     various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO     missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our     understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.     All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were     essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.     probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar     surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.       SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)      The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar     module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the     soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered     in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing     vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was     strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.      Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the     first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images     and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from     SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,     the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored     the Tycho crater region in 1968.       VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)      VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on     a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June     19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse     Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for     Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes     found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of     its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was     pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is     pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the     thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and     boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.      The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran     out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a     weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep     functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command     had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until     further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the     engineers' efforts through May of 1983.      An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the     Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the     lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,     D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until     it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.      VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit     on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in     Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its     sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording     one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in     1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut     down on April 12, 1980.      The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.       VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)      VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March     5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched     August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,     1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and     by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare     once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to     outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,     but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.      Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their     satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered     that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and     aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major     surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous     volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.      When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets     and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep     the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive     jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle     is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was     startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.     The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,     kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.      VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,     continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly     monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was     found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational     axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on     Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10     satellites and one more ring were discovered.      In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,     including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright     patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were     discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a     canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)      The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their     on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets     beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the     location of the heliopause.   SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS      Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and     Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:       SOVIET LUNAR PROBES      LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first       craft in solar orbit.

MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit       with its flyby bus.     PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest         moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to         human/computer error.     PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did         enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week         before scheduled Phobos landing.      While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even     interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have     yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,     Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a     Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been     planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now     the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their     space program remains to be seen.   JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS      SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on     January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km     on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to     measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of     which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on     January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest     approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The     geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for     a Japanese spacecraft.      During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail     passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby     will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third     October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).       HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,     1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten     once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first     lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget     satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.      The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An     apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists     to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March     19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The     rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt     camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.      Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and     performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten     made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,     1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and     fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into     lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the     approach:   Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km  Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km  Inclination : 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)  Period  : 4.7 days   PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES      I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three     groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,     and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means     complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your     research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can     add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.      Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it     would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in     order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in     this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date     general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra     background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good     public and university library. Some of the more recently published works     can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market     bookstore.      General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):        J.

Other works and periodicals:      NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space     probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry     these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission     you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study     some of the books listed above.      Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL     GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's     Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,     SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER     missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the     VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.      More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions     can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and     SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major     newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,     but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events     were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are     affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you     probably know.      Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you     might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space     groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their     periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe     missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,     Pasadena, California 91106 USA.      Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I     personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas     in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from     it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked  at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they were 24, and noticed some interesting things.     For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also   found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away the second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc.     It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory.

The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be depressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damned thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just about (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working correctly is totally drop safe.  Now, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single documented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because he failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the proprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely prevented the office from getting shot.  The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire. This does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down intentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a 'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else. By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece. From the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of firing it.  The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that the firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the wide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be familiar with that particular type of firearm.\",\"Having been gone for 10 days, I'm way behind on my News reading, so many pardons if I am repeating something that has been said already.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?  A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability      of these products.  ----------- End included article -----------  \",\"  How about this description: \\\"An object that is, at one time, both a Euclidean square and a Euclidean circle\\\"?

This is roughly analogous to someone who has never seen a bicycle, and, when they ask for a description from people who claim to have seen one, are told that it is a \\\"Euclidean circle-square\\\".

ZyXEL has the biggest \\\"cult following\\\", and can be had for under $300, but I ignored it because I need something with Mac software, which will work without any tweaking.

First, i told her that if she was really serious about moving away from home to another state that \\\"I would do anything to  get you here in NC.\\\" I told her that I tried to find out if there were  any new stores planning to be built---but they wouldn't tell me.  About her marraige comment (I'm not gonna call it a proposal, cause I still don't know if it was a total joke or not) I more or less said that \\\"Marry me?? Well, get transferred to NC first and then we'll talk :) :)\\\"  Hopefully, what i said could be interpreted either way.  Needless to say, there has been a lot of praying over this...I  have done a lot of reading about marraige from the Bible. If she was dead serious about getting married---I wouldn't do it yet simply b/c she is not (as far as I know to this point) a Christian. It just wouldn't work w/o God in the marraige as well. I figure that if God wanrs this to go through--he's kept us in touch for 10  years now---he can handle one more. If God wants it to happen, it will happen!  She will be in NC in June meetinf some relatives so I'll get to  see her...and I'll get a letter from her befoe then so I know more of what to look forward to.  I guess all I can do now is wait and pray. I have decided not to tell my folks until I'm totally sure what is going on.  I do ask that everyone that wrote me to please keep this situation in your prayers..  Finally, I would like to thank EVERYONE who wrote in...  If you have anything else for me...I will be at this email address for one week. Please tell me anyhting you want...I'm curious how folks think about what i did.

Here's the deal:  You email (preferably) or post your predictions, AND the number of games you think each series will go.  Each round will be weighted, so that the Stanley Cup finals will be very important, but the early rounds will still be important.  Here is the scoring:  Pick 1st round winner, way off on games:  2 points Pick 1st round winner, within one game:   3 points Pick 1st round winner, pick # of games:   5 points  Pick 2nd round winner, way off on games:  3 points Pick 2nd round winner, within one game:   4 points Pick 2nd round winner, pick # of games:   6 points  Pick conference champ, way off on games:  5 points Pick conference champ, within one game:   6 points Pick conference champ, pick # of games:   9 points  Pick Stanley Cup champ, way off on games: 8 points Pick Stanley Cup champ, within one game:  10 points Pick Stanley Cup champ, pick # of games:  14 points Pick loser in 7, series goes 7:           2 points Pick loser in 7, series decided in Game 7, OT: 4 points (these last two are sympathy points, probably won't happen anyway)  Obviously, picking the Stanley Cup champion is important.  I will do some tests to see if the format is fair, but probably I will be too lazy to modify it, so the scoring will probably be like this.

The trap is the easy way out.  For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race, and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're going to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors leading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than not, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.  If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few Blacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then worry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable or whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to define \\\"us\\\" and \\\"other\\\" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational humans.  It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the *most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial makeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in San Francisco, a city that loves to tout its \\\"ethnic diversity\\\". Here, we have Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the \\\"model minority\\\") gangs, and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly troublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on the street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and crime are what they most fear. During the \\\"disturbance\\\" in Los Angeles last year many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I remember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs where there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned from TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives that live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly multi-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that in the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black* riot!  In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points that really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the racism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As a people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem becomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly believe that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current course of denial and repression.  I wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors, luck in avoiding the \\\"trap\\\".   Peace, my brother.    m. --    \",\" Yes, you could.

The 27th was a short day at work, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided to go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes behind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24 Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the  car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit, and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and  her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to  45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help them. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?  When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was,  but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the  Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle around it. I ask, \\\"What's going on?\\\" Someone tells me, \\\"Come listen.\\\" Well they were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \\\"Brother Muslims, our time has come . . . \\\" and something else along that line. I didn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to  get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter.  New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And the comments started: \\\"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"There's no need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\\\" I even heard that: \\\"All  Moscow is behind us.\\\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this  was no joke. I quietly left and went home.  Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh,  that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of  things, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.  My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku.  I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and  shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly, like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a  demonstration and move slowly.  My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd people are shouting \\\"Down with the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"Death to the Armenians!\\\" I waited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street  on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned  and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26  Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there  was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same  kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside  from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.  My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of uneasy and said, \\\"No, let's stay at home instead.\\\" An hour went by, or maybe  an hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say exactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on the side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.  I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside, and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time  there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more  aggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration. They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run  again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I  followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was  leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one  side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square  and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There  was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals. I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \\\"We don't need  perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\\\" Now what did they  mean by \\\"living like we have been?\\\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else.  But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense  of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just  in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it  anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.  Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians'  apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't  hear them say \\\"kill them\\\" over the microphone, I only heard \\\"beat them and  drive them out.\\\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then another are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and  I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB. There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try  to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.  Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no demonstration, and I had to protect my family.  I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next to the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai- lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some- thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City  Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I  saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the  cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15  to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried  off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe  about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha.  When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was  about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He  has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I  have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of  people smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled  around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.  Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting.  I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am,  I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags.  And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the  street. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag,  which had \\\"Ermeni oryum\\\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \\\"Death to  Armenians!\\\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really know what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is Rafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark blue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His  family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on  Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars;  their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the  left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a  new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son  was carrying a flag that said \\\"Death to Armenians!\\\" I was surprised because  before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being  done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.  Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \\\"It's OK, it'll pass,  they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up.\\\" Naturally I didn't  want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And  this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't  see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't  handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking  and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and  hashish to put in a store window!  So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one  would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again,  the police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't  breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time.  True, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much- vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people  died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I  couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be  specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of  Sumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.  When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \\\"Let's go upstairs.\\\"  We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the  evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more. I stopped at \\\"The Corner,\\\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I  look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to  the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old.  The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed  toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person,  wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as  though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more  noise, and the glass was flying again.  We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor, there was really no way to defend yourself there.  In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town.  On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or  what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the  bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying  there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing you couldn't even see him.  That was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.

Strictly, a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change state, according to the inputs.  A demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are three inputs required.  A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable input, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all outputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output will be low).  An eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to select which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your aim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note that this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since you have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left once you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.  A sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus a mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use the fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the four enable lines.  Of course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the four final stage decoders.  Please give me the credit when you submit your homework.

Currently I have   8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.   both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking   of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know   that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I   can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about   $400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,   the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that   the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather   avoid...  So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work   well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about   $90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how   do they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the   extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the   ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so   probably all of this is just wishful thinking...

Thanks again\",\"I have an 8514/A card, and I am using windows in 1024x768 mode   (normal 8514/A font, not small).  In the 386 enhanced mode  the DOS window font is too small for my 14\\\" monitor. Is there a   way to spacify the font size for the DOS window? You'll have to   excuse me if there is a trivial answer, since I am fairly new to  MS Windows world.

This version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendar programs and digital watches...   Please let me know if you know any other tools, or if you have information or opinions on these ones, and I will update this FAQ.  I am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people who have evaluated them or are using them.     Richard Donkin                            Internet mail: richardd@hoskyns.co.uk               Tel: +44 71 814 5708 (direct) Fax: +44 71 251 2853  Changes in this version:       Added information on StressFree, another typing management tool       for Windows.   TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS: these aim to help you manage your keyboard use, by warning you to take a break every so often.  The better ones also include advice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to   warn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.  Often, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening. These tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your  body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.        Tool: At Your Service (commercial software)     Available from:  Bright Star  Tel: +1 (206) 451 3697     Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows     Description:  Provides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info.   Warns when to take a break (configurable).  Has a few recommendations  on posture, and exercises.  Sound-oriented, will probably work best   with sound card (PC) or with microphone (Mac).  Should be possible  to record your own messages to warn of break.       Tool: AudioPort (sound card and software)     Available from:  Media Vision  Tel: +1 (510) 226 2563     Platforms: PC     Description:  A sound card to plug into your PC parallel port.  Includes 'At Your Service'.       Tool: Computer Health Break (commercial software)     Available from:  Escape Ergonomics, Inc  1111 W. El Camino Real  Suite 109  Mailstop 403  Sunnyvale, CA  Tel: +1 (408) 730 8410     Platforms: DOS     Description:  Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take  breaks after a configurable interval, based on clock time, or  after a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier.  It gives you 3 exercises to do each time, randomly selected from  a set of 70.  Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work  you do - data entry, word processing, information processing.  Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on  how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does.   CHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use   to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other information  on non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.  A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.   CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then  warn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear  useful when used with Windows.   Cost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.      Comments:  The keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better  to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to  measure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff  is very good and includes some summaries of research papers,  as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company   to pay up for RSI management tools.        Tool: EyerCise (commercial software)     Available from:  RAN Enterprises  One Woodland Park Dr.  Haverhill, MA  01830, US  Tel: 800-451-4487 (US only)     Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS]     Description:  Aimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to take  breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionally  displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are  animated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the  correct rate.  Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training   exercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitions  you do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes.  Also includes online help   on workplace ergonomics.     Quote from their literature:   \\\"EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic  sets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work  all parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent  Repetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve  your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these  help you to become more relaxed and productive.\\\"    \\\"The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C.  Godnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup  for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to  promote healthy and efficient computer use.     Cost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts  for resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US).       Comments:  I have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say  it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it  does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it  interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which  is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on  Windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure  why. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has  one window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not  require any sound hardware.      Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)     Available from:  Visionary Software  P.O. Box 69447  Portland, OR  97201, US  Tel: +1 (503) 246-6200     Platforms: Mac, DOS (Windows version underway)     Description:  Aimed at preventing RSI.  Warns you to take a break  with dialog box and sound.  Includes a list of exercises  to do during breaks, and information on configuring your  workstation in an ergonomic manner.  Price: $59;  quantity discounts and site licenses.  The DOS product is  bought in from another company, apparently; not sure how  equivalent this is to the Mac version.    The Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher   Magazine (Feb 1991).  Good marketing stuff with useful   2-page summaries of RSI problems and solutions, with   references.

Anon FTP:   ftp.cica.indiana.edu (and mirroring sites)      Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1) (Mac and DOS versions underway)     Description:  Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take  breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times).   Displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are  animated and program paces you to help you do exercises at the  correct rate.  Quite a few exercises, can configure which ones  are included to some extent.  Online help.   Version 2.0 is out soon, Mac and DOS versions will be based  on this.   Cost: $29.95 if support via CompuServe or Internet, otherwise $39.95.                 Site license for 3 or more copies is $20.00 each.        (NOTE: prices may have gone up for V2.0).       Comments:  I have had a play with this, and it works OK.  Its user interface  design is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual.  expensive tool around and it does the job.  It is also the only  tool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it  on your local bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers!  Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does   have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence,  which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.      Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)     Available from:  Email to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar     Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)     Description:  This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you  to stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously  typing.  It does not provide exercises, but it does check  that you really do take a break, and tells you when you  can start typing again.     Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing  today, each time it warns you, which is useful so you  know how much you *really* type.  It also logs information  to a file that you can analyse or simply print out.     The warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),  in a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message  (for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu>   has put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for   X, Zephyr and Mach.   Not formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk  (for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,  X Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give   feedback.      Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs     Available from:  Various sources     Platforms: Various     Description:  Any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming  appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.  Or, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit  a program to run at a specific time to display a message to  the screen.   Using Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and  include this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so  you get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you  want to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.  Press F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter  9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break  is for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat   for the next appointment.   By using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes  that set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this  file on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with  a single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments  with RSI exercises.   The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs.   An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job  that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will  depend a lot on your operating system.   While these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing   yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI   management tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to  write a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating  system, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.      Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers     Available from:  Various sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.     Description:  Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable  number of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either  manually or automatically.     While these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you  are writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from  a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great  advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you  are doing.       Comments:  My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to  my writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which  actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left  arm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been  very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.   I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but  these are not much good because they do not give an audible  warning of the end of the time period!   KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.   One-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how  you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing, and may therefore make matters worse.      Tool: hsh (public domain)     Available from:  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar     Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones)     Description:  Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.  Only works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or  an xterm, but not most X programs).      Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)     Available from:  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c  Also built into Windows 3.x.      Description:  The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout  that involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent  RSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since   it will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)   \",\"  In the latest case in Denver, they were giving away tickets to a Denver Nuggets basketball game.

I've been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties with Christianity. It is surprising to note that a large majority of people, at least in Finland, seem to be apatheists - even though 90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland, religious people are actually a minority.   Could it be possible that many people believe in god \\\"just in case\\\"? It seems people do not want to seek the truth; they fall prey to Pascal's Wager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believe reads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn't care - it believes, but doesn't know what or how.   People don't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle, they only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say that they are not \\\"born in the Spirit\\\", but this does not disturb them. Religion is not something to think about.   I'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless -  a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to. Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop, too many people take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow (and unconsciously hope god wouldn't notice ;-) )  : Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a : higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The : typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the : same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the : other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn : somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core, : than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it : expresses its own selfishness.  If logic and reason are valued, then I would claim that atheistic thinking is of higher value than the theistic exposition. Theists make unnecessary assumptions they believe in - I've yet to see good reasons to believe in gods, or to take a leap of faith at all. A revelation would do.  However, why do we value logic and reasoning? This questions bears some resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science: why mathematics works? Strong deep structuralists, like Atkins, have proposed that perhaps, after all, everything _is_ mathematics.   Is usefulness any criterion?

There is a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts without active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really beautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three deacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor. This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion that John would prefer.  But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations. Each pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracy against participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial blessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already getting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they should not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation --- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be necessary to go with the briefer options just to \\\"get 'em in and get 'em out\\\".  Each parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to their geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish in the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy closer to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow parishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors generally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly to the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.  Perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't follow the continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no single one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated equilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them, then the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering the names of the evolutionary theories.}\",\"To my fellow Columbian, I must ask, why do you say that I engage in fantasies?

Directions will ultimately        lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is        set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points       will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions       or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,       basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.     2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants       will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.       Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles       without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half       the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle       unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will       divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified       4x4s can run the course.         At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring   participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.   Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.  * This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles   so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be   street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section   of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper   from their vehicle :) .

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design     team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.       ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into     Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20     Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas     scintillation proportional counters.       CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint     NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian     system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini     is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.     After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA     trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon     arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an     orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens     Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of     Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours     while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the     surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter     continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and     targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the     mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,     rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's     satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.      One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain     down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to     peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the     surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.      The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the     first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of     Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan     atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan     Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true     nature of Saturn's rings.

Has returned     the first resolved images of an asteroid, Gaspra, while in transit to     Jupiter. Efforts to unfurl the stuck High-Gain Antenna (HGA) have     essentially been abandoned. JPL has developed a backup plan using data     compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from     the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve     approximately 70% of its original objectives.

Has made     multiple lunar flybys. Released Hagoromo, a smaller satellite,     into lunar orbit. This mission made Japan the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon.       MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire     surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity     map.       MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.     Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in     transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for     one martian year (687 days).       TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched     8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the     TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global     observations of the sea level for several years, substantially     increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also     will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.       ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over     its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields     experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for     various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.      Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of     the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from     that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist     manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted     about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole     in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its     perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft     that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!      While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and     radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see     *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical     detail, see the many articles in the same issue.

I'm attempting to track changes based     on updated shuttle manifests; corrections and updates are welcome.      1993 Missions  o ALEXIS [spring, Pegasus]      ALEXIS (Array of Low-Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors) is to perform      a wide-field sky survey in the \\\"soft\\\" (low-energy) X-ray      spectrum. It will scan the entire sky every six months to search      for variations in soft-X-ray emission from sources such as white      dwarfs, cataclysmic variable stars and flare stars. It will also      search nearby space for such exotic objects as isolated neutron      stars and gamma-ray bursters. ALEXIS is a project of Los Alamos      National Laboratory and is primarily a technology development      mission that uses astrophysical sources to demonstrate the      technology. Contact project investigator Jeffrey J Bloch      (jjb@beta.lanl.gov) for more information.   o Wind [Aug, Delta II rocket]      Satellite to measure solar wind input to magnetosphere.   o Space Radar Lab [Sep, STS-60 SRL-01]      Gather radar images of Earth's surface.   o Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer [Dec, Pegasus rocket]      Study of Stratospheric ozone.   o SFU (Space Flyer Unit) [ISAS]      Conducting space experiments and observations and this can be      recovered after it conducts the various scientific and      engineering experiments. SFU is to be launched by ISAS and      retrieved by the U.S. Space Shuttle on STS-68 in 1994.      1994  o Polar Auroral Plasma Physics [May, Delta II rocket]      June, measure solar wind and ions and gases surrounding the      Earth.   o IML-2 (STS) [NASDA, Jul 1994 IML-02]      International Microgravity Laboratory.   o ADEOS [NASDA]      Advanced Earth Observing Satellite.   o MUSES-B (Mu Space Engineering Satellite-B) [ISAS]      Conducting research on the precise mechanism of space structure      and in-space astronomical observations of electromagnetic waves.      1995  LUNAR-A [ISAS]      Elucidating the crust structure and thermal construction of the      moon's interior.       Proposed Missions:  o Advanced X-ray Astronomy Facility (AXAF)      Possible launch from shuttle in 1995, AXAF is a space      observatory with a high resolution telescope. It would orbit for      15 years and study the mysteries and fate of the universe.   o Earth Observing System (EOS)      Possible launch in 1997, 1 of 6 US orbiting space platforms to      provide long-term data (15 years) of Earth systems science      including planetary evolution.   o Mercury Observer      Possible 1997 launch.   o Lunar Observer      Possible 1997 launch, would be sent into a long-term lunar      orbit. The Observer, from 60 miles above the moon's poles, would      survey characteristics to provide a global context for the      results from the Apollo program.   o Space Infrared Telescope Facility      Possible launch by shuttle in 1999, this is the 4th element of      the Great Observatories program. A free-flying observatory with      a lifetime of 5 to 10 years, it would observe new comets and      other primitive bodies in the outer solar system, study cosmic      birth formation of galaxies, stars and planets and distant      infrared-emitting galaxies   o Mars Rover Sample Return (MRSR)      Robotics rover would return samples of Mars' atmosphere and      surface to Earch for analysis. Possible launch dates: 1996 for      imaging orbiter, 2001 for rover.   o Fire and Ice      Possible launch in 2001, will use a gravity assist flyby of      Earth in 2003, and use a final gravity assist from Jupiter in      2005, where the probe will split into its Fire and Ice      components: The Fire probe will journey into the Sun, taking      measurements of our star's upper atmosphere until it is      vaporized by the intense heat. The Ice probe will head out      towards Pluto, reaching the tiny world for study by 2016. \",\"  This is one of the differences between OT prophecy and NT prophecy.  In the NT, it is expected that when believers gather,   - people will prophesy   - the prophecy must be judged (1 Cor 14:29) There is nothing about killing someone who makes a mistake.   Scripture is scripture; there is no \\\"gift of scripture\\\".  And I don't know about you, but I know that _I_ have made mistakes while filled with the spirit.  If you don't give grace to allow people to make mistakes, they will never grow in the use of the spiritual gifts!  When we minister in my small group, I encourage people to speak out any impressions or images they think might be from the Lord.  Only by trying will they know whether they were right or wrong -- and in either case, they'll have a better handle on it the next time.  Didn't you fall when you were learning to ride a bicycle?  But you kept on trying, and you learned both from your failures and your successes. Spiritual gifts are no different -- you get better with experience.   The canon of Scripture is complete.  Does this mean that God no longer speaks?  I have heard his voice -- not audibly (though some have), but clearly nonetheless.  Is what I heard equivalent to Scripture?  No.  I have never heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the Lord is on the same level as Scripture; on the contrary, those who are mature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow believers for judgement.  And the most reliable yardstick for judging prophecies is, certainly, the Scriptures themselves.  The canon is closed -- but God is not silent!   Does it matter what it is called?  The question is not how to label it, but how to receive it.  Words of knowledge, incidentally, are similar to prophecy (and sometimes the two overlap), but generally it is supernatural knowledge of some fact that could not be known otherwise.\",\" But only in NY,NJ, Philadelphia, and Chicago.

The moderator replies:  That is generally accuate, but contains one serious error.  We Catholics do believe that God's revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in the Bible can be and is passed on through the Tradition of the Church. It should be noted that the Tradition of the Church, otherwise known as Sacred Tradition, is not the same as ordinary human traditions. However, we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to the Church.  Public revelation, which is the basis of Catholic doctrine, ended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  Nothing new can be added.  Theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications that were not recognized previously, so that the Council of Nicea could define statements about the theology of the Trinity and the Incarnation that were not explicitly stated in the Bible and had been disputed before the council, but there was no new revelation at Nicea or at any subsequent council.  Cardinal Newman's _An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine_, written while he was still an Anglican, is an excellent discussion of of this point.

Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it, and I'm worried that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens and paper.

Does He grade on a curve, does He cheat? That is interesting. Not to mention thought provoking. My own concept is that He is a Father and we are His children. In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understand until we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the final measure. From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is the final test. Specifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven and one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either go to one or the other. The \\\"grading\\\" on a pass/fail basis is done by God the Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For only God sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, \\\"...who can know it.\\\" I would say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method. That is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure. In an uncertain and ever changing landscape He is always the same. Yesterday, today and tomorrow. Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part of the test, my own conviction is no. Were that the case I certainly wouldn't be going to Heaven. The Bible speaks very plainly about the love and care Jesus had for and about children. The reality is that we are all children. Some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. But the Father, our Father is always there. Like most Fathers He wants only the best for His own. There maybe decipline, but there is more love. It's sometimes looks like Christianity is a test, to see who makes it and who doesn't. Those who do pass=Heaven, and those who don't go to the other place. But it is really much more than that... There are few experts. Most of us are just travelers looking for the light and the way Home.

It took just over two  weeks from placing the order.  The dealer (Rutgers computer store)  appologized because Apple made a substitution on my order.  I ordered the one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet. He wanted to know if that would be \\\"alright with me\\\"!!!  They must be backlogged on Centri w/out ethernet so they're just shipping them with!     Anyway, I'm very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions.   Being nosy, I decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the first time.  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected (must have come loose in shipping).  No big deal, but I would have been pissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldn't come up!  The hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine.  I've heard apple will exchange it if you complain, so I might try to get it swapped.  I am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off.  This wasn't mentioned in any of the literature I saw.  Also, the location of the reset/interupt buttons is awful.  Having keyboard control for these functions was much more convenient.  Oh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up. I've seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature...  Anyway, above all, it's fast.

It gives police the power to put innocent people in jail because they (the police) find something they don't understand.  Most police don't know what the return key does, never mind the difference between a core file and classified military secrets.

The burden of proof is on the user to show that it's something a normal upstanding citizen should have.  No one should ever be put in that situation, especially in America.  What's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it, to provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester or drug dealer, or whatever bad thing is in style at the time.  Basically most people don't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects.  As an analogy, it's like they find a loose screw in your house, and they insist that you're building a bomb or machine gun.  They ask you where it came from (like you'd know), and ask you to prove your claim.  When you explain it in such simple terms, people may start to get the idea.

If you want some data to look like an encrypted file, you just put an appropriate header on it.  If enough people do this, some of them will be put in jail.

Here is some  information \\\"from the horse's mouth\\\".  (Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media (\\\"clearing\\\") meant to  be *retained* within the controlled environment, or declassifying  the material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment,)  From National Telecommunications and Information Systems  Security (NTISS) \\\"Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation  Security Guidelines\\\"  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87):  ------  \\\"7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk,  cassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the  entire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be  cleared by applying a vendor's formatting program that overwrites  each location with a given character.  Fixed media (e.g., Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting  at least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by  applying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each  location on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that  this program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware:  some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not  actually do this.  Cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or  released for destruction; however, they should be marked and  controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of  information ever recorded.  7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media can be declassified using a  degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of  that type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.)  If a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is  operative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to  employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all  addressable locations at least three times by writing any character,  then its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros)  alternatively.  When fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify  the media by the overwrite method.  In this case, there are two  alternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk  pack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved  degaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the  vendor's facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter)  removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for  destruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new  platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit.  7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media\\\"  [see DoD Computer Security Center, \\\"Department of Defense Magnetic  Remanence Security Guideline\\\", CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE  ONLY]  ------  This and many other interesting documents (many that are more  informative than probably intended) on computer security procedures  can be obtained (free) from:  Executive Secretary National Telecommunications and Informations   Systems Security Committee National Security Agency Fort George G.

Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can be reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at mholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.  Mark proposed this design, which he calls \\\"Geode\\\" (\\\"rough on the outside, but a gem on the inside\\\") or the \\\"ET Strongback with integrated hab modules and centrifuge.\\\"  As you can see from file geodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much of the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte Manipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS) pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting can occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass properties of the Station change during assembly.  The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because it can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong part of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are limited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the docking system.  The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional launch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit (contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've never had a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to (performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual de-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the residual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from impact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating the local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing further micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember, it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.  The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment Gyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used for gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system which can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a controlled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like we did with Skylab).  The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be used for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity on humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device for the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on one of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.  This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical, data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work done to date.  Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City, and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter seems more likely.  Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design; you should see his notes in the GIF files.

But how do you propose we take government back?  They obviously don't listen to the people or want the people to know who is responsibile for what (a person telnetted the site of the Clipper chip release, to see what the entity 'clipper' was, and got a few lists. BUt when another person tried a bit later, the commands were disabled) Does not sound like an Administration that wants to have any accountability or information they don't control given to the people.  The secret development and implimentation of the Clipper Chip decision further backs that up.  You can bet unaurhorized encryption methods and software will be considered 'terrorist tools' and also subject to civil forfeiture, along with the systems that are running it.  YOU WATCH, SEE IF I AM WRONG.  The government is not going to be very cooperative about the people taking it back.

Waco might be a good example of what to expect...  The warrant (just released) stated the reason for the raid was the BDs spent a very large sum for weapons, over an undetermined amount of time.

A product cipher is a block cipher that iterates several weak   operations such as substitution, transposition, modular   addition/multiplication, and linear transformation. (A ``block   cipher'' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data---8 bytes,   say---all at once, then goes on to the next block.) The notion of   product ciphers is due to Shannon [SHA49]. Examples of modern   product ciphers include LUCIFER [SOR84], DES [NBS77], SP-networks   [KAM78], LOKI [BRO90], FEAL [SHI84], PES [LAI90], Khufu and Khafre   [ME91a]. The so-called Feistel ciphers are a class of product   ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round,   and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round. LUCIFER,   DES, LOKI, and FEAL are examples of Feistel ciphers.    The following table compares the main parameters of several product    ciphers:    cipher   |   block length   |   key bits   |   number of rounds   LUCIFER          128               128                16   DES               64                56                16   LOKI              64                64                16   FEAL              64               128            2^x, x >= 5   PES               64               128                 8  * What makes a product cipher secure?    Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is   completely secure. So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the   cipher ``looks highly random''. For example, the cipher must be   nonlinear, and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends   on every bit of the plaintext and the key. Meyer [MEY78] has shown   that at least 5 rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a   dependence. In this sense a product cipher should act as a ``mixing''   function which combines the plaintext, key, and ciphertext in a   complex nonlinear fashion.    The fixed per-round substitutions of the product cipher are   referred to as S-boxes. For example, LUCIFER has 2 S-boxes, and DES   has 8 S-boxes. The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a   careful design of these S-boxes. A list of partial design criteria   for the S-boxes of DES, which apply to S-boxes in general, may be   found in Brown [BRO89] and Brickell et al. [BRI86].  * What are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers?    Let E be a product cipher that maps N-bit blocks to N-bit blocks.   Let E_K(X) be the encryption of X under key K. Then, for any fixed K,   the map sending X to E_K(X) is a permutation of the set of N-bit   blocks. Denote this permutation by P_K. The set of all N-bit   permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S_{2^N}.   The collection of all these permutations P_K, where K ranges over all   possible keys, is denoted E(S_{2^N}). If E were a random mapping from   plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect E(S_{2^N}) to generate   a large subset of S_{2^N}.    Coppersmith and Grossman [COP74] have shown that a very simple   product cipher can generate the alternating group A_{2^N} given a   sufficient number of rounds. (The alternating group is half of the   symmetric group: it consists of all ``even'' permutations, i.e., all   permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps.)   Even and Goldreich [EVE83] were able to extend these results to show   that Feistel ciphers can generate A_{2^N}, given a sufficient number   of rounds.    The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the   group-theoretic properties of a cipher. Multiple encipherment is an   extension over single encipherment if for keys K1, K2 there does   not exist a third key K3 such that    E_K2(E_K1(X)) == E_(K3)(X)                (**)    which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys   K1, K2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key K3.  If   for every K1, K2 there exists a K3 such that eq. (**) is true then   we say that E is a group.    This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was   extensively studied by Sherman, Kaliski, and Rivest [SHE88]. In their   paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a   group. In fact DES is not a group [CAM93].  * What can be proven about the security of a product cipher?    Recall from above that P_K is a permutation produced by E under   some key K. The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that P_K   appears to be a random element of S_{2^N}, the symmetric group.   Let R be an element of S_{2^N} selected randomly. We will say that P_K   and R are indistinguishable if an observer given P_K and R in some   order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial   time. That is, with time bounded resources, the observer cannot   determine which of the permutations is produced by E: the optimal   decision is no better than simply guessing.    Luby and Rackoff [LUB88] have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers   are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by   random boolean functions.  * How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size?    There are four standard \\\"modes of operation\\\" (and numerous non-standard   ones as well).  The standard modes of operation are defined in the U.S.   Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 81,   published in 1980.  See the question about \\\"ECB\\\" below for more details.    Although they are defined for the DES block cipher, the \\\"modes of   operation\\\" can be used with any block cipher.  * Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication?    One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself   that he did or did not generate a message, and to prove to himself    whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation.  But one   cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key, and    thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages   that were authenticated using that key.      See ANSI X3.106-1983 and FIPS 113 (1985) for a standard method of message   authentication using DES.  * What exactly is DES?    DES is the U.S. Government's Data Encryption Standard - a product    cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data, using a 56-bit key.      It is defined in FIPS 46-1 (1988) [which supersedes FIPS 46 (1977)].   FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS.   DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA)   defined in ANSI X3.92-1981.   * What is triple DES?    Triple DES is a product cipher which, like DES, operates on 64-bit    data blocks.  There are several forms, each of which uses the DES   cipher 3 times.  Some forms use two 56-bit keys, some use three.   The \\\"DES modes of operation\\\" may also be used with triple-DES.    Some people refer to E(K1,D(K2,E(K1,x))) as triple-DES.    This method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985   \\\"Financial Institution Key Management\\\" and is intended for use in   encrypting DES keys and IVs for \\\"Automated Key Distribution\\\".  Its   formal name is \\\"Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key   Pair\\\", but it is referenced in other standards documents as EDE.    That standard says (section 7.2.1): \\\"Key encrypting keys may be a single   DEA key or a DEA key pair.  Key pairs shoud be used where additional   security is needed (e.g., the data protected by the key(s) has a long   security life).  A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a   single key.\\\"    Others use the term \\\"triple-DES\\\" for E(K1,D(K2,E(K3,x))) or   E(K1,E(K2,E(K3,x))).    One of us (Carl Ellison) keeps advocating DES triple use in the form   E(K1, TRAN( E(K2, TRAN( E(K3, COMPRESS( x )))))), where each DES instance   has its own key and IV (for CBC mode) and TRAN has been posted on   sci.crypt.  (It is a large-block transposition program taking its key   from the data stream itself, so that it is not an encryption program on   its own part.)  * What is differential cryptanalysis?    Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be   applied to any iterated mapping (ie. any mapping which is based on   a repeated round function). The method was recently popularized by   Biham and Shamir [BIH91], but Coppersmith has remarked that the   S-boxes of DES were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago.   This method has proved effective against several product ciphers,   notably FEAL [BI91a].    Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of   ciphertexts Y, Y' whose corresponding plaintexts X, X' satisfy a   known difference D = X+X', where + is componentwise XOR. In the   basic Biham-Shamir attack, 2^{47} such plaintext pairs are required   to determine the key for DES. Substantially fewer pairs are required   if DES is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds. In these cases, the actual key   can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs.   For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many   known plaintexts.    The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling   observations on the algorithm. Most importantly, if the key   schedule was removed from DES and a 16*48 = 768-bit key was used,   the key could be recovered in less than 2^{64} steps. Thus   independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES.   Further, the S-boxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that   changing even single entries in these tables yields significant   improvement in the differential attack.    Adi Shamir is quoted to say (NYTimes Oct 13 1991), ``I would say   that, contrary to what some people believe, there is no evidence   of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened.''  * How was NSA involved in the design of DES?    According to Kinnucan [KIN78], Tuchman, a member of the group that   developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying, ``We developed the DES   algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not   dictate a single wire!'' Tuchman and Meyer (another developer of   DES) spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in   Lucifer. They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer. ``Their   basic approach was to look for strong substitution, permutation,   and key scheduling functions ... IBM has classified the notes   containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA....   `The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep   secrets it uses to make its own algorithms,' explains Tuchman.''      On the other hand, a document called ``Involvement of the NSA in   the development of DES: unclassified summary of the United States   Select Committee on Intelligence'', printed in the IEEE   Communications Magazine, p53-55, 1978, states: ``In the development   of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient;   indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and   certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their   knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.''    Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA.   The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the   algorithm itself, just the parameters, which in some sense   resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman   presented above.  * Is DES available in software?    Several people have made DES code available via ftp (see part 10 for   pathnames): Stig Ostholm [FTPSO]; BSD [FTPBK]; Eric Young [FTPEY];   Dennis Furguson [FTPDF]; Mark Riordan [FTPMR]; Phil Karn [FTPPK].   A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson [PAT87].    FIPS 46-1 says \\\"The algorithm specified in this standard is to be   implemented ... using hardware (not software) technology.  ...   Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in   compliance with this standard.\\\"  Despite this, software   implementations abound, and are used by government agencies.  * Is DES available in hardware?

These are methods for using block ciphers, such as DES, to encrypt    messages, files, and blocks of data, known as \\\"modes of operation.\\\"   Four \\\"modes of operation\\\" are defined in FIPS 81 (1980 December 2),    and also in ANSI X3.106-1983.       FIPS 81 specifies that when 7-bit ASCII data is sent in octets, the   unused most-significant bit is to be set to 1.   FIPS 81 also specifies the padding for short blocks.    The four DES modes of operation are:   Electronic Code Book  (ECB),   Cipher Block Chaining (CBC),   K-bit Cipher FeedBack (CFB), and   K-bit Output FeedBack (OFB).    These methods are explained below in a c-language-like notation.    Some symbols:    P[n] The n'th block of plaintext, input to encryption, output from    decryption.  Size of block determined by the mode.    C[n] The n'th block of ciphertext, output from encryption, input to    decryption.  Size of block determined by the mode.    E(m) The DES encryption function, performed on 64-bit block m, using    the 16-key schedule derived from some 56-bit key.    D(m) The DES decryption function, performed on 64-bit block m, using    the same key schedule as in E(m), except that the 16 keys    in the schedule are used in the opposite order as in E(m).    IV A 64-bit \\\"initialization vector\\\", a secret value which, along with    the key, is shared by both encryptor and decryptor.    I[n] The n'th value of a 64-bit variable, used in some modes.   R[n] The n'th value of a 64-bit variable, used in some modes.    LSB(m,k) The k least significant (right-most) bits of m.    e.g.  m & ((1 << k) - 1)    MSB(m,k) The k most significant (left-most) bits of m.    e.g.  (m >> (64-k)) & ((1 << k) - 1)    = ^ << >> &  operators as defined in the c langage.

I do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re: Judas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use several of the above criteria, since you desire me to.

You claim that the PASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one another. (1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention; (2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death, as you claim.  But we'll look at your defense of this later.   Also, the \\\"reward of iniquity\\\" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew's PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at stating why you believe it is).   At this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural groundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.

One of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these passages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's explanation of Judas' death...   _____________________________________________________________________   HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING HIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \\\"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\\\" =============================================================   This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are constantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error. Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is destroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at all. Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and was crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do they necessarily contradict each other? Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that Judas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling something black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be true and supplementary. A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall. Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself. This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a pistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at the same time. On the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping form the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the case of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a situation of different perspectives of the same event.   _____________________________________________________________________   Your only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit inerrancy.  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely. Here's what you said in an earlier post...   _____________________________________________________________________ DB [quoting Tony Rose]...   \\\"The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so opposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.

But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  You can say it's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it didn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.   Questions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or are either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an alleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe in this respect.   DB... \\\"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:     Actually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer it because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\\\"   MY REPLY... I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother is on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a local hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.   To assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is \\\"begging the question\\\", if I may quote you.   [Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian Research Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these terms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM show teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]   DB... \\\"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\\\"   MY REPLY... Qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention below. Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we have re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's synonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But he lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can discover.

If so, should we do, as we have done with Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including their \\\"interpretation\\\" of the hanging of Judas?

[^^^ above, mine] No you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly probable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.   The Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New Testament.   In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus), it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \\\"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he was buried in his father's tomb.\\\"             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \\\"hanged himself\\\" [Gr. Sept., APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \\\"and died\\\".  Here we have no doubt of the result. In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.   Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply means \\\"hang oneself\\\".

As far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done, even by me. ^^^^^^^^^   As I said in an earlier post...   _____________________________________________________________________ Although I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable explanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria), I've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.   MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \\\"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\\\" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.   First of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of hanging. All it says is that he \\\"went and hanged himself.\\\" Luke however, in Acts, tells us that \\\"and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\\\" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the other details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle, etc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Matthew and Luke both recount Judas' death is highly probable, but not clear ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cut. ^^^ _____________________________________________________________________   I also wrote...   _____________________________________________________________________ MY REPLY...   Here we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed. Let's look at the passage in Matthew:   MAT 27:4 saying, \\\"I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.\\\" And they said, \\\"What is that to us? You see to it!\\\"   MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.   MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \\\"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\\\"   MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.   MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.   Notice verse 5...\\\"Then he...went and hanged himself.\\\" Matthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as a result of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ What does Acts say? ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.   ACT 1:20 \\\"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'   Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' death....So, my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the \\\"two\\\" accounts of Judas' death is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ say Judas \\\"hanged himself\\\", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in the hanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ However, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is no contradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'.   .......   MY REPLY... ...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records his death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be the case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ result of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ______________________________________________________________________   I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, but in looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.

The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted post gave us some...   _____________________________________________________________________ A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. _____________________________________________________________________   DB... Now truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the source of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is correct: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from).\\\"   MY REPLY... Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss this with you.   DB... As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically mention \\\"the reward of iniquity\\\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \\\"...concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\\\").  Now I would point out that when the Bible describes an act of \\\"iniquity,\\\" and then immediately discusses \\\"*the* reward of iniquity,\\\" it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\\\"   MY REPLY... Dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!   ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said, ACT 1:16 \\\"Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus; ACT 1:17 \\\"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\\\" ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.) ACT 1:20 \\\"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'   Notice that in verse 16, the word \\\"iniquity\\\" is not used.  Rather, it states that Judas \\\"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\\\". But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \\\"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\\\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?          ^^^^^^ JOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it. JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had said to him, \\\"Buy those things we need for the feast,\\\" or that he should give something to the poor.   So, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se. Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer, according to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of \\\"wages of iniquity\\\" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen by Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical explanation of what the \\\"wages of iniquity\\\" are.  What do you think, Dave?   DB... \\\"Now since I have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps you could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of asking me what type I think you are, as you did to Mr Joslin).\\\"   MY REPLY...

Christ was hardly the only person who claimed to be the Messiah--in fact, a number of \\\"Messiahs\\\" were active in the area from the time of the Roman conquest to after the fall of Masada.   Many of the statements made by the apostles--especially their repeated attempts to give Jesus a sword (give him military power) point to the fact that they didn't realize the true nature of his reign until after the fact.  Many of the statements in the Bible can be seen as being oriented toward explaining  this new definition of \\\"Messiah\\\" to the Jews who were being preached to.\",\" I agree that there is truth in scripture.  There are principles to be  learned from it.  Claiming that that truth is absolute, though, seems  to imply a literal reading of the Bible.  If it were absolute truth  (constant across time, culture, etc.) then no interpretation would be  necessary.  It may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different  from person to person.  To me, that doesn't mean that one person is  right and the other is wrong.  I believe that God transcends our simple  minds, and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly  this intent.  God knows me, and knows that my needs are different  from yours or anyone else's.  By claiming that scripture is absolute, then at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrong. I just don't believe that God is that rigid.   This is where the arrogance comes in to play.  Since these principles  are crystal clear to evangelicals, maybe the rest of us should just take their word for it?  Maybe it isn't at all crystal clear to *me* that  their fundamental principles are either fundamental *or* principles.  I think we've established that figuring out Biblical truth is a matter  of human interpretation and therefore error-prone.  Yet you can still  claim that some of them may be crystal clear?  Maybe to a certain  segment of Christianity, but to all.   Not at all.  I think it supports my position much more effectively  than yours.  :-)  So, I think that your position is: The Bible is absolute truth, but as we are prone to error in our  interpretation, we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out  what that truth is. Did I get that right?  What's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending  absolute truth, when we can never know what those truths are, and we  can never (or at least shouldn't) act upon them?  What practical  difference can this make?\",\"  I've never seen a speedometer-reading model. Are you sure? Who makes them?

Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, had negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield, now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent hitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime, he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't  know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are similar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field, he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his OBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important) was a absolute-primo-dick.    Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.    Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks  (Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been  a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.    You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers, simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you  blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month) Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one,  the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should  HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.  Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.    Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?    Now, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the position of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along the lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a  good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more recent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early 80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's offense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer :-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.  Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real stiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory, and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as SS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.    Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a \\\"mediot\\\"  candidate, pushed because of his \\\"winning attitude\\\" (a minor factor, if one at all), and his \\\"great defense\\\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of a tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.  SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about Morris' \\\"ability to win\\\" which is nothing more than Morris' \\\"ability to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\\\".  At this point, Morris is an average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned  close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the 80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year for Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but not favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF \\\"consideration\\\".    Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about \\\"Yount and Smith being shortstops who  hung around a long time\\\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's  just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre... (Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)  Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few more years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most likely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY  tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the league.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the end, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.   This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it  or not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.

San Diego: Tony Gwynn (pretty good shot) Colorado: Dale Murphy (a good shot), Ryan Bowen (just to see if you're awake)   [Before I get flames: this is an off-the-top-of-the-head list, there's probably a few deserving candidates that I left off, and, I didn't include Barry Bonds, Will Clark, Any Atlanta Starting Pitcher, Frank Thomas, Canseco, McGriff, etc. because I only considered guys who started playing before 1985)]   E-mail or post, I almost fear what I may have started here... \",\"I'm a biker and a dog-lover.  First and foremost, I want to mention some common sense.  If it's a choice between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is only one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first.  Second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent.  Third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social beasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are two types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which dominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible. But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh rapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!  Now, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a game, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one; when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of interception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to react to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of.  With a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures may be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important -- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the road, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up newspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The larger the dog, the greater your anger.  Dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he are not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.  Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped punishment.\",\"  You are conveniently ommitting the fact that the Arab governments told the Arab citizens of Israel to leave Israel, join with the Arab armies so that after what they felt like an assured victory occured, these Arabs could return to their former homes, reclaim them as well as anything else they wanted that belonged to Jews.  When the Arabs lost, Israel was left with a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back into the country as citizens.  What would you have done?  Let them in so they could kill Jews?  Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens  because they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn't leave.  Of course some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing between the two is impossible.  Therefore a decision was made based on secuturity of the country.   No kibbutz that I have ever visited has any \\\"employees\\\" unless they had to hire some people for the restaurants, hotels etc if there weren't enough  people ON the kibbutz to do them.  In such cases, they are paid properly. If a kibbutz turns away an Arab, 9I have never seen or heard of this) but it reflects only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz, not the whole kibbutz movement.   This just shows how ignorant you are of Israeli politics.  Although the  major parties in Israel aren't religious (however not totally secular), due to the format of the government (coalition) the religious parties have always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition. In fact, from what I heard the present government is the least influenced by the religious parties in the existance of Israel.  Israel CANNOT be called a secular state.  For instace, Haifa is the only city in the country (except for maybe some Arab cities) where buses run on the Jewish Sabbath.   There are many other examples of religion in Israel.  Marriages in Israel are NOT contolled by the state, but by Rabbis and Priests.

Chances are the government has thought of this, and \\\"just anyone\\\" won't be permitted access to enough of the internals to make a \\\"fake\\\" clipper chip. Chances are that the government has classified some details of the internals at a very high level, and manufacturers are required to observe security safeguards and clearances corresponding to that level.  While not perfect, it would prevent Joe Hacker from rolling his own spoofing chip, since not many counterfeiters can survive a background investigation. Some of the more notorious self-styled dissidents here, for example, have already got their heads so high above the tall grass that they'd have little chance of getting a clearance.  Of course it's not impossible that someone do this, but probably extremely difficult.

But back to the original question -- what is a workable solution -- what is a workable name that would imply the topic you with to discuss?  It sounds like there should be a alt.smartdrugs, or something similar -- I don't feel psychoactives would generally be used to describe alot of those drugs.

In case of the Earth z is about 23.5 degrees, I think. I do not recall the exact value.  In case of Uranus, z is almost 90 degrees.  u = latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured. Paris is at about 45 degrees.  North pole is at 90.  a = angular position of the planet around the sun.  As a goes from 0 to 360 degrees, the planet makes a full circle around the sun. The spring equinox occurs at a=0.  L = daylight fraction = (duration of daylight)/(duration of a full day). On the equator (u=0) L is always 1/2.  Near the north pole (u=90 degrees) L is sometimes one and sometimes zero, depending on the time of the year.  Computation: Define the auxiliary angles p and q by: sin p = sin a sin z cos q = h ( tan u tan p ),       (0 < q < 180 degrees)  Conclusion: L = q / 180   (if q is measured in degrees) L = q / pi    (if q is measured in radians)  Wait!

Most of the C preprocessors that         I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the         line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the         start of a directive.           However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol         as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines         that \\\"This\\\" is not a known directive.

This is hardly possible, as the majority of people in the world were born, lived their life, and died, without ever knowing anything about Christ.  The majority of the rest of the world have decided that he  is not who Emery thinks he is.    /(emery) /Why were the writers of the New Testament documents so convinced that /Jesus really did rise from the dead? /We have four gospel accounts.    I am leaving out all \\\"proofs\\\" of Emery's which rely on quoting the bible as proof.  Circular reasoning, etc.  There have been occasions already stated many times for later generations of Xtians to change, edit, or otherwise alter the bible to fit their political gospel. And if we accept the bible as true just because the bible says it is true, then (to be fair) we have to do the same to the Bhagavad-Gita and the Koran, both of which contradict the bible.  Enough said.    /(emery) /Yet we have no reason to believe these disciples to be immoral and dishonest. /We have no historic information that would lead us to the conclusion that /these people were not God-fearing people who sincerely and whole-heartedly /believed that the resurrection of their Lord Jesus was a real event. /And for what gain would they lie?

That does not prove that their faith is true or correct; it just means that they were sincere in their beliefs.   Being willing to die for what you believe doesn't make your belief the truth. It's not that easy.  And minority religions have always suffered torture; Muslims suffer torture and harassment in India and Bosnia today.  All religions are harassed in China today.

I've been seeing  her every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28)  and during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every  4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period.  As it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that  though I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she  mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13  weeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had  an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no  problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain  in my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very  difficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or  move unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for  when I do need to go out.)   Anyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from  the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about  2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.   (I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating  very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well  now I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile  related.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my  upper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I  was lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because  it started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt   no matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I  ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had  turned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if  I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it  wasn't as much of a problem.  So the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid  fatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware  of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have  been avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat  foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.    But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat  except fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts,  fried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I  should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only  have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day (  potatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in  a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or  steamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have  some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if  I'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it  from my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if  she's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her  recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on  cholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She  originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the  entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I  started.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and  she's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also  asked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them  are.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain,  and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did  want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be  temporary for that one week.   What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I  would understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying  that anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she  assumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that  because of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to  use the energy from the food I do eat.   Any opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm  truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet  because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few  minutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I  don't find any foods satisfying.  Thanks \",\" Bob is indeed correct here in more than one way.

In fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that.  The idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber handgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense, would, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't why I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it, and might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to kill people.   In fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses of firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer not to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what you say when you point a gun at them.  If you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to immediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work the best.[3]   Certainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing) aren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of them were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with having deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to use deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right, but my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and knowing how to use the tools to do that.  \\\"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\\\"  - T. Jefferson.  I think what Jefferson said is still true.   Not very often compared to other use.[3]   This isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is very rare that a non-violent person will suddenly \\\"get-pissed\\\" and kill someone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long histories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these people wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it.   Right, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I never have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from rodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than is necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them to drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that, I don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and ammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm after, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point, people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns, particularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.

In 1932, the accidental deaths by firearm per  1,000,000 people was 24.03. In 1987, it was 5.74. The decline has been  steady, consistent, and a fairly straight line when plotted. At the rate  of the last sixty years, it will reach zero sometime around 2025 AD.  CONCLUSION ========== Firearms have been a declining factor in accidental deaths for over  sixty years, despite rising per-capita gun ownership.    [1] = Year. [2] = Population. [3] = Accidental deaths. [4] = Accidental deaths per 1,000,000.

The bears are a national treasure, the area is their sanctuary and people who enter it do so at their own risk.  It is better that that rare human be killed by a bear than that bears be provoked or shot by unbear-savvy visitors.  The bears aren't having a population explosion, humans are so it is better that a human be killed than endanger the bears. I don't agree with this philosopy, but I understand it.   The psychos are a bit different.  They are not a national treasure but I suppose the decision has been made that to \\\"allow\\\" provision for defense against them would also \\\"allow\\\" provision for defense against bears.  Again, I suppose it has been decided that it is better for the rare human to be killed by a psycho than to take a chance on threatening the bears.   Personally, I wouldn't go into an area where I would be \\\"managed\\\" so as to reduce my safety ..... but ... come to think of it I guess I live in a managed wilderness myself :-)\",\"---------- cut here ---------- part 01/01 begin 644 1260wn31.exe M35KO 1D    & -$,__\\\\@ P $     ?#_'@     !0V]P>7)I9VAT(#$Y.#DM M,3DY,\\\"!02U=!4D4@26YC+B!!;&P@4FEG:'1S(%)E<V5R=F5D+@T*         M        _\\\"Z,#F\\\\$H0( C,N!PP (.\\\\-R RT !BT@ /J\\\\  *.T/LM00\\\"C<02.

What?!?   That last paragraph just about killed me.  The Deuterocanonicals have  ALWAYS been accepted as inspired scripture by the Catholic Church,  which has existed much longer than any Protestant Church out there.  It was Martin Luther who began hacking up the bible and deciding to  REMOVE certain books--not the fact that the Catholic Church decided  to add some much later--that is the reason for the difference between  \\\"Catholic\\\" and \\\"Protestant\\\" bibles.  \",\"   The people on usenet are clearly a special bunch.  We live the net, which is the future of our culture.  Usenetters have rapid electronic access to information.  Society in general must depend on CNN.    I can only hope we can make this information accessable by the public before the radical fringe, which _is_ the majority, destroys the fabric of this country.  Freedom is never easily won.\",\"  ^^^^^^^^^^^^ How do you do bus-mastering on the ISA bus?   If we're talking ISA (AT) bus here, then you can only have 1 DMA channel active at any one time, presumably transferring data from a single device. So even though you can have at least 7 devices on a SCSI bus, explain how all 7 of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card to the ISA-AT bus at the same time.  Also, I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book, but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93):\",\"  i'm sorry, as i have never heard of any of this.  Guess they don't think it's important enough for a classroom, and i was going on what i've seen in pics.(some movies--real nice scource there, huh?)  I just always  recall thinking that GOOD roads of asphalt didn't come around til the Interstate Hiway Act, or whatever they called it(60's?), and that wood and cobblestone roads were fairly rare up through the depression, except in overpopulated places like England and US cities.  Obviously netwisdom says i am wrong.   i knew it was almost always done, but i knew of no reason that it might not be done the other way by DeSoto for their car.  Seems like they had some other deviations from the norm too, at times :-) \",\" Sorry I can't help you with your question, but I do have a comment to make concerning aftermarket A/C units.  I have a Frost-King or Frost-Temp (forget which) aftermarket unit on my Cavalier, and am quite unhappy with it.  The fan is noisy, and doesn't put out much air.  I will never have an aftermarket A/C installed in any of my vehicles again.  I just can't trust the quality and performance after this experience.   - les \",\"  Yes, I have!  Wasn't there a case of a single lion ruling all the land from South Africa up to Egypt across to the congo?  If my memory serves me correctly there was enough game to feed some 100,000 or more lions but he wouldn't let the other lions hunt as he wanted it all himself.  He died of a heart attack brought on by being overweight.  Good thing too as he had designs on Europe, America (north and south), and the Falkland Islands.   \",\" Huh?

I was raised as a Unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as an agnostic, but recently I have developed the firm conviction that the Christian message is correct and I have accepted Jesus into my life. I am happy, but I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible and quite possibly about what Christians should hold as true. This I am trying to rectify (by reading the Bible of course), but it would be helpful to also read a good interpretation/commentary on the Bible or other relevant aspects of the Christian faith. One of my questions I would like to ask is - Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological works intended for a lay person?  I have another question I would like to ask. I am not yet affiliated with any one congregation. Aside from matters of taste, what criteria should one use in choosing a church? I don't really know the difference between the various Protestant denominations.  Thanks for reading my post.   Sincerely,  Steve Hoskins\",\" ...deleted lines...      As I live in Sweden I remember the day perfectly well. We changed side 1967-09-03 (or 03-SEP-1967). I don't remeber the exactly time but it was in the night. (in the 'big' cities like Stockholm & Gothenburg all trafic was forbidden, exept busses and taxis, during the whole weekend.) The day was a Sunday and everything was prepared in before.  Before the day we was told to follow the yellow lines on the road and after it was the white one that matters. The signs with arrows on was prepared with a 'left mode' label that was torn off that night to reveal the new right mode arrow.  The year after Iceland also changed.  About cars: Before the H-day (H as in \\\"Hoegertrafik\\\". \\\"hoeger\\\" is Swedish and stands for 'right') practically all cars already had their steering wheels on the left side. Even the imported cars from UK had the wheel on 'the right side'. At last we have cars with the wheels on the right side. :-)  More contries that uses the left side is:  Japan Tanzania (I think) New Zeeland How about South Africa?  BTW. Some sais that the left side is the right side because Ivanhoe and other knights meet at the left when they fight in tournaments. :-)  ...deleted lines...\",\" (good point about registration schemes being used only for harassment deleted)   I would also like to point out that this is receiving stolen property and is  no different than a pawn shop owner doing the same thing.   \",\"Mac Classic 2 4/40  for sale                1 year old, excellent condition        Includes dustcovers, freeware/shareware (including many fonts )                         $800.00    email or call 510/947-6987 (SF Bay Area)\",\"  What he said.

The above, while literaly true, is a clasic straw-man claim in the context of non-real-time circuits such as E-mail and the like.   I would modestly propose that a mandated use of ISDN would do more for commun- ications than this lot.   Normmaly DES.                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Note the use of the word \\\"business\\\" in the above. The whole tenor of this release seems to be establishing a ground rule that only \\\"business\\\" use is legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's ear to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate. Note that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only reference is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorized release' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who have legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info. These people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the keys.  The criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pens to go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well?

I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by the use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law enforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other coms is blurred yet again.                                   Lets run that line twice. Not **VERY** carefully what it says.

The ITARs seem to slightly impeed this.   Note that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret. Only the 'proper people' will be able to express an opinion, hence only the desired result will emerge.   Encryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly in equilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphers has resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT. I have no doubt that the factoring problem will fall in time. Probably fofr practical purposes by the middle of the next century.   It is a little hard to critisise a non-proposal.

The balance is between two repugnant points. The RIGHT to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the \\\"false assessment\\\". It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps YOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable, hence is defined in the govenment language to be non-existant. If you don't agree, you must be a criminal, as only criminals don't agree with out laws. Also note the non- question. \\\"If what is here was not possible...\\\"   It indicates we know that Bush dropped the ball in squashing that nasty < insert suitable retoric > and will stamp out this disorderly, unruley outbreak of freedom and ultra-national sentiment.

And one should ask herself:  is the world community really so powerless? Where are all those human  rights advocates? Where are all the decent people? Are we going to  let this human tragedy go on and do nothing about it? The number of Azeris murdered by the terrorist Armenian army and its savage gangs is increasing. On the one hand they wish to distort the truth and on the other, they beg mercy from Turkiye.          The Age...Melbourne...6/3/92          By Helen WOMACK  .... Agdam, Azerbaijan, Thursday          The exact number of victims is still unclear,  but there can be          little  doubt that Azeri civilians were massacred  by  Armenian          fighters in the snowy mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh last week.           Refugees  from the enclave town of Khojaly,  sheltering in  the          Azeri border town of Agdam, give largely consistent accounts of          how  their  enemies  attacked their homes on the  night  of  25          February,    chased  those  who  fled  and  shot  them  in  the          surrounding forests. Yesterday, I saw 75  freshly dug graves in          one  cemetery  in  addition to four mutilated corpses  we  were          shown in the mosque when we arrived in Agdam late on Tuesday. I          also  saw women and children with bullet wounds in a  makeshift          hospital in a string of railway carriages.           Khojaly, an Azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated by          Armenians,  had a population of about 6000. Mr.  Rashid Mamedov          Commander of Police in Agdam,  said  only about 500  escaped to          his  town.   \\\" So where are the rest?\\\".  Some might have  taken          prisoner, he said, or fled. Many bodies were still lying in the          mountains  because  the  Azeris were short  of  helicopters  to          retrieve them. He believed more than 1000 had perished, some of          cold in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees.           One  refugee,  Rami Nasiru,  described how Khojaly residents at          first thought the attack was no more than the routine  shooting          to  which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict.          But  when  they  saw the Armenians with  a  convoy  of  armored          personnel carriers, they realised they could not hope to defend          themselves  with  machineguns and grenades,  and fled into  the          forests. In the small hours, the massacre started.           Mr.  Nasiru,  who believes his wife and two children were taken          prisoner,   repeated what many other refugees have said -  that          troops of the former Soviet army helped the Armenians to attack          Khojaly. \\\"It is not my opinion, I saw it with my own eyes.\\\"    Serdar Argic\",\" Not quite true.

The people of  Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never  abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally  hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole  perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July  15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop  Makarios.  Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with  the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right  given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently  and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For  those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island  since 1571.   The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences  for this irresponsible conduct.               THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM  2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus  It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the 24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum.  AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS  The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed...  The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent, are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.  Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event.  \\\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs. Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain. Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard voices saying, in  Greek, \\\"You want Taksim eh!\\\"  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks, who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.  When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was brutally murdered.  In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying \\\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\\\"  I became terrified. I thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed.  An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who were all wounded.  We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik.  There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter.  After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus, Greeks arrested me at the Airport.  All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my detention. They then released me.\\\"  ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER  We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days.  We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some terrible sights.  In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A child's bicycle lay in a corner.  In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother.  In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head.  This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.  Today was five days later, and still they lay there.

Right now we  are witnessing the exodus of Turks from the villages. Thousands of people  abandoning homes, land, herds; Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless.

Article by Giorgo Bocca, Correspondent of Il Giorno  Date: 14 January 1964   DAILY HERALD (London)   AN APPALLING SIGHT  And when I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight. Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.  In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16  wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.    DAILY TELEGRAPH (London)    GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE   Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the  Turkish Sector of Nicosia, as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found  crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios, 13 miles away, were  brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three   more bodies, including one of a woman, were discovered nearby but could  not be removed. Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to   locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site.
