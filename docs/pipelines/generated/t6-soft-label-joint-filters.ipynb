If you assume the existance of a working SSTO like DC, on billion $$ would be enough to put about a quarter million pounds of stuff on the moon. If some of that mass went to send equipment to make LOX for the transfer vehicle, you could send a lot more. Either way, its a lot more than needed.  This prize isn't big enough to warrent developing a SSTO, but it is enough to do it if the vehicle exists.    Allen \",\" That's nothing.  They wouldn't let the British buy Inmos Transputer systems because of security concerns.  And we designed the damn things! \",\" Whether there is a \\\"why\\\" or not we have to find it. This is Pascal's(?) wager. If there is no why and we spend our lives searching, then we have merely wasted our lives, which were meaningless anyway. If there is a why and we don't search for it, then we have wasted our potentially meaningful lives. Suppose the universe is 5 billion years old, and suppose it lasts another 5 billion years. Suppose I live to be 100. That is nothing, that is so small that it is scary. So by searching for the \\\"why\\\" along with my friends here on earth if nothing else we aren't so scared.  What if you woke up at a party, with no memory, and everyone was discussing who the host might be? There might not be a host, you say. I say let's go find him, the party's going to be over sometime, maybe he'll let us stay.  Because we recognize our own mortality we have to find the \\\"why\\\".   This is a good point. But more of a good point for studying religion than ignoring it. Some Christians disagree with me, but it is worthwhile to study different religions and philosophies and glean the truth from them. To quote (of course out of context) \\\"Test everything and keep what is true.\\\"\",\"Reading all you folks things to do to illegally parked cars made me wonder who's going to carry cinder blocks on a bike(?!?!?) or is  ready to do serious damage (key carvings etc.) to a cage.  Then I had an idea--chain lube isn't just for chain's anymore!!!  It seems more reasonable to me, no permanent damage but lots of work to get off!  (Don't ask me how I know :)  Use it anywhere, the windshield, the door handles, in the keyhole, etc.  What a nasty mood I'm in. It's raining again...\",\"  Not to pick on Mr. May in particular, of course, but isn't this kind of the domino theory? When one little country falls, its neighbor will surely follow, and before you know it, we're all mining salt in Siberia for not turning in our Captain Crunch Secret Decoder Rings.   Surely the hypothesis relying on the least wild assumptions is to take this at face value. Our lads at the fort were asked to cook up something that's pretty secure, with a key that can be escrowed neatly, and they did. The government plans to sell this thing, for the reasons they state.

Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can be reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at mholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.  Mark proposed this design, which he calls \\\"Geode\\\" (\\\"rough on the outside, but a gem on the inside\\\") or the \\\"ET Strongback with integrated hab modules and centrifuge.\\\"  As you can see from file geodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much of the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte Manipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS) pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting can occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass properties of the Station change during assembly.  The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because it can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong part of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are limited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the docking system.  The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional launch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit (contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've never had a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to (performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual de-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the residual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from impact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating the local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing further micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember, it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.  The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment Gyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used for gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system which can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a controlled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like we did with Skylab).  The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be used for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity on humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device for the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on one of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.  This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical, data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work done to date.  Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City, and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter seems more likely.  Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design; you should see his notes in the GIF files.    Instead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for anon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.

I haven't seen anybody write that AIDS was a *punishment* for certain types of sin (this includes Mark Ashley who you were responding to here).  I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way that curses will come on you and others.  Although one definition of 'curse' is 'retribution', I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used the word.  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in his Bible.  God doesn't cause curses, he warns us of them.  Kevin Davis wrote (a while ago):  The Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death (which is much worse than AIDS) -- we have all hurt God with our sin.  Paul Conditt reveals his feelings:  The first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is \\\"obvious\\\"ly wrong to be angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angry which is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at us for putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was \\\"forgive them Father, they know not what they do.\\\"  Knowing how forgiving Jesus has been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of love for Him.  Please don't give in to anger, it will only cause foolish quarrels and more bad feelings.  It's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need to address it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone out there was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with AIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I would frame a response something like this:  \\\"It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which is simply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishment for people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of his children equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  We will all be judged after we die, but until then we all have the opportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him with all of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of our sin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new life for him.  Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is not to short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart or a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even through the worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all men that they may perhaps reach out and find him.\\\"  The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears of people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing is actually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in the earlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't been expressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount your perceptions, but please try to be open-minded.  You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people because they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters and I do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of the city and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with some brothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so that you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.  The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual contracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their salvation in that there may be repetence involved.  The important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God's commands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm or misfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way to prevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways, is to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife or husband.

I'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field. In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters, in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by  PANEL_MAX_VALUE!   As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h> contains the following bit:   /* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,   * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes   */  PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL = PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,    152),  PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH = PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,   182),  which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders. But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and returns value 0.  Strange thing is that DEC's port of XView gives plenty of space in a text fields, but not Sun's Xview...  Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me, and clear this problem?   Any help is very much appreciated.

Top three contenders seem to be AT&T Paradyne, ZyXEL, and US Robotics. ZyXEL has the biggest \\\"cult following\\\", and can be had for under $300, but I ignored it because I need something with Mac software, which will work without any tweaking.  The AT&T Dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability. They are backordered at the moment, probably because of the special $299 price in effect until May. Its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two modems. WARNING: AT&T ads say that the modem comes with a Mac kit (cables & all), and has lifetime warranty. This applies *only* when you order directly from Paradyne! I called ElekTek (one of the distributors), and they wanted to charge me $16 for cable, and gave only 1 year warranty...  USR Sportster for the Mac is also highly (but not as highly) recommended; it's only $250 from ClubMac, and if you are willing to roll your own cable and don't care about the FAXstf software, you can get the generic model from PC outlets for $190.

CONTROLLER VS9         The function of VS-9 controller is to load TV-images into  PC/AT.        VS-9 controller allows one to load a fragment of the TV-frame from        a field of 724x600 pixels.        The clock rate is 14,7 MHz when loading an image with 512 pixel in        the line and 7,4 MHz when loading a 256 pixels image. This        provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal        and vertical directions.        The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.        Video signal capture time - 2.5s.                       CONTROLLER VS52         The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM        PC AT or any other machine of that type. The controller was        created on the base of modern elements, including user        programmable gate arrays.        The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different        resolutions. Its flexible architecture makes possible to change        technical parameters. Instead of TV signal one can process any        other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning        devices).        The controller has the following technical characteristics:        - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ;        - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64        to 1024x512 pixels ;        - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024        pixels;        - video signal capture time - 40 ms.        - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024        pixels ;        - number of gray level - 256 ;        - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ;        - 4 input video multiplexer ;        - input/output lookup table (LUT);        - possibility to realize \\\"scroll\\\" and \\\"zoom\\\";                     - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external        controlling signal) ;        - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -        digital converter;        - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.

The goalie puts his/her face through a piece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face and forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic wrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, a plaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12 minutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the goalie's face.

Is this true?  I own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no   amp which can touch it at the price range. The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other    amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid   with massive heat sinks and very solid casing. If you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components    in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect   symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each   channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are   virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.  I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east   or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components   they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the   amplifiers sound so brilliant. I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with   those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly   hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.  My last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like   the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded   like new.  If you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will   sound brilliant and last a long time - period.

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to have a \\\"dirty\\\" amp.     Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,    that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs  Not possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.     for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt    radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet     away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.    If you experience the problem frequently, it may be     caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station    nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio     transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,    etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are    correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.     If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite    chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably    being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can    be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).    Good instructions are included with the chokes.    If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your    neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof    or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things    a radio operator can do to reduce interference.  And please remember to be friendly when approaching your local radio operator.  This person may or may not be the  cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most are).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes dealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b. interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.    BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or not he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it. Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers to take any precautions.  Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more than 10).  So if you hear \\\"This is WA1QT\\\" or some other call starting with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham. CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required to) and fire/police have other private ids.      \",\" Agreed.

Fusebox on other side of wall maybe? We started spec'ing Panasonic CT-1331Y video monitors (3 switchable input lines(vid & aud) S-VHS on one) <$400. This stopped the wavy interference effect on the computer monitor next to it.  Now on to your problem. You need what is known as mu shielding (very common, in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type O'scopes). I talked to a EE prof. He said get a coffee can, cut both ends off, mount around deflection coil of interfering monitor.  BE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY. ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGH VOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED. IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, DON'T BLAME/SUE ME!!! USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NON-CONDUCTING STAND-OFFS AND SUCH TO MOUNT CAN. Now, I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also good at keeping them out, so hopefully this'll work by mounting shield on monitor being interfered with as well. If not, start shielding those other sources.\",\"   Is there any Israeli a civilian, in your opinion ?  Now, I do not condone myself bombing villages, any kind of villages. But you claim these are villages with civilians, and Iraelis claim they are  camps filled with terrorists. You claim that israelis shell the villages with the 'hope' of finding a terrorist or so. If they kill one, fine, if not, too bad,  civilians die, right ? I am not so sure.   As somebody wrote, Saddam Hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting manner. And he also claimed 'civilians murdered'. Let me ask you, isn't there  at least a slight chance that you (not only, and the question is very general,  no insult) are doing a similar type of propaganda in respect to civilians in southern Lebanon ?  Now, a lot people who post here consider 'Israeli soil' kind of Mediteranean sea. How do you define Israeli soil ? From what you say, if you do not clearly  recognize the state of Israel, you condone killing israelis anywhere.   I do not know what was the pupose of the action you describe. If it was  to kill civilians (I doubt), I certainly DO NOT CONDONE IT. If civilians were  killed, i do not condone it.       Mr. Hernlem, it was YOU, not ME, who was showing a huge satisfaction for 3  israelis (human beings by most standards, Don't know about your standards) killed.  If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a  question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing justifies murder. I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make similar statements, maybe after eliminating all Israelis, jews, ? Am I wrong ?   Now tell me, did you also condone Saddam's scuds on israeli 'soldiers' in, let's say, Tel Aviv ? From what I understand, a lot of palestineans cheered. What does it show? It does not qualify for freedom fighting to me ? But again, I may be  wrong, and the jewish controlled media distorted the information, and I am just an ignorant victim of the media, like most of us. \",\"Actually not Jim.

He plays hard at all times, doesn't disregard his defensive responsibilities and is a good leader.  Bowman rewarded him be increasing his ice time.  Jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a \\\"me first\\\" attitude. This rubbed Bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time.  Throughout the year, Francis consistently recieved more ice time than Jagr.  Althouhg I have never seen stats on this subject, I am pretty sure that Jagr had more points per minute played that Francis.  When you add to that Jagr's better +/- rating, I think it becomes evident that Jagr had a better season- not that Francis had a bad one.\",\":  What is a general rule of thumb for sobriety and cycling?

The FAA says \\\"eight hours, bottle to throttle\\\" for pilots but recommends twenty-four hours.  The FARs specify a blood/alcohol level of 0.4 as legally drunk, I think, which is more than twice as strict as DWI minimums.

Does it apply to the purchase of : computers? I wonder if anyone out there has used it. Is there any catch? : Thanks in advance.  I am just about to post the results of my big computer purchase.  One of the key points was the ability to use my American Express card.  I  read the fine print between double warranty policies of Amex and Citibank VISA.  Sure, both will allow you double warranty on computers, but Citibank has a maximum claim of $250.00.  Could you imagine trying to get your monitor or mother board fixed for $250.00?  Amex has NO limit on claims.  Remember, if you use Amex, you must either send a copy of the warranty info to them in 30 days from purchase, or you must call them to pre-register and then send them the paperwork within 90 days of purchase (my pre-register pak arrived today).

While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here, it appears obvious that his speculation (for lack of a better or more neutral word) was at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance of current theory coupled with his observations.  It would appear that something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation into that theory (or to tailor the theory to cover the observation).  This does not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of fancy or a fantasy.   Well, I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word (also, \\\"extra-scientific\\\", etc.).  Nor am I prepared to give a general account of rationality.  In terms of examples, there is some danger of beginning to quibble over what a \\\"surprising\\\" experiment is, what counts as \\\"surprising\\\", etc. The same may be said about \\\"logical grounds\\\".  My point is that quite frequently (perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced to previously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses of some other theory or domain).  I would offer some rather well known examples such as Toricelli's Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his \\\"sea of air\\\" hypothesis.  Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) \\\"surprising\\\"? Well, given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must be counted as so.  Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed) out of \\\"perfectly rational grounds\\\"?  Well, there was a pretty successful and well know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit. The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty at the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it \\\"new\\\"?  Well, one could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new domain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you like.\",\"  Several chemists already have come up with several substitutes for R12.

Most people would agree with that concerning the younger son. The elder son is simply a negative example of the some thing. He thinks that he must earn his father's love, that he has earned it, that he is entitled to it. His father tells him that he is on the wrong track. He has always been loved--for the same reason his brother has always been: he is his father's son.  We are too performance oriented to consistently get the point. We are willing to be saved by grace, but once we are Christians we want to go back to earning and deserving.  \\\"Are you so foolish? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now trying  to attain your goal by human effort?\\\" Gal 3:3 NIV\",\"  The village I described was actually the closest I could come to describing mine.  I agree there may be other villages where the civilian population has deserted because it is too close to Israeli lines and thus gets bombed more often.  In such villages often the only remaining  inhabitants are guerillas and some elderly who have nowhere else to go. But for the most part the typical South Lebanon village is more like mine.  One where civilians and guerillas live together.  They are often inhabiting the same house.  Many families are large, some have members of the families involved in Hizollah, most others are not.  That is what is so hard of South Lebanon, Israel is not fighting an army with well drawn battle lines, but a guerilla tyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blends with the local populace.  Not because they are evil cowards that use women and children as shields, but because that is the only way one can fight a more powerful better equipped occupying army.   Hizbollah and Amal are now the main two militias.  Though Hizbollah people tend to be more committed to resistrance operation and better motivated by religious conviction.    As to retaliation,  It may be a mixture of what we both say.  Sometimes Israel chooses its targets carefully.  At other times it just sends its pilots on sorties aimed at a town in general since it only knows that the  attackers came from that specific village but has no further intelligence.  On several occasions Israel retalliated against  civilian refugee camps, even in North Lebanon, just to show that it will not sit idly after its soldiers have been attacked. Most of the time it directs the SLA to do the dirty work and indiscriminately shell some Lebanese villages on the other side. I have experienced this shelling myself on several occasions, this is why the SLA militia is sometimes even more despised than  Israeli troops.   I hope you are right on Israeli willingness to withdraw, but I still contend that withdrawal would be the better course for Israel's security, since it would reduce its  military losses, and I claim that the Lebanese and Syrian gov'ts would be able to prevent any  further attacks on Northern Israel.     Hmm...  Here we disagree on what serves Syria interests better. I think Syria wants to have Lebanon all to itself.  It would be willing to guarantee Northern Israel's security in return for Israeli withdrawal.  I don't think Syria wants Israel to be involved in its protectorate of Lebanon.  Syria is sitting at the negotiating table because it has come to accept that and wants to get a political resolution.  A renewal of hostilities along the Lebanese front could put the whole ME peace negotiations back in question.     I agree that the loss of any human life is deplorable and regrettable. \",\"I had the good luck to obtain an EICO dynamic conductance  tube tester for a song.

Vonnegut succeeded Isaac Asimov as the  (honorary?) head of the American Humanist Association.

This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the will of God.  Weatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts; intentional will, circumstancial will, and ultimate will.  He (Weatherhead) also refuted the last statement (above) by Michael Parkin above quite nicely.  Summarizing; _despite_ the failures of humankind, God's ultimate will is never to be defeated.  God's intentions may be interfered with, even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by circumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all humankind) will never be stopped.  Time after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of this process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God's intentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life and perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and deviousness of humankind frustrated God's intent for His Son.  3) Despite the circumstance, God's ultimate will was revealed in the Cross, as Jesus willingly (\\\"not my will, Lord, but yours\\\") died for the redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant, overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances.   It was not the intentional will of God.  It was the circumstancial will, thus enabling the victory of the ultimate will.    Right, intentional will.  (Just like the Jewish people  We know neither the time nor the place.

Let me give you an example.  When you watch TV, they have commercials to pay for the programming.  You accept that as part of watching.  If you don't like it, you can turn it off.  If you want to view the night sky, and there is a floating billboard out there, you can't turn it off.  It's the same  reasoning that limits billboards in scenic areas.  George.   It's called a democracy.  The majority rules.  sorry. If ytou don't like it, I suggest you modify the constitution to include a constitutional right to Dark Skies.   The theory of government here is that the majority rules,  except in the nature of fundamental civil rights.  I say:   Any reasonably in-depth perusal of American history will show  you that many WASPs have continued the practices of prejudice,  discrimination, and violence against others of different  races, religions, and beliefs, despite the law.  If you really are annoyed,   get some legislation to create a dark sky zone,  where in all light emissions are protected in the zone.  Kind of like the national radio quiet zone.  Did you know about that?  near teh Radio telescope  observatory in West virginia, they have a 90?????? mile EMCON zone.  Theoretically they can prevent you from running light AC motors, like air conditioners and Vacuums. In practice, they use it mostly to  control  large radio users.  I say: What I'm objecting to here is a floating billboard that, presumably, would move around in the sky.  I, for one, am against legislating at all.  I just wish that people had a bit of common courtesy, and would consider how their greed for money impacts the more ethereal and aesthetic values that make us human.

Blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration rate for violent crimes.  So I doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism present.  There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories.  Interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in the rest of the United States! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt blacks.  In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).  Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a situation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.  Blacks with similar histories (crime) to whites get the same sentences, except in the South, where they receive around 20% less on paper!!    --  There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of environmental disaster. Weird, eh?\",\"[MODERATOR:  Nice summary, Keith, thanks.]  I talked to the federal Dept. of Justice (DOJ, Ottawa) to try and clarify a bunch of things regarding changes to Canadian gun laws. I am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email, followup to t.p.g.  1. It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get    a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I    was told by a police officer. 2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to    protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns    must be stored locked up and unloaded, however. 3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will    be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.    The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form    authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.      Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these    'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will    be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess    them, but will not be allowed to stock them. 4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will    not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations    specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some     manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.    (God knows how much they'll charge for these)  This covers most of what we discussed.  I have typed this from memory, do not take it as gospel.  I am not a lawyer and I refuse to play one on TV.   --  -------------------------------------------------------------------\",\" There was an interesting column on the editorial page of the Dallas Morning News on Saturday by Walter Williams, who I believe is a professor at Georgetown (I wonder if he knows of Dorothy \\\"you're not in Kansas anymore\\\" Denning).  The article was titled \\\"Government slowly eroding our liberties\\\", and in it he tells a story attributed to the late Leonard Read who          explained that if you wanted to take liberty away from         Americans, you had to know how to cook a frog.  Mr. Read         said you can't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and         then throwing the frog in.  His reflexes are so quick that         as soon as his feet touch the water, he will leap away.         You must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it         up bit by bit.  By the time the frog realizes he's being         cooked, it is too late.  It is the same with Americans.         If anyone tried to take our freedoms all at once, we         would naturally rebel and suppress the tyrant.  But as         with successful frog cooking, our liberties can be taken         a little bit at a time.  The last line of the article says, \\\"It's not too late for us, but the water is getting pretty warm.\\\"  I'd have toagree that it's warm and the Clipper is keeping the temperature on an upward course.  NOTE: followups redirected to alt.privacy.clipper \",\"  Aw, just take a moment to digest it and I'm sure you'll see the humour...\",\" If the Clipper chip can do cheap crypto for the masses, obviously one could do the same thing WITHOUT building in back doors.  Indeed, even without special engineering, you can construct a good system right now. A standard codec chip, a chip to do vocoding, a DES chip, a V32bis integrated modem module, and a small processor to do glue work, are all you need to have a secure phone. You can dump one or more of the above if you have a fast processor. With integration, you could put all of them onto a single chip -- and in the future they can be.  Yes, cheap crypto is good -- but we don't need it from the government. You can do everything the clipper chip can do without needing it to be compromised. When the White House releases stuff saying \\\"this is good because it gives people privacy\\\", note that we didn't need them to give us privacy, the capability is available using commercial hardware right now.  Indeed, were it not for the government doing everything possible to stop them, Qualcomm would have designed strong encryption right in to the CDMA cellular phone system they are pioneering. Were it not for the NSA and company, cheap encryption systems would be everywhere. As it is, they try every trick in the book to stop it. Had it not been for them, I'm sure cheap secure phones would be out right now.  They aren't the ones making cheap crypto available. They are the ones keeping cheap crypto out of people's hands. When they hand you a clipper chip, what you are getting is a mess of pottage -- your prize for having traded in your birthright.  And what did we buy with our birthright? Did we get safety from foreigners? No. They can read conference papers as well as anyone else and are using strong cryptography. Did we get safety from professional terrorists? I suspect that they can get cryptosystems themselves on the open market that work just fine -- most of them can't be idiots like the guys that bombed the trade center. Are we getting cheaper crypto for ourselves? No, because the market would have provided that on its own had they not deliberately sabotaged it.  Someone please tell me what exactly we get in our social contract in exchange for giving up our right to strong cryptography? -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\" Gee, I remember the old 8\\\" FLOPPY disks we used on an S-100 CP/M system back in high school.  Not to mention those old 24\\\" multi-platter disk  packs that held about 15MB that went in the big washing machine drives at the local college I took some programming classes at.

So far everybody seems fairly normal.  I noticed a negative correlation with ear infections and length of time nursed in my very small sample. I do notice that the 16 and 18 year old seem to eat a lot, could that be from the breast feeding :-)  ?  I don't understand the \\\"unfit mother\\\" charge other than any tactic is not too low down for some folks during divorce/child custody battles.  Most of the developing nations practice breast feeding to 3 and 4 years old.  Are they screwed up because of it ?  Would they be much better off if they could use cow's milk or commercial formula ?  Doctors ?\",\"  Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however, that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet  away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding. If you experience the problem frequently, it may be  caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio  transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire, etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.  If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them). Good instructions are included with the chokes. If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things a radio operator can do to reduce interference.  -- \",\"  Koberg,   Just a couple of minor corrections here...   1)  The Churches of Christ do not usually believe in speaking in tongues, in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed to Pentecostal teaching.  You are probably thinking of Church of God in Christ, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.   2)  I'm not sure what you mean by \\\"signifying believers\\\"  but it should be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it ever, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian.  The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming a Christian in which one is \\\"Baptized in the Holy Spirit\\\"  That may be what you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order to be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the majority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in Mark 16 about \\\"these signs following them that believe\\\" but they generally do not interpret this as meaning if you don't pactice the signs you aren't \\\"saved\\\".   3)  I know it's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that has such diversity, but I think you've made some pretty big generalizations here.  Do \\\"Neo-Pentecostals\\\" only believe in tongues as a sign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message?  I've never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized them as believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as a sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not be inclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend, they do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be charismatic.\",\"I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population.  It is rather a ridiculous question in some ways, I know, but my newsreader is down so I am not getting any new postings for a bit, so I figure I might as well post something new myself.  Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core, than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it expresses its own selfishness.  Idle thoughts...   Adam\",\" I think your experiences under the Bulgarian regime are highly relevant. We have too many people with their heads in the sand saying it cannot happen here, as our Constitutional Rights are being trashed every day because the government justifies doing some end-run around the protections by a 'crisis' requiring 'drastic action'.   It is most likely that in the future possession of secure encryption tools will be regarded as possession of 'terrorist and drug dealers tools', and be some serious Fedaral Felony. Just like common tools are 'burgular tools' if the police say so, common computer programs (even computers themselves) are now 'hackers tools', and will become 'terrorist tools'.  BET ON IT.  The insights of someone who has lived throught this are very important. If the US goes the way of the old Soviet Union and its client states as far as individual rights, privacy and overall freedom are concerned, the rest of the world (remember 'New World Order'?) will not be far behind - only a few years.  Please keep posting anything you find that is deficient or that threatens ones rights in this thing.  For example, a conversation between a suspect and a lawyer will no longer be private from Big Brother eavesdropping.  Political dissent allready is very dangerous in this country, all it takes is the government to decide that enough people will take one seriously, then one becomes guilty of 'plotting to overthrow the government by illegal means'.  The phrase 'illegal means' is defined as whatever the government wants it to be defined as.  Couple this with Clinton's pressing for a 'smart' National ID card (an 'Internal passport'?), with the added wrinkle that anything about you and your past can be put on it, and you can only take the government's word as to what is really on it (since they will be the only ones with the means to completely read and reprogram the thing).  Isn't that nice?  While the Feds can bust into one's safe without the keys, the owner knows his safe has been broken into.  When they break into your 'secure' phone conversations (or other stored/transmitted data in the near future) you have no way of knowing, so accountability as to the legalities has gone out the window.  Just like a safe, if they have a legal cause, they can get the keys from the suspect, just like they can get the keys to a safe or the combination from the suspect.  Same with encryption: Record everything, get the warrants, THEN decode it with the keys obtained from the suspect.  This Clinton Cripple, along with its natural extensions, will make any priviliged communications between client and lawyer, and any meaningful political dissent virtually impossible.  Which is the general idea. Any propeganda about its being secure, and the safeguards, and all of that are just that - propeganda to reassure people so they will by into this monstrosity.  DON'T BE SUCKERED.  BIG BROTHER IS LISTENING!!!   \",\"  export.lcs.mit.edu:/pub/sunkbd..930314.tar.Z   /MaF \",\" First off, let me congratulate you for not posting a flame about \\\"You sick perverts, you are immoral, you are all going to hell.\\\", which seems to be the usual \\\"religious\\\" post found on the alt.sex.* hierarchy.  Hopefully, you won't get flamed, either.  You will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is built on unsteady ground.  First, I do not believe that there is any way to find an \\\"objective morality\\\".  Morality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a person or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even overwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.   Second, I do not accept the assumptions that you make here.  If, as you say, you are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by using the Christian Bible?  You're defeating your own purpose by doing so.    Third, call me a pessimist, but you won't stop the flamage.  There will always be people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we all are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the religion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring, overbearing totalitarianists?    Hm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to discuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I start off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex with you.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of your own gender.  (Just a note: I really don't know your views on homosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the purposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to have their faces uncovered.  The sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but feels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind.                                                                              (Evidence deleted)  I'm not going to accept your evidence for this.  You ask us to accept \\\"The Word of God\\\" that everything good comes from God.  This is only a valid argument for a person who shares your beliefs.  Still, I must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could be interesting for other reasons than yours, so good luck with this next part.   Hmmm...do I detect just a wee bit of condescence here?                                                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     not very objective.    One could construe this to mean that beautiful people are better, or \\\"more good\\\" than non-beautiful people.  I would hope that people relize that this is not necessarily true.                                           ^^^^       Might I suggest the word \\\"penis\\\"? It seems more in line with the tone of your post.              Bravo!  I respect you and your sense of humor, sir.                                                     Yes, and this theme is usually what the better stories are about.  However, they are not always selfish - I could point to examples in the work of Elf Sternberg, for example.   It serves the same purpose as it does in pornographic movies: it affirms the virility of the male involved, as well as assuring the reader that he (the character) has orgasmed.                         Your Whole Picture [TM] unfortunately only applies to people who accept your church.           In addition, if sex is for procreation, then  1) Why did God make it pleasurable, so that people would want to do it, rather than building it in as instinct? 2) Why did God make it fallible?  Not every sexual encounter results in pregnancy, even among Catholics.  Does this mean that they have sinned?     Granted.   Pornography would not tend in those directions if there were not a demand for it.  Many people have violent fantasies that they would never act out in real life, but will think about and read about and mull over.  Later,       Jeff                                    \",\"  Phew! That takes a load off. I don't want to live forever.  I wish most Christians held this view.  You can't walk across campus in spring without being assailed by fire-and-brimstone preachers.

But did it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920,  the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated  in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin? By the way, you still haven't corrected yourself. During World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]  \\\"Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)  when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it   becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon  method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical  operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing.\\\"   Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews - extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San Francisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.   \\\"...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities   against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the    murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian    neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish    and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see    the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...   Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise    to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would    help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of   the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.

The xpert mailing list is the general, public mailing list on X maintained by the X Consortium. The mailings are gatewayed, so xpert is almost  identical to the comp.windows.x Usenet newsgroup.    *** If you get comp.windows.x, you don't need to  ***  *** be added to the xpert mailing list.   ***   Otherwise, you can join the list to receive X information  electronically. It is best to find a local distribution; perhaps someone within your company is already receiving the mailing. As a last resort, send mail to  xpert-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with a valid return electronic address.    The xannounce mailing list carries major X announcements, such as new releases (including public patches from MIT), public reviews, adoption of  standards by the MIT X Consortium, and conference announcements.  It does NOT  carry advertisements, source code, patches, or questions.  If you already  receive the Usenet news group comp.windows.x.announce or the xpert mailing  list, you don't need to be added to the xannounce mailing list.  Otherwise, to  subscribe, send a request to xannounce-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu. Note: Only  redistribution addresses will be accepted for this list -- i.e. no personal  addresses. If you wish to receive xannounce yourself, please contact your mail  administrator to set up a local redistribution list and to put you on it.    comp.windows.x.apps is not gatewayed to a mailing list.   In addition, the X Consortium sponsors these public lists:   bug-clx         CLX bug reports and discussions   x-ada           X and ada   x11-3d          people interested in X and 3d graphics   ximage          people interested in image processing and X   xvideo          discussion of video extensions for X  To subscribe to one of these lists, assuming no-one in your  organization already receives it, send mail to <list>-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with the Subject line including the name of the LIST in caps and the request \\\"addition request\\\".  In the body of the message be sure to give an address for  your local distribution which is accessible from MIT (eddie.mit.edu).

[10/90]   The European X User Group was formed in 1989 to represent X users in  Europe.  It holds technical conferences at regular intervals. The EXUG also  publishes a regular newsletter which is distributed free of charge to members.  The EXUG also runs a email mailing list for members which is frequently used to address issues of European interest in X. The EXUG can be contacted at P.Whitehead@cc.ic.ac.uk, +44 (071) 225 8754, fax +44 (071) 823 9497.   GXUGiV is the German X User's Group in Vorbereitung (\\\"in preparation\\\") being formed for X programmers and users; it is associated with the EXUG. All interested should contact Olaf Heimburger (+49 30 7 79 54 64; and at mcvax!unido!tub!olaf).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   6)  What related FAQs are available?   Liam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posts a FAQ on Open Look to  comp.windows.open-look.    Jan Newmarch (jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) posts a FAQ on Motif to  comp.windows.x.motif.  Peter Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) posts a FAQ for comp.windows.x.intrinsics; it is on export in contrib/FAQ-Xt.  Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca) posts to comp.windows.x a FAQ on  maximizing the performance of X.  Steve Kotsopoulos (steve@ecf.toronto.edu) posts to comp.windows.x a FAQ about using X on Intel-based Unix systems.  The FAQ in alt.binaries.pictures contains information on viewing images with X and on massaging image formats.  The FAQ in comp.mail.mh (gatewayed to MH-users@ics.uci.edu) includes a  section on xmh.  The FAQ in comp.lang.lisp contains information on several interface tools and toolkits.  There exists a PEX/PHiGS FAQ.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   7)  How do I ask a net-question so as to maximize helpful responses?   When asking for help on the net or X mailing lists, be sure to include  all information about your setup and what you are doing.  The more specific you are, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without all the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are able to respond at all.   Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it  from. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system, give details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S  version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to  mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.   Then tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what you expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the  exact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote  doesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary  (just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available?   The trade magazines (Unix World, Unix Review, Computer Language, etc.) are publishing more articles on X.  Two X-specific publications include:   - O'Reilly and Associates publishes \\\"The X Resource: A Practical  Journal of the X Window System\\\" (103 Morris St. #A, Sebastapol, CA 95472).   Editorial information: Adrian Nye, adrian@ora.com.   - The X Journal is started bi-monthly publication September 1991 on a  variety of X topics. Subscription information: The X Journal, Subscriber  Services, Dept XXX, P.O. Box 3000, Denville, NJ 07834, USA. Editorial  information: editors%topgun@uunet.uu.net.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   9)  What are these common abbreviations/acronyms?   Xt: The X Toolkit Intrinsics is a library layered on Xlib which  provides the functionality from which the widget sets are built. An \\\"Xt-based\\\"  program is an application which uses one of those widget sets and which uses  Intrinsics mechanisms to manipulate the widgets.  Xmu: The Xmu library is a collection of Miscellaneous Utility functions useful in building various applications and widgets.  Xaw: The Athena Widget Set is the MIT-implemented sample widget set distributed with X11 source.  Xm: The OSF/Motif widget set from the Open Software Foundation; binary kits are available from many hardware vendors.  Xhp (Xw): The Hewlett-Packard Widget Set was originally based on R2++,  but several sets of patches exist which bring it up to R3, as it is distributed on the X11R4 tapes. Supplemental patches are available to use it with R4/R5.  CLX: The Common Lisp X Interface is a Common Lisp equivalent to Xlib.  XDMCP: The X Display Manager Protocol provides a uniform mechanism for  a display such as an X terminal to request login service from a remote host.  XLFD: The X Logical Font Description Conventions describes a standard logical font description and conventions to be used by clients so that they can query and access those resources.  RTFM: Common expert-speak meaning \\\"please locate and consult the  relevant documentation -- Read the Forgotten Manual\\\".  UTSL: A common expression meaning \\\"take advantage of the fact that you  aren't limited by a binary license -- Use The Source, Luke\\\".  API: Application-Programmer Interface. The function calls, etc., in a programming library.  BDF: Bitmap Distribution Format; a human-readable format for uncompiled X fonts.  GUI: graphical user interface.  UIL: the User Interface Language, part of OSF/Motif which lets  programmers specify a widget hierarchy in a simple \\\"outline\\\" form  WCL: the Widget Creation Language, a package which extends the  understanding of the Xt resource format such that a widget hierarchy and  actions on the widgets can be specified through the resources file  GIL: the file format put out by Sun's OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0  UIMS: User Interface Management System  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  10)  What is the ICCCM? (How do I write X-friendly applications?)   The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the  official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It  describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with  other clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need  to read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the  selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window  manager.  Get it either:  - as part of the R4 distribution from MIT  - in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys \\\"X Window System\\\" book  - as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, \\\"X Protocol Reference Manual.\\\" A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.  The version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to  the efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the  presentation.  [from David Rosenthal, 10/90]   - the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's \\\"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5\\\". The complete document is on the R5 tapes.   Alternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in \\\"RTFM\\\" and is the most-important of the least-read X documents.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?   The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of  cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software  interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.  MIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and  administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the  Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership,  Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).  Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail,  with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape, interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.   Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with  others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification is produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium as a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public  review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.  Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or  Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.  Write to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer  Science, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.

OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK was developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was developed by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF  members.    OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide;  there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications. Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the  one from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce  programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's  (formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a \\\"virtual toolkit\\\" which provides objects in the style of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.   OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising  their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.  [Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?   Open Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system  that combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface  specification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including the SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and a number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).  [thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?   DECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI  toolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a  session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar,  dxpsview, etc.).  (At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.) [8/90]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  15)  What is PEX?   PEX is the \\\"PHiGS Extension to X\\\".  PHiGS stands for \\\"Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics  System\\\" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation  and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in  hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension  allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized  hardware for 3D graphics.  Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely  redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample implementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release. Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for  their workstations and X terminals.  [last modified 10/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  16)  What is \\\"low-bandwidth X\\\" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?  There are several options for using X over serial lines:  SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP packets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years, and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations. Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really  ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per  packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully  so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links).   CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the  40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do  anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help, but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed  data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).  PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than SLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial  line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for  running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable.  XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition  to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes  redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and  using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a  pseudo-X server or \\\"proxy\\\" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There  are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:    (1) You don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't   otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly   connected), and    (2) It reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that  have to cross the serial interface, and    (3) In addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering   packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for   blocks to compress.  LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a standard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using  NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information  (e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps,  etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a  Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample  implementation available in R6.  Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/ in the following files:         XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote         XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX  [information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]   There is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk at the 7th MIT X Technical Conference.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?   The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the X window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is no single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways  for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout, decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order (generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):   wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3  uwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed,  although it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.  twm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window  managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a re-parenting window manager.   awm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers  cwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system.   rtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.  dxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering  hpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm  mwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit  tekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering   olwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style Guide functionality  olwm (AT&T): ditto  gwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in Lisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on avahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]  m_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape  pswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release  swm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple GUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes from the resources file  twm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked twm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape  vtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a single-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available on archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available  from export. [3/92]  tvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is available on archive servers  olvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is  available on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.  mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version is floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a  source license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].  NCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look   XDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals   ctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5  twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export. Version 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.  vuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.  4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM  piewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?   It needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your  window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X  session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your  window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in the background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:   exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action. Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window,  whether or not you kill or restart your window manager.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?   Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature -- which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the geometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something  close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are  looking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces.  Look for the application \\\"xplaces\\\" on an archive-server near you. There are  several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage. [10/90]  Some new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the  saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running applications and the resource database.  [Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?   DEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this,  add to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:  sm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?   You can turn auto-repeat on or off by using \\\"xset r on|off\\\". The X protocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is a capability not supported by all systems.  Some servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over  server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the  server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server  from MIT with the options \\\"-ar1 350 -ar2 30\\\" to reduce the sensitivity of the  keyboard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?   There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful  for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and  does not do \\\"macro expansion.\\\"  Some (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors,  accept a translation resource such as:  xterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\\\   <Key>F1: string(\\\"setenv DISPLAY unix:0\\\") which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control characters in the string, use \\\\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include.  Window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor has a special \\\"remapper\\\" client been made available.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  David B.

Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force air into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake valve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only the difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after the exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the intake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time does the pressure ever become \\\"negative\\\", or even approach a good vacuum.  2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up to the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume that must flow through the intake, because of the temperature difference and the products of combustion.  3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty horsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes, substitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost zero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very well anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make very little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is _much_ louder than the stocker.  4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor. If free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference was noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.  5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any given RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it on the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower. Pumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\",\"  Maybe cyclical is not the best word.

(Or is it only applicable in cases like this?)  :-  I remember an article of about a year ago which stated that besides his wife, Saddam also has a mistress.  Assad's brother has a wife and *several* mistresses, and those 'emirs' in the Gulf have, within their lifetimes, wives in the double digitas (only they manage to keep four at a time).   This is all irrelevant.  It takes a *lot* more than infidelity to make these leaders ruthless and corrupt.  Maybe Netanyahu thought he could 'cleanse' himself by making such a public confession.

Maddison and Hamilton were both studying existing forms of government for several years before they wrote the federalist papers. That the US system is based to a considerable degree on the UK model is pretty widely accepted. At the time there was no other major country with a representative body. The French plebicite had been suppressed for 140 years and its restoration eight years later would mark the start of the French revolution.   After the UK system the major influences were the Dutch system and of course the classical systems. Nobody seriously suggests that Rome or Greece were  models though because the political systems of both countries were acknowleged disasters. The main lesson learnt from Greece was that unless a federal state was constructed a war would be inevitable. The Greek democracies were always fighting amongst themselves which is how Rome managed to invade. Had the federal consitution been rejected the new Roman empire in the shape of Britain would quite certainly have reabsorbed much of the colonies in due course. Moreover the states would have been at each others throats as soon as the Louisiana purchase situation arose during the Napoleonic period. \",\" It's there.....\",\"Cathy Smith posting for L.

XAllocColor is supposed to do the following in order:     Try to find an exact match read-only color cell. (within hardware limits)     Try to allocate a read-only colorcell and set it to match.  and when all else fails,      Return the colorcell with the best match from the read-only colors      already allocated in the colormap.  This sounds good in theory.  It doesn't seem to work this way though.  If there is no exact match already in the colormap, and  no unallocated cells, then XAllocColor fails, even when it has  already allocated several other cells already, and there are dozens  of read-only cells already in the colormap.

I have favored it for these reasons  you mention, that the income base is too hazy to define, that it taxes  savings and investment, that it is likely to be more visible.  He agreed,  and reported that the CEA at that time was in favor of VAT.  So why not  propose it?  I asked.

In paraphrase: \",\"  Ed of course has never demonstrated remarkable knowlege of socialism,  or any other political system come to that.   That leaves Germany, Japan and the UK as examples of a country where the right wing government is on the verge of collapse. Oh and of course the USA which just elected a socialist government :-)   Etc, unfortunately you can't pin this on the left or the right, both are to blame. Both sides are equally deep into the corruption scandal. The only  untained party is the northern league which is a bunch of nationalist separatists and the communist party which has collapsed.    Ed should take a look at the budget deficit Regan and Bush created together before he starts to make claims about europe collapsing based on the budget deficits here. None of them are serious on the USA scale.  And here in Europe we have zero interest in Ed-Ipser type freed thank you. We do not want our countries to be run by a narrow elite of rich lawyers for the benefit of the super wealthy. We are quite happy with social  democracy and despite the fuss made in Time and Newsweek there is remarkably little being done to reverse the social welfare reforms brought in by socialism.  The problem with socialism is that it started with the aims of free education and health care and provision of the welfare state. This has been achieved across the whole of Europe, only the USA is struggling to catch up. The problem for socialism is what to do now it has succeeded.    Ed starts to discus LA, presumably he thinks that it is in Europe. On the other hand he most probably hasn't heard of a European city.   Rather the opposite. What is happening in Italy is that the communist party has collapsed. This has meant that the grand coalition between right and left wing parties to keep out the communists has also collapsed. The  magistrates have seized this opportunity to crack down hard on fraud and  corruption and have arrested half the politicians. The fact that the socialists are in charge this week is incidental, the right is into the corruption just as baddly.  What looks likely to happen is the fringe parties are going to do much better in the next election. Most of the parliamentary deputies are going to get replaced and the parties are going to be forced to look to people who are free of any hint of corruption.

The difference now is that such strains have become virulent.  In the old days, such TB was weak.  It didn't spread to other people very easily and just infected the one person in whom it developed (because of non-compliance with medications).  Non-compliance and development of resistant strains has been a problem for a very long time.  That is why we have like 9 drugs against TB.  There is always a need to develop new ones due to such strains.  Now, however, with a virulent resistant strain, we are in more trouble, and measures to assure compliance may be necessary even if they entail force.  --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\"As our local.religion.christian BBS group seems moribund, I'm posting here.  On one of the Sundays just before Easter I went to church.  The sermon was based on a story in the Book of Joshua.  (The one about Joshua sending out spies to the land he was planning to take)  What I particularly remember, because of having heard part of a CBC radio documentary on Bosnia, was that the Rahab (the woman who sheltered the spies) said that the people were \\\"melting in fear.\\\"  What with having heard that CBC radio documentary and knowing that the Muslims in Bosnia were losing the war, I felt uncomfortable.  After all, the Serbs are driving non-Christians out.  On the other hand, ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the values held by our secular society.  Anyhow members of that church are involved in out-of-country missionary work.  Also, the pastor has talked of spiritual warfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area.  The next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites take Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except for Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about Bosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that the massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered me was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I shouldn't be so troubled about the reports of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" in Bosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims. Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing God's work?\",\" Adobe has been doing this for years.

Customers included government (including NASA), for profit and non-profit companies. All expected a wrap (usually called a fee). Much of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors. The subcontractors where universities, for-profits, non-profits, and even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space. ALL charged fees as part of the work. Down the street is one of the NASA commercialization centers; they charge a fee.  Now, I'm sure your a competent engineer Dennis, but you clearly lack experience in several areas. Your posts show that you don't understand the importance of integration in large projects. You also show a lack of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything. This isn't a flame, jsut a statement.  Your employer DOES charge a fee. You may not see it but you do.    Well there you are Dennis. As I said, they simply include the fee in their overhead. Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depending on the customer.   Integration, Dennis, isn't overhead.   Dennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs. When WP 02 was hemoraging out a billion $$, the centers you love so much where doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem. Reston was the only place you would find people actually interested in solving the problems and building a station.   When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that integration isn't overhead. It is the single most important part of a successful large scale effort.   The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on Congress. Suprise suprise. The fact remains that it is the centers you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address the problems until the press published the story.  Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address the overruns? You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns?   You should know Dennis that NASA doesn't include transport costs for resuply. That comes from the Shuttle budget. What they where saying is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport.   I do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of Reston to ask that the problems with WP 02 be addressed.

There is an option (BIOS I think) where additional wait(s) can be added with regard to CPU/VL bus transactions.  This slows the CPU down to a rate that gives the VL bus device(s) time to 'do their thing'.  These particular wait(s) are applied when the CPU transacts with VL bus device(s).  You want to enable these wait(s) only if you are using a 50-DX with VL bus devices.  This is from reading my motherboard manual, and these are my interpre- tations.  Your mileage may vary.

Neil Smith                             WEIRD SCIENCE  Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips  move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are  politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase  \\\"political science\\\" is subject to more than one interpretation.    Years ago, we heard how \\\"scientists\\\" were worried that a new Ice  Age might be coming, and later on that \\\"nuclear winter\\\" -- smoke  and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international  unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even  have killed the dinosaurs.    What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this,  that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended  to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken  values that made America the most successful culture in history,  and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague  when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.    We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William  Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't  supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least  100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never  know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit  their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and  that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.    But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of  science as they are of everything, they trust \\\"scientists\\\" to  unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's \\\"scientists\\\"  have agendas of their own.    Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is  going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that  there is no respectable evidence for \\\"global warming\\\".  The money  and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and  they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical  crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.    The same appears true of \\\"acid rain\\\", a deliberate hoax cooked up  by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private  industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and  foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on  specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.    The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.   \\\"Ozone depletion\\\", for which evidence is even more suspect and  contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than  a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era  when state central planning and the command economy have failed and  can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.    Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth  and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear  power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy  known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount  of energy there is available to any individual in society, the  freer that individual -- and his society -- become.    Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and  self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as  ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive  reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have  been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.    And what the media didn't say about recent EPA \\\"discoveries\\\" on the  effect of \\\"secondhand smoking\\\" is that, although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of  magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a  week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether  there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.    That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically  correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice  to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy  practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's  science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is  highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet  the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There  isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of  government money on the scientific establishment.    Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies  to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one  time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and  religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has  tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of  abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street  -- has wound up being shed.    Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's  lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of  livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate,  to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels  for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates,  when they die from the effects of obesity.    What we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two  more centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of  state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable;  real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will  simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and  everyone will benefit.    L.

Recognizing that most of the military requirements for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say, has the shuttle  ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability?

Brett himself has actually posted the data previously. What declined from 84 to 89, as I remember it, was _percent increase_in_deficit_growth, i.e. the rate of growth of the deficit  (2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time) decreased. Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit declined.  If you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keeps growing.  If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowed previously, the deficit increases.  You only decrease deficits when your income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.  Figgie's book paints the real data, pictorially, in gory detail.

People cause economic activity.  More can be  explained by watching population waves roll through the years and  create cycles.  He has made models and predictions for years well into the middle of next century.  It will be neat to see how accurate he is.\",\"    On Palm Sunday at our parish, we were \\\"invited\\\" to take the role of Jesus in the Passion.  I declined to participate.  Last year at the liturgy meeting I pointed out how we crucify Christ by our sins, so therefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd, but to no avail.      As a member of a liturgy committee, I can tell you that the problem is certain people dominating, who want to try out all kinds of innovations.  The priests don't seem even to _want_ to make any decisions of their own in many cases.  I guess it's easier to \\\"try something new\\\" than it is to refuse to allow it.     At our parish on Holy Thursday, instead of the priests washing feet (\\\"Who wants to get around people's feet,\\\" according to one of our priests) the congregation was \\\"invited\\\" to come up and help wash one another's hands.     The symbolism of this action distressed me, and again I refused to participate.  I thought that if we were to have to come up with rubrics for this liturgical action (i.e. \\\"Body of Christ\\\" -- \\\"Amen\\\" for receiving Communion), that they could be \\\"I am not responsible for the blood of this man.\\\"     Also for part of the Eucharistic Prayer (\\\"Blessed are You, God of all creation...\\\") was substituted some text read by a lay couple.  The priest certainly should not have given this part of the Mass over to others, and I was so disturbed that I declined to receive Communion that night (we aren't required to anyway -- I instead offered up prayers for our priests and parish).      The quality of the Mass has not changed.  Again, if it were to be celebrated according to the rubrics set down by the Church, it would still be \\\"liturgically\\\" beautiful.  The problem comes about from people trying to be \\\"creative\\\" who are not.     I think the answer to your question on participation could be that given by Father Peter Stravinskas in answer to the question posed by the title of Thomas Day's _Why Catholics Can't Sing_.  \\\"They don't want to\\\" because of all this nonsense.     By the way, for any non-Catholics reading this, the problem does not reflect bad liturgy by the Catholic Church, but by those who are disobedient to the Church in changing it on their own \\\"authority.\\\"\",\"I have a 1982 Regal and I am interested in buying a fiberglass hood, trunk, and bumpers for it.

Yes (2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000  running at 15.87 Mhz. (3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a  lot of memory. (4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors  that still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors  sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell  memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most  memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether  the Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine  California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB -  $140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that  are selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here. (5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an  average access time of about 25 ms. (6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a  backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move  your head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or  non-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.  Other things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay  for it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to  sell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about  $650.

Incidentally, my MP has responded to my questions on that issue, and it appears that the UK and other `approved' countries will get the secure A5 encryption, and `dodgy' countries will get A5X.  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used with A5X systems, but newer equipment will use A5/A5X/clear depending on the capabilities of the base station.  The cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key to listen in to cellular conversations.  Encryption is not end-to-end, but  cellphone to base-station - it *has* to be this way so that cellular users and fixed installations can talk to each other.  For cellular to cellular calls, the transmission is decrypted at the base-station, passed to another base-station and re-encrypted.  The cops/feds can listen to the unscrambled call *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider's equipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can listen without having to obtain a warrant.  But, maybe the Clipper system is secure, and they really do need a warrant to get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner (see above - they don't *have* to go down this route anyway).  I have my doubts, but even if true once they have the key they will *never* again need a warrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want.  `Well, Judge, it appears he wasn't a drug-dealer after all, so naturally we'll stop listening in'...

Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,     music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing     complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well     defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far     exceed their technical skills.      The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression     tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and     virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the     observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of     simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar     representions, a confounded user asks: \\\"What does it all mean?\\\"      Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and     ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by     physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media     radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic     communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for     composing imagery for understanding.      Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a     breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the     physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,     psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and     discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the     computer graphics context.

For heaven's (!) sake don't take it literally.      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   So you think it is easy to be a Muslim? Or be a Buddhist? The Buddha's commandments are 500 yrs older than Christ's and in my opinion tougher to follow. Moreover the Buddha says that we are  intrinsically good (as against Christ's \\\"we are all sinners\\\").  Only we allow ourselves to be distracted. By meditating we can awaken  ourselves (etc etc). Also there is no concept of God in Buddhism.  (In my opinion you can be an Atheist and a Buddhist). But to \\\"awaken\\\" yourself is no easy task. Can you stay away from eating meat? Can you sit still and think of nothing (meditate) for sometime everyday? Buddhists do (or are supposed to). Can you pray five times a day?  Can you fast for a month every year (Ramzan). Are you willing to give 1/6 th of your income as tithe? Muslims do. In fact I think  Jesus was an ordinary man (just as Buddha and Mohamed) probably with a  philosopy ahead of the times (where he lived).  Considering the fact that Christianity is a young religion (compared to Hindiusm, Judaism, Zorasterism, Buddihsm) it is also very probable that the Bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideas. (There was a good deal of trade between the eastern lands and the middle east at the time of Christ). And perhaps some more. But leave the crap in it out (\\\"woman was created after man, to be his helper\\\" etc). aras       When ever I turn on my TV there is this Pat Robertson and other brain washers (Oh boy, what an act they put on!) with an 1-800 number to turn in your pledges.

The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because    they are not quoted by the NT authors.  That is not quite accurate.  Otherwise we would have the book of Enoch in the canon (as Dave noted).  One can say that the  apocrypha are not quoted by Christ.     III. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because    they teach doctrines contrary to the (uncontroverted)    parts of the canon.     then I answer:     These is a logically invalid *a priori*.     Besides, we are talking about OT texts-     which in many parts are superceded by the NT    (in the Xtian view). Would not this same    principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_?    This principle cannot be consistently applied.   I have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one voice, and he does not contradict himself.    The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decided that the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books such as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example, the Lutheran hymn \\\"Now Thank We All Our God\\\" quotes a passage from this book.  The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church's history.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the Spirit in so doing.  And that is where this sort of discussion ultimately ends.\",\"I haven't been following the previous HR's.  But there are two, that I saw live that would have to be up there (up where? there!).   1) Rick Monday's HR to bury the Expos in the NL championship in 1981. It was hit off Steve Rogers, who is a RHP and primarily a starter. Why was he used as a reliever when the 'Spos had Reardon and BillLee warming up in the bullpen.  Considering Monday couldn't touch LHP, Lee would have been a safe bet.  He wasn't even doing any drugs at that time (or so he told me and around 50 others on a recent venture into  Montreal.  The blast wasn't the important aspect.  It was the timing. Seventh game, a tie game, and in the top of the 9th.  The Expos almost came back though... 2) Mike Schmidt hit one that killed the Expos in 1980.  So close, yet, so far. and 3) Strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of years ago.  It went off the technical ring in the Big O.  It almost left the stadium!

My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the bottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the 46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have large, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get them :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the waist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece size that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's problems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and when I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).  I can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are in some way different from us real folks.  Also, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands. I've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a store wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom in any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my sidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally leave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall down unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight), stuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit), and run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be running errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...  As far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably equal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by 3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around the waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.  So I'd have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit, I still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I own.  Wouldn't go long distance without it.

If you write a paper which includes sufficiently detailed information on how to build a nuclear weapon, it is classified.  As I understand the law, nuclear weapons design is _automatically_ classified even if you do the work yourself.  I believe you are then not allowed to read your own paper.  A less serious example: if you tell drivers about a speed trap they are about to run into, you can be fined, even though you might argue that you broke no law when you discovered the location of the policeman.  The charge is interfering with a police officer, which is quite similar what you would be doing by reverse engineering the Clipper chip.

GB> I hope you meant \\\"inarguably\\\".  Given the choice, I would rather argue <g>.  No arguments about migranous aura; in fact, current best evidence is that aura is intrinsicially neuronal (a la spreading depression of Leao) rather than vascular (something causing vasoconstriction and secondary neuronal ischemia).  Migraine without aura, however, is a fuzzier issue.  There do not seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The Copenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF studies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura, but like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.  From one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in the absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From another (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of the specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache, therefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.  Whether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling headaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic colleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients they can get.

Archie   provides information about files available for ftp anywhere on the   Internet; Xarchie displays this information using an easy-to-use,   point-and-click interface.  Xarchie allows you to further explore ftp   sites by examining directories returned as query matches, and allows   you to retrieve files located this way.  Xarchie 2.0 has been extensively tested on R4, R5, and a variety of other flavors of X, and on a wide range of machines. A summary of the new features (from the README) follows:    * Major improvements include:     - Multiple selections allowed in browser for use with other new       features (FWF MultiList widget).     - Ability to expand directories in browser.     - Real fully-integrated ftp implementation.     - Ability to save and reload query results, as well as print them.     - Ability to resort results, and sort results by user-definable       pseudo-weights.     - Online help browser.     - Color resources, done so that they don't break mono displays.     - FWF FileSelector widget for local file operations.     - Makefile.dst's supplied for the imake-impaired.

Someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast  to ban the ozone-depleting (CFC) chemicals and not gasolines and other  greenhouse-gas-producing compounds.  The greenhouse effect (produced by  infrared-trapping gasses like CO2 and methane) and the ozone-hole problem  (produced by long-lived, chlorine-containing molecules) are not the same  thing.  It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's  (chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which  are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms.  Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help  the greenhouse-gas problem, but would do nothing for the ozone problem.   Fred W.

(Sorry all HP fans, but I have a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their (excellent) gear).  One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is whether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock the instrument into real time capture mode.   I agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are _beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus. However, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students) seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or more knobs required of a \\\"real\\\" scope :-)   This is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at least they appear to be logically laid out.  One more thing about the new, \\\"simpler\\\", front panels. These instruments tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the longevity of the instruments.

Recently, I had a baby boy born with seizures which occured 12-15 hours after birth. He was immediately transferred to a major hospital in Boston and has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition. This has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in learning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with hospitals, procedures...etc.  I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but his condition was termed  quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight as a normal baby would. He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugs and that did not seem to help out. His MRI, EKG, cat-scans are all normal, but the EEG's show alot of seizure activity. After many metabolic tests, body structure tests, and infection/virus tests the doctors still do not know quite what type of siezures he is having (although they do have alot of evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms ).

Whilst I have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some relevant books are listed in a companion article.  To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.  Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism.  So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine being.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it may not.  \\\"What is atheism?\\\"  Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is often referred to as the \\\"weak atheist\\\" position, and the latter as \\\"strong atheism\\\".  It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \\\"Weak atheism\\\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \\\"Strong atheism\\\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \\\"strong atheists\\\".  Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making flat-out denials.  \\\"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?\\\"  Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not.  Which brings us to agnosticism.  \\\"What is agnosticism then?\\\"  The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed (\\\"strong\\\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable.  Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether God exists.  Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people use agnosticism to mean \\\"weak atheism\\\", and use the word \\\"atheism\\\" only when referring to \\\"strong atheism\\\".  Beware also that because the word \\\"atheist\\\" has so many shades of meaning, it is very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for sure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe.  \\\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\\\"  There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.  Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that such a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they see no evidence that God exists.  \\\"But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\\\"  There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects obeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly well-defined is a matter for debate.  However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of God.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.  If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest primes, because we can prove that they don't exist.  Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of the time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.  To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be tested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to prove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by default that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.  Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God exists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be possible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious book does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described by any present-day religion exists.  In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of God are not really applicable.  \\\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\\\"  If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction must be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable.  If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue that if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no importance whether he exists or not.  If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites. Surely he should still be detectable today?  Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically verifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him from all the other things that don't exist?  \\\"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but  isn't it still a religious belief?\\\"  One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \\\"the redefinition game\\\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:  Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out that it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He then records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to it, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \\\"agreed fact\\\", but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.  The point of this digression is that the answer to the question \\\"Isn't atheism a religious belief?\\\" depends crucially upon what is meant by \\\"religious\\\".  \\\"Religion\\\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and worship.  [ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not   \\\"religion\\\" according to such a definition. ]  Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of \\\"religious\\\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \\\"religious\\\" as well -- such as science, politics, and watching TV.  \\\"OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is  still just an act of faith, like religion is?\\\"  Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in.  Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt.  Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are the sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called \\\"acts of faith\\\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.  Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something. According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is \\\"certain\\\".  This is not a general tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists.  Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof. Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism has no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or the lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.  \\\"If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?\\\"  It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \\\"for\\\" or \\\"against\\\", \\\"friend\\\" or \\\"enemy\\\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.  Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense, it can be said to be \\\"anti-religion\\\".  However, when religious believers speak of atheists being \\\"anti-religious\\\" they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.  This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair. Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.  Most atheists take a \\\"live and let live\\\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they will not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of course, this may be in part because atheism is not \\\"socially acceptable\\\" in many countries.  A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \\\"convert\\\" others when possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.  (To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished.  The institution of \\\"state atheism\\\" came about when Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population.)  Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example, the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate.  \\\"But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,  surely that's the same as state atheism?\\\"  The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of another, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in nature.  Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For example, religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters, and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say.  \\\"What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people  pray?\\\"  Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things that those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in schools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they need not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event.  Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other motives.  \\\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about  atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't  atheists object to the religious charities?\\\"  There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for the sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis.  Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in connection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday matter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say self-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs.  To \\\"weak\\\" atheists, building a hospital to say \\\"I do not believe in God\\\" is a rather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say \\\"Today is not my birthday\\\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.  \\\"You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against  one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?\\\"  Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists.  It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the other hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others.  On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently.  \\\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\\\"  They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.  Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a Verdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts, they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy of the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!  Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance.  \\\"Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?\\\"  That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course atheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when one talks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\\\"right\\\") and unacceptable (\\\"wrong\\\") behaviour within society.  Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must co-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from \\\"anti-social\\\" or \\\"immoral\\\" behaviour, purely for the purposes of self-preservation.  Many atheists behave in a \\\"moral\\\" or \\\"compassionate\\\" way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care what happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.  Naturally, there are some people who behave \\\"immorally\\\" and try to use atheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who behave \\\"immorally\\\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions.  For example:    \\\"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ    came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was    shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited    patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive    eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,    be honor and glory forever and ever.\\\"  The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a religious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?     A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior    deteriorated after \\\"born again\\\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents    said they had driven intoxicated before being \\\"born again,\\\" 12% had done    so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before    conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex    before salvation; 5% after.                                 [\\\"Freethought Today\\\", September 1991, p. 12.]  So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour.  \\\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\\\"  If you mean \\\"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\\\", then the answer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people.  If you mean \\\"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\\\", then the answer is no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \\\"moral rules\\\" as theists, but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by humans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.  \\\"Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?\\\"  A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them.  Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are unbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.  This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that individual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only choice that person can honestly make.  \\\"But don't atheists want to believe in God?\\\"  Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many of them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the \\\"Big Brother\\\" figure might be.  Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of such an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.  \\\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are  unwilling in their souls to see!\\\"  Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained above, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God exists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.  Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded. Comments such as \\\"Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly\\\" are likely to be viewed as patronizing.  Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is futile.  \\\"Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\\\"  Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives meaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives count, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other people who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.  It is a natural human tendency to look for \\\"meaning\\\" or \\\"purpose\\\" in random events.  However, it is by no means obvious that \\\"life\\\" is the sort of thing that has a \\\"meaning\\\".  To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \\\"What is the meaning of life?\\\" is as silly as asking \\\"What is the meaning of a cup of coffee?\\\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.  \\\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\\\"  There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets. Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.  That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so what?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?  In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just hard luck.  \\\"Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\\\"  The short answer is \\\"No, do you?\\\"  Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.  Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of the existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.  \\\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments  apply?\\\"  No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is the sceptical \\\"default position\\\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism is a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.  Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers, but to everyone else.  \\\"What sort of harm?\\\"  Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings; think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on. Imagine how that effort could be better spent.  Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances of ill people being \\\"healed\\\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.  It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- and condoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many third-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.  Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion.  \\\"Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some  sort of excuse.\\\"  What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hard to tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all convinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight and kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REAL Christian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like the Catholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?  In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who calls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his actions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians are just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if the Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't be much of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he have made it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs aren't a perversion of what your God intended?  If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so? Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a Christian.  \\\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since  nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely  that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\\\"  That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue, positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns don't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.  It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \\\"weak\\\" atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still.  \\\"Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?\\\"  Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \\\"correct\\\" it is, or whether it \\\"works\\\"; consider how many people believe in astrology, graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.  Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.  Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world, we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other purposes as well.  \\\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say  something?\\\"  Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's worth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of concept of God in the Christian sense.  Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.  \\\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded  that God exists?\\\"  For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who does not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders.  A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.  \\\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates  nothing?\\\"  Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far.  The theory of memetics talks of \\\"memes\\\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure to keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes.  Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it.  \\\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important  messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\\\"  There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a few of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions.     There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.     Be especially sceptical of positive claims.     If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to    find it.     Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.     Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.     It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change    yourself.     Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.     If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.     Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.  and finally (and most importantly):     All beliefs should be open to question.

By its subject i would assume you are directing the argument towards people who do not believe that Christ rose from the dead, but in your \\\"proof,\\\" you use the bible exclusively.  The post is therefore immediately useless to anyone who doesn't believe that the bible is an unadulterated truth, and to everyone else, it is just a reaffirmation of a belief already held.

About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes  under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement  of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of  the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced  the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor   suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.   While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being   manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently  increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (  palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part  the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had  been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the  pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is   persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3  and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides  minor reductions in pain and is only short term.     My questions are:        Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the      levels of pain?       Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?       Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?     Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.         Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.

But if you look at Collosions, without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be  a ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.  against us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what what food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days, or the keeping of the sabbath.  The word for sabbath in this verse is \\\"sabbaton\\\" and is used throughout the New Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.  If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption \\\"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law\\\" then he will have to find some way around it, like saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the 7tH day, Because \\\"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.\\\"  But Paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal  statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin in his writings.  Also, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which talks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would have been a big problem for first century Christians living in a society that did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst were slaves.  It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath if it had been mandatory.  Why is there no mention of this in the epistles?\",\" \\\"Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom.

In retrospect I would also like to quote another source: Douglas C. Haldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_  THERAPY INEFFECTIVE  Recently the founders of yet another prominent \\\"ex-gay\\\" ministry, Exodus International, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective. Michael Busse and Gary Cooper, cofounders of Exodus International and lovers for 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  The program was described by these men as \\\"ineffective . . . not one person was healed.\\\"  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed \\\"reparative therapy.\\\"  The previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June 30, 1992 called \\\"The Ex-Ex-Gay\\\" by Robert Pela.  Some personal thoughts:  It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major portion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among its ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all they required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even later, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and segragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings. Today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is still coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind control, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than God sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt thier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is \\\"physically\\\" forced to stay in this \\\"reparative therapy\\\" but sheer social pressure is enough for many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.  As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution against gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by the contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live, not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t a clue what is in their heart.

SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it. There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and the software.  THAT IS IT. Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.  SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}  asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}  synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a  rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}  SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from  SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs  this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers  AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the   slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode   4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous  mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}  SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things  over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the  machine and the external device.  Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver  software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.  Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.  SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this  requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING  devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.

We are now mapping the human genome.  We will  ;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic ;engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want. ;No breeding, no \\\"hybrids\\\", etc.  The ethical question is, should ;we?   Two past problems with eugenics have been  1) reducing the gene pool and  2) defining the status of the eugenized.   Inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted genes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to crowd out \\\"garbage genes.\\\" This may in the future become possible. Even if it does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully mean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy later. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa and for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We don't really know what the future may hold for our environment. The reduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred domesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age, meteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc., etc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible available is a good strategy for species survival.    Of course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out as no different than anyone else's. But if we could make \\\"philosopher-kings\\\" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they) want to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their kings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually realized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while, it was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen to persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing new under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before \\\"1984.\\\"      I see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2 problems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to use any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That hasn't stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which have died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also many are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own power. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the fates of others, and have survived by making better choices when their turns came.   Not that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us off the face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global warming or whatever could and may still do that, too.    The real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don't think man has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any better than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we may not. If we don't, I hope there are reservoirs of \\\"garbage\\\" people out in some backwater with otherwise long discarded \\\"garbage\\\" genes which will pull us through.    I believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same. Man needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his lacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have, and I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God in their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue needed to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have died out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough input from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed themselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the ones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit to use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes thus far, or else haven't had enough power for long enough.    In summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new technology is really an ancient one. And the answer, in some ways hard, in some ways easy, is the same ancient answer. It isn't the power, it is the Spirit.   Sorry for the long post. Got carried away.\",\" I live in Colorado, and have never heard of such a group.

The scenario you outline is reasonably  consistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does not support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by latest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for about 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at most) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before there were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease... mostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just fossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what brought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then how could it exist before humans?  [deletions]   Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about biology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There is no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off' in perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a collective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the degeneration of the genetic code'.    Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But it still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as much damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even when people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed', (forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and died off for lack of nearby hosts.  I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few hundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to be getting less nasty w/age...    Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right? And, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It seems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift humans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less lethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems, imperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us by God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made our immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases?    Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the phrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect' system would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system that will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a perfect system. At least, IMHO.  Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the original genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart? If so, why could God not have used better materials?  Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself, of did It just choose not to?  [deletions]   My main point, as I said, was that there really isn't any evidence for the explanation you give. (At least, that I'm aware of.)

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS      Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints     have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on     microfilm.      The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it     is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like     guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB     have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch     from.      By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify     the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean     sheet design.       WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE      Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access     for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an     opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being     \\\"scooped\\\" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently     releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early     in a mission.       RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES      There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to     block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium     thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in     worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental     reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.     Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2     RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather     satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months     with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar     module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which     was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in     the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10     half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].

IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER      From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from     the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible     for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted     study, Charles Jackman.      The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was     organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space     Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia     (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space     Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and     Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects     of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.      The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:         Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year    Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year    Shuttle sources:   725,000 kilograms/year      The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are     launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the     total stratospheric chlorine sources.      The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would     be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.      The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and     Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch     schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons     do at the present time.      Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space     Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR     Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W. Ko and N.D.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE      If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a     minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your     breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to     watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your     Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal     experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no     immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do     not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.      Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \\\"the bends\\\", certainly some     [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from     lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,     you're dying. The limits are not really known.

Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School     of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.       HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED      The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is     a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.     What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank     came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the     astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin     team's medical/forensic report.      The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the     water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks     underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team     examined them, they were sent off to be buried.       USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT      You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit     because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry     enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.      Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of     that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in     the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly     specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it     higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit     spacecraft.      [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]       THE \\\"FACE ON MARS\\\"      There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid     face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:     35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often     published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13     (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).      Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is     artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an     extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the     resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a     smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere     on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't     know the address) to study the Face.      The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution     camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this     question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is     best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or     sci.astro.      V. DiPeitro and G.

There are no clutch hitters.

I hadn't bought a new car since I bought my Honda 4WD back in '85, and I was unbelieveably offended by most salespeople I met.  Saturn was indeed very different. I made three different visits to the dealer where I bought my car, and was never pressured. Saturn also had the best after-sales support, and the fixed pricing made it *very* easy for me to decide exactly what I wanted to buy. Another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the dealer. He's been fixing imports for 20 years...and bought a Saturn, based on what he's seen and heard from his customers.   Saturn also has a good extended warranty program; $675 for 6 year/60K miles,  fully refunded if you don't use it. That works out to an actual cost of $170 or so, based on the 6 year treasury rates. Using savings account rates it's more like $120. In the first three years it also buys you free rental during any warranty work, without counting against the refund.\",\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Final Solution for Gaza ?   Final Solution for the Gaza ghetto ? ------------------------------------  While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto, they repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and attempt to starve the Gazans.  The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world, has been cut off from the world for weeks. The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the strip and seek work in Israel.  While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help the Gazan resistance. The only help given to Gazans by Israeli Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.  The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of justice. A population denied basic human rights is entitled to rise up against its tormentors.  As is known, the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel, although they are considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels, shops and fields. Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in Israel. They may not live there, for these areas are reserved for the Master Race.  The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the right to self- administration.  They selected Jews to pacify the occupied population and preventing any form of resistance. Some Jewish collaborators were killed. Israel also wishes to rule over Gaza through Arab collaborators.  As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible with basic human rights and international law, that of becoming Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for self-determination, it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish society does not consider Gazans full human beings. This attitude is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews. The current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister Yitzhak Rabin that 'Gaza sink into the sea'. One is led to ask oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister goals towards the Gazans ? Whether they have some Final Solution up their sleeve ?  I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever they can to help the Gazans regain their full human, civil and political rights, to which they are entitled as human beings.

Most of the other models are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of. I threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese technology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn't include domestic small cars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I think Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese roots.  The SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:  Toyota Paseo Honda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si Nissan NX1600/NX2000 Mazda MX-3 Isuzu Impulse Geo Storm Ford Escort GT   If you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're 4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and trend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan platforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher prices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:  Tercel -> Paseo Sentra -> NX1600/NX2000 Civic -> del Sol 323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one) Stylus -> Impulse/Storm  To illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at around $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now, you might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doors offer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable powerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let's take another example: the Isuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a 1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive. Again, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more fashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more money for this type of car.     In short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence \\\"less\\\" car, it's market orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent sedan (SL1/SL2) version.  I hope this clears things up a bit...... \",\"By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff  At 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer. Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of 17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff-bound Blues.  The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3. With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit playing.  They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired.  ``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,\\\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.  If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues' disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry's anger.  ``It wasn't pretty at the end,\\\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but it did.\\\"  Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end. Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium.  The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points, their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay, which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.  The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.  ``It's a shame we let down,\\\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others. ``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\\\"  Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. ``We won, and that's all that matters,\\\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3 for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\\\"  Some players didn't have a problem.  ``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,\\\" said Rich Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.  ``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\\\"  Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow, he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.  ``I didn't know it was final,\\\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs, and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end.\\\"  The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.  ``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,\\\" Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.\\\"  If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.  Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then, Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.  With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.  Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.  Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the  rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend.  Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.  ``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\\\" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and I know he was watching. I know he's happy.\\\"  Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo at 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds later, making it 5-1.  Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.  Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third period.  The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the winner. ``We were in there,\\\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\\\"\",\"  If you need just to change the wallpaper, then I've written a short program in VB that does this by using SystemParametersInfo-function.

My observations over the past 30 years (and not withstanding a little history reading beside) is that while religious differences do play a part in many of the conflicts, so does (unfortunately) race, economics and any other items that identify one group of men as being different from another.  If we want to couch the cause of conflict in Christian terms, I would put it while Christ died for our sins, we are yet sinners. While some individuals assume \\\"Christlike\\\" natures, most of us do not even come close.

But Turks did not do so.  They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody \\\"to worship in their own way\\\" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus, in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when  people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and  where accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey was the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian countries.\\\"[1]  \\\"The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came under their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It was a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of Russian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a Romanian nation today\\\" (Popescu Ciocanel).  \\\"Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without interfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy of minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most advanced European countries.\\\"[2]  \\\"...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw is older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples of this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account of his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of simple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into action, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves happy!\\\" (A. de Mortraye).[3]  \\\"Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and Portugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years, and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to appear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today.

While the dead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional candles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in the Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical processions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing their crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them which forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of  priests.\\\" (A.

Serdar Argic\",\" Every city and suburban police officer I've seen around the Twin Cities in the last two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though I haven't seen any Glock's).   With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two cents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a  large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand him and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something  like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that \\\"different is good\\\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in  more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a certain \\\"propriatory nature\\\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to  learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.   Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.    I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time.    Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off.   The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always  take more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can still be used if needed later).     Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).     All common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should say that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining the design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and  shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.   Yeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver for safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.   I think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it's a small one B^)).   I have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to r.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is a shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.    9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still lead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto's seem the rule for the street cop.  Don't know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry the \\\"Highway Patrolman\\\".

If they would of had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened.  The BATF needs more people, better weapons and more armored transports. When they meet hostile fire they should be able to use more force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going to do a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they must have the proper equipment and people to do the job.  With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed more now then ever. If they blast away a few good fokes then that is the price we all have to pay for law and order in this country.

Just about ANYBODY with basic manufacturing skill can turn out HIGH QUALITY submachineguns.  A  couple of high school shop teachers were recently arrested for building  submachineguns in the school shop.

You are merely expressing \\\"approval\\\" of the consequences I find therein. Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my (or any) religion.  \\\"Love\\\" is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christians can write both the \\\"gentle\\\" words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in a passage that even the \\\"conservatives\\\" will quote at you :-) -- and the words of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, \\\"Love is the unfamiliar Name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...\\\"  This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise in my note, as will become more evident below.   blechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though, given my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of \\\"sin\\\" on another, and my unshakeable \\\"disestablishmentarianism\\\", Russel Turpin and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my legislating my own understanding of Christian love.   You misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \\\"God\\\" in near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:  The \\\"possibility that always exists\\\" is that I (or, to revert to proper time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could persuade \\\"Christian B\\\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian argumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian] prohibitions.  What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:   A.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved      in the Inquisition.   B.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however      painful this *seems*, \\\"discipline\\\" her children for their      own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or      if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example      \\\"deterring\\\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)   A.  I point out that this \\\"justification\\\" of a failure in love      depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of      philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.   B.  Burns me at the stake.  My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is going on here has a *lot* to do with \\\"cultural baggage.\\\"  In this case, the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between A and B.  Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B, then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what- ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense attorney.  So, \\\"one possibility\\\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in may others.  At the other extreme, the \\\"persuasion\\\" will succeed when it properly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the Inquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that many of the victims of Inquisition will have \\\"accepted\\\" that they were in fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them.)  The point is that the \\\"persuasion\\\" breaks down when the parties do NOT share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main thrust of the Inquisition, against \\\"heresy\\\", it is *bound* to break down in precisely the \\\"worst\\\" cases.  The \\\"conservative\\\" (I don't think that is the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above, that he is \\\"justified\\\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to a \\\"greater good.\\\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow the gospel, as if one's theories about \\\"sin\\\" entitled one to cast aside Jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).  I am a \\\"radical\\\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.   Well, the whole *point* of making these the \\\"base\\\" commandments is that they *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great Commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A demand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important that I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \\\"Conservatives\\\" may twist this \\\"act as if you were God\\\" to mean \\\"lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules.\\\" They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy IS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \\\"against God\\\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \\\"conservatives\\\" have confused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard American atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.   And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged *different* \\\"ethical systems\\\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result, it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular (or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH. It does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very little, if anything, in the way of \\\"commandments\\\" -- so little that the \\\"Christians\\\" who desperately *want* commandments go \\\"mining\\\" for them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-)) for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus specifically \\\"gives\\\" as \\\"a commandment\\\" to us is \\\"love one another.\\\"   [I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson   that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that   SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll   point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why   there is a huge amount of \\\"cultural baggage\\\" involved.]  You are quite right that this is \\\"goo\\\" if one is looking for an ethical system.  But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.   I think you are begging the question. Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity? [Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]\",\"Forwarded from John Spencer (spencer@lowell.edu):  There will be two eclipses of Iapetus by Saturn and its rings, in May and July.  Please spread the word!  Here's some information about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have some money available...  John Spencer, 1993/04/21  Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn itself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21, (21:16-09:38 UT).  Timing is as follows;       1993 May 1-2          A-ring ingress  18:27                egress   19:30         B-ring ingress  19:51                egress   21:42         C-ring egress   23:00         Saturn ingress  23:59                egress   10:02         B-ring ingress  10:28                egress   12:19         A-ring ingress  12:40                egress   13:43       1993 July 20-21          Saturn ingress  21:16                egress   05:08         A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing)                egress   09:38  Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris, and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus' orbit.  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from Iapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about the rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy and Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my attention.  THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?     To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July   disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,   etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,   except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3   airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with   a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something   to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.    Jay  and again:    please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet   disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would   be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and   getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a   good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't   think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are   well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One   possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.  jay\",\"Enclosed are the rules, guidelines and related information for the 10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest.

X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X  X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that mearly works X    correctly is not sufficient.

Best  strategy, given that you don't mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E. Taylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45, when the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell and will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.       Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on;  what's left at 7:45 may be nosebleed material (D, E sections).

This is the same anti-gun police chief that wanted full-auto Uzis for his patrol cars...).  Perhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago's finest, a close-to- 100% reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99% reliable automatic. I note that in Germany, where certainly the 9mm semi-auto handgun is king, some of the more elite police types want revolvers.  I don't think the issue is cost, because Chicago police certainly make on the order of at least $40K/year.   Your presumption of \\\"disadvantage\\\" I think is not borne out by the experiences of New York City's cops; there the cops usually come out on top with their standard .38 Spl revolvers.  I've seen S&Ws, Rugers and Beretta 9mms in addition to the revolvers carried by Chicago cops.... in the past, I've seen .45 M1911s; others have seen Browning Hi-Powers...\",\"henrik]  Country. Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the henrik]  KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan.   BM] Gimme a break.  CAPITAL letters, or NOT, the above is pure nonsense.  It BM] seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      Again, Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending themselves. What do      want them to do. Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them.  BM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment, BM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it BM] is a part of it.    Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged  training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.   henrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000  henrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the  henrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending  henrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION.   BM]  Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them BM]  within their borders?     Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into          the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.  henrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the  henrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER  henrik] OCCUR again.  BM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?     It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped    into Armenia if SHE could.   BM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header BM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?     Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many         cases, HISTORY repeats itself.   BM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes  BM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring BM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians  BM] are attacking Azeri towns.   So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey         wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!   I will believe it when I see it.   Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing         to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean  BURNING people ALIVE !  BM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  BM] futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  BM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  BM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.     Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are          NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN.   BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent  BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe  BM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better  BM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?   Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the  conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in  KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.  BM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes BM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of  BM] their blood and future.    Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension         to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH         are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.  BM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  BM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians BM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate  BM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in BM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for BM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading BM] inflammatory half-truths.\",\"Hi.

Most atheists are perfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of Jesus--but are quite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into  misunderstandings, hoaxes, or simple fabrications.

If you want less quality, cut that to 4000 bps (half rate).  At full rate variable you could put two full-duplex conversations on a V.32bis modem.  This requires a DSP or ASICs, though.  An RS-6000 has a CPU that could probably do it in real-time, because it has the add-and-multiply instruction and a few other DSP things.  If you want to do speech in real-time you need about 4000 samples a second (for not very good voice) with your 8 bit samples (ISDN is 8000 8-bit samples a second), which is 32 kbps.  You could do a fast 2:1 compression on that to get it down to 16 kbps, which is just about V.32bis.  The quality at this point is very bleah, but it should work. Now add in the time for your encryption method.  You're going to need sampling hardware, which is no problem on a new Mac, an Amiga.  Or a PC with a SoundBlaster card (just because they're so popular and cheap - you could also build a simple ADC).  The problem with the SoundBlaster is that it doesn't seem to be full duplex - you can't sample and play backq at the same time, making a two-way conversation a bit tough.  The special hardware or a more capable sound card may be required.  The only thing that worries me is that 2:1 compression - the SoundBlaster can do it automatically in hardware, but other than that I don't have a good feel for how processor intensive it is, so I can't estimate how fast a PC you'd need.  \",\" Paul,  Unfortunately, there are not too many retail outlets that'll stock just about every chip made.  The stuff they will stock are the ones that'll sell, like standard DRAM's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc. i.e.  I cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.  The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or the Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flip through them.  Distributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics, etc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves where we only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy by the hundreds or more.  Each distributor represents and sells a variety of different non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this? Suppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386's.  It's a pretty good bet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 386's, or vice-versa. They also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturer they represent.  Who knows?  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them. But I'd be suprised if you do.  ALso bear in mind that the 1 or 2 qty prices they will charge you will be *much* greater than what a mail order outlet will charge.  My advice?  If you're gonna be designing anything, try to stick with off-the-shelf stuff.  You're going to get stuck if you use too many esoteric parts sooner or later.  good luck,\",\"Has anyone else experienced problems with windows hanging after the installation of DOS 6?

So that the non-muslim readers of this group will see how far from  the simple basics of Islam such views are on the face of them. And  if they are _not_ in contradiction with the basics of Islam, how  subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in Islam while  they are explicitly proscribed by the Qur'an.     In my opinion considering any human being as having a substance or metaphysical fundamentally different from that of any other human being _is_ a heretical notion and one proscribed by Islam.

See his book, \\\"Discovering\\\".  Ring structures for benzene had been proposed before Kekule', after him, and at the same time as him. The current models do not resemble Kekule's.  Many of the predecessors of Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more.  I don't think \\\"extra-scientific\\\" is a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational is a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.  For example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of enantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a friend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but Pasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking at the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he lacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic acid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.  Again, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers (tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks contained fantasies of becoming the \\\"Newton of mirror-image life,\\\" which he never admitted publically.  Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery started this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile and Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice. Most of Griffiths' critics were French, which decided the issue for the student.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro, which the student eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the research program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery (Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\",\"  If this is God's attitude, then I'll think I'll go along with Terry Pratchett's religious philosophy:  \\\"Oh, I believe in God.

This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line looks better on low resolution devices.  The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent.  They also give an example of how to \\\"emulate\\\" strokeadjust in PostScript environments where it is absent.  The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints of a line using the following formula for each coordinate:   new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25   Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in \\\".25\\\".  From reading I thought that what they might actually do is:   new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25   This results in all the coordinates ending in either \\\"0.25\\\" or \\\"0.75\\\"  whichever is closer.  By doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find that neither of these is what DPS really uses.

Also there is a nontechnical book on solar sailing by Louis Friedman, a technical one by a guy whose name escapes me (help me out, Josh), and I would expect that Greg Matloff and Eugene Mallove have something to say about the subject in *The Starflight Handbook*, as well as quite a few references.

People might quibble about what \\\"intrinsically\\\" means but the reason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we are. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good, but great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a  different technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we do not realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking  on water until a little doubt crept in.  Doesn't David ask in the 8th Psalm \\\"what is man that you [God]  should care for him, but you have made him just a little lower  than the angels\\\"?  I probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid David was, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliath was, but David's power easily defeated Goliath's.  Remember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks what he can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments. I always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done that his whole life, probably anticipating an \\\"attaboy\\\" from the  Messiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything and follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples say how can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people. Jesus says anyone can do it, with God's help.  Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid getting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committing adultery, we can control our own desires.   I realize this was not your main point, but I wonder how other people see this.    (Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make.)  Your point about how \\\"hard\\\" other religions are is a good one, just  as your \\\"Parting Question\\\" is a tough question. I think that Muslims worship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name \\\"submission\\\". Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that \\\"God\\\" is impersonal.  Is God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a little more my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater  to be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but you're right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think more I must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond my conception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu's conception. If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmology then maybe I wouldn't have a problem, though that is hard to imagine.

Some take it to the extreme and say that their religion is the ONLY one and if you don't accept their teachings then you won't be \\\"saved\\\". It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim to know what God thinks/wants. Especially when it's based upon your interpretation of a book. The logic in the above statement is faulty in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can't both be correct. It's all about perception. No two people are exactly alike. No two people perceive everything in the same way. I believe that there is one truth. Call it God's truth, a universal truth, or call it what you will. I don't believe God presents this truth. I think it is just there and it's up to you to look for and see it, through prayer, meditation, inspir- ation, dreams or whatever. Just because people may perceive this truth differently, it doesn't mean one is wrong and the other is right. As an example, take the question, \\\"Is the glass half empty or half full\\\"?

Thanks!\",\"I've recently listened to a tape by Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski, in which he  claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti- cancer properties that he names antineoplastons.  Burzynski says that his  work has met with hostility in the United States, despite the favorable  responses of his subjects during clinical trials.  What is the generally accepted opinion of Dr. Burzynski's research?  He  paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an  intolerant medical establishment, but I have no basis from which to judge  his claims.  Two weeks ago, however, I read that the NIH's Department of  Alternative Medicine has decided to focus their attention on Burzynski's  work.  Their budget is so small that I imagine they wouldn't investigate a  treatment that didn't seem promising.  Any opinions on Burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current  status of his research would be appreciated. \",\"        As to how many clients may be display on a server, I believe the limit would be how much memory is available to your server or allocated by the server.  \",\"     From what I read, the other fellow told Salameh how to put it together over the phone.  The bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type, so to put a (I assume complicated) sophisticated bomb together from instructions _over the phone_ (!) one must need some brains I would expect.    I read this in an article in \\\"The Australian Muslim Times\\\", the newspaper (weekly) of the Australian Muslim community.    If this is true, perhaps one of the Muslims based in North America (if they see this posting) can elaborate.       I don't deny this fact.  The thrust of my argument here is that   (a) Salameh is, according to US law, innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law.  As his guilt has not been established, it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.  (b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps have not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important  distinction.  I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say \\\"Muslim\\\".  In general, anyone who calls themselves a \\\"Muslim\\\" and does not do or  outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam is considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to Islam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a Muslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential principles, though, then one does leave Islam.  The term \\\"Muslim\\\" is to be contrasted with \\\"Mu'min\\\", which means \\\"true believer\\\".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is something known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you will not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism, because it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I, for example, am a \\\"true believer\\\" or not.  For example, I could just be putting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to what I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say \\\"Muslims\\\" we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in practice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By \\\"Muslim\\\" we do not necessarily mean \\\"Mu'min\\\", or \\\"true believer\\\" in Islam.\",\"    > :Thousands?  Tens of thousands?  Do some arithmetic, please...  Skipjack    > :has 2^80 possible keys.    >     > We don't yet know if all 80 bits count.     That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something    they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be    verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the    chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the    output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output    bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.     If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that    some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that    they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,    DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output    change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think    NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.  Consider a cryptosytem that starts out by XORing bits 23 and 47, and not using either of these bits except through this XOR. This system makes early use of every bit. but an exhaustive key search would now only have 2^79 keys to search. Your test by varying single key bits wouldn't turn up anything interesting.     Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see    the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased    subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The algorithm I suggest above would stick out like a sore thumb, but I'm sure I could design a system with a more subtle key redundancy which was well-hidden, but would still make an exhaustive key search take far less than 2^80 encryptions. I don't believe your claim that the real keysize can be verified externally.\",\"   Here's a simple way to convert the Clipper proposal to an unexceptionable    one: Make it voluntary.     That is--you get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree    to escrow your key. Otherwise you are on your own.  That's the disturbing part - use of other products IS voluntary, for now, and the press releases talk about the White House's unwillingness to decide that citizens have a right to good commercial crypto gear, and about how commercial alternatives will be permitted as long as they provide key escrow services.  That's a clear implication that they're considering banning alternatives.  Additionally, use of real alternatives ISN'T totally legal - you're not allowed to export really good crypto equipment except to the government's friends (e.g. the Australian government) you can only export even BAD crypto equipment with their permission, and the regulators who control the cellular telephone companies make sure there are only two competitors, so Joe's Garage Cellular can't start offering a secure service.  \",\"I am posting this message for a friend of mine who does not have a computer account, if you have any questions please call Dan at (814)238-1804.\",\" Ah...

Wait a minute. S&K did NOT compare trends.  If they did, they would have seen that the advent of Canada's gun law had no effect on homicides, total or handgun.  Without a pre- vs. post comparison, one cannot speculate as to the utility of anything.  All they have is a correlation, and correlation DOES NOT prove causality.    Hold it again. You dismiss a point about demographics, then you ask about socio-economic demographics? Very slick.  Once again, correlation does not prove causality.  Looking at pre-vs. post data, the Canadian gun law had no effect.   Sir, if you were a Canadian, and owned a gun before the restrictive gun laws were passed, and decided to hide it rather than turn it in, would you answer truthfully a question about gun ownership from someone who calls, writes, or asks you on the street?  That is one problem with surveys.  Nobody will answer an incriminating question. Another is that people will often tell you what they THINK you want to here.   Does that mean no Vancouver citizens have handguns? I think not. You are discounting guns purchased beforehand, and guns purchased for purposes other than self-defense, which can also be used for defense.   He makes valid points about demographic differences.  You then resort to the kind of argument that the \\\"Politically Correct\\\" movement often uses to stifle any debate.  Nice, real nice.    One doesn't have to produce his own data in order to point out the flaws in the methodology and conclusions of another's study. Again, you resort to PC tactics. \",\"    How many of you readers know anything about Jews living in the Arab countries?  How many of you know if Jews still live in these countries?

 Heavy for a beginner bike it is; 415 pounds it isn't, except maybe in some adman's dream.  With a full tank, it's in the area of 550 lbs, depending on year etc.   The 1980 and '81 versions had a much better seat, IMO.   My regulator lasted over 100,000 miles, and didn't overcharge the battery. The wiring connectors in the charging path did get toasty though, tending to melt their insulation.  I suspect they were underspecified; it didn't help that they were well removed from cool air.  Battery access on the earlier bikes doesn't require tank removal. After you learn the drill, it's pretty straightforward.  [...]  Having bought replacement parts for several brands of motorcycles, I'll offer a grain of salt to be taken with Dale's assessment.  [...]\",\" The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and  exploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians  in any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently.  The idea that \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi citizens died is ludicrous.  Not even \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi soldiers died, and they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians? Either the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did), or they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to destroying Iraq's military potential.  The military mission planners are not fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war. Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you, not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrant-dictator.   How about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2? I don't hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but with smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are misidentified; innocents die.  That's war the way it really is. But the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like it's one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is worse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, \\\"I know not what course others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!\\\"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wishes to stay free.      Mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here. You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I feel sure that was not your intent.  So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I'm sure that appeasement would have worked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we shouldn't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor  French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We  should have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you'd be speaking German instead of English right now.  Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don't understand diplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is that Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad, so now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice (not to mention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait  was a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would've been better!  And as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why* the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of \\\"not guilty\\\"? Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape. But the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I have not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen.    Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused, whether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one's guilt, and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism.

Consider two vertices, p and q, which are connected by at least one edge.  If (p,q) is an edge, then (q,p) should *not* appear.    If *both* (p,q) and (q,p) appear as edges, then the surface \\\"flips\\\" when you travel across that edge.  This is bad.    Assuming (warning...warning...warning) that you have an otherwise acceptable surface - you can pick an edge, any edge, and traverse the surface enforcing consistency with that edge.        0) pick an edge (p,q), and mark it as \\\"OK\\\"     1) for each face, F, containing this edge (if more than 2, oops)        make sure that all edges in F are consistent (i.e., the Face        should be [(p,q),(q,r),(r,s),(s,t),(t,p)]).  Flip those which        are wrong. Mark all of the edges in F as \\\"OK\\\",        and add them to a queue (check for duplicates, and especially        inconsistencies - don't let the queue have both (p,q) and (q,p)).      2) remove an edge from the queue, and go to 1).  If a *marked* edge is discovered to be inconsistent, then you lose.  If step 1) finds more than one face sharing a particular edge, then you lose.       Otherwise, when done, all of the edges will be consistent.  Which means that all of the surface normals will either point IN or OUT.  Deciding which way is OUT is left as an exercise...   \",\"..continuing on my build problems, I got stuck here build xterm...  gcc -fpcc-struct-return -o xterm main.o input.o charproc.o cursor.o util.o tabs.o  screen.o scrollbar.o button.o Tekproc.o misc.o  VTPrsTbl.o TekPrsTbl.o data.o menu.o -O2   -R/usr/wgep/X11R5.sos5/lib${LD_RUN_PATH+\\\\:$LD_RUN_PATH} -L../.././lib/Xaw -lXaw -L../.././lib/Xmu -lXmu -L../.././lib/Xt -lXt -L../.././extensions/lib -lXext -L../.././lib/X -lX11 -L/usr/wgep/X11R5.sos5/lib  -lsocket -lnsl -ltermcap Undefined                       first referenced  symbol                             in file index                               /usr/ucblib/libtermcap.a(termcap.o) rindex                              /usr/ucblib/libtermcap.a(termcap.o) ld: fatal: Symbol referencing errors.

In that post you stated that the \\\"wrap\\\" was on top of and in addition to any overhead. Geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true.   Come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing what and who is working on integration. This is simply an ad hominum attack and you know it.   Of course there is a fee. It is for administration. Geez Allen any organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate costs, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support a program and \\\"wrap\\\" as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you say is not true. Which is it Allen?   As you have posted on this subject Allen, you state that wrap is over and above overhead and is a seperate charge. You admit here that this is wrong. Nasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get some numbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then howl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.   Integration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was  done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of Reston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There is no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project that it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for  Apollo?   Oh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big. They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it replaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your bias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just how wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it.    I agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful large scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that integration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called leadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for the success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership and responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up as Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC and they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to finally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.  There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that for a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of leadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a symptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your efforts that you do not see this.   No, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have  happened in the first place.  I have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is at reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened, totally ignoring the lack of leadership of congress.

An analogy someone used a while back can perhaps illustrate it.  Say, for example, there are people living on a volcanic island, and a group  of geologists determine that a volcano is imminent. They warn the people on  the island that they are in danger, and should leave. A group of people on  the island is given the task of warning others of the danger.  They believe the danger is real, but others may not.   Does that mean that the first group are NECESSARILY arrogant in warning  others of the danger? Does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs  are correct, and all others are false?  Some might indeed react to opposition with arrogance, and behave in an  arrogant manner, but that is a personal idiocyncracy.

The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.    Contents:  * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key? * What references can I start with to learn cryptology? * How does one go about cryptanalysis? * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance? * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem? * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice? * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are   relatively easy to break?   * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?    The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted   acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A   by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone   who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.    A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so   that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is   the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art   of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when   you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both   cryptography and cryptanalysis.    The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is   called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert   plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert   ciphertext into plaintext.    A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The   algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,   Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different   values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.    The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are   called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,   eavesdroppers, or third parties.  * What references can I start with to learn cryptology?    For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given   in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,   concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,   these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has   developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and   mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is   encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up   to the mid-60's.    Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or   Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want   to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common   mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.    The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of   many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently   several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The   book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range   of security including encryption algorithms, database security,   access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments   apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].    The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite   technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in   the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of   DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses   of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on   modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management   and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and   networks.    The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on   the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.  * How does one go about cryptanalysis?    Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of   analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern   finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available   textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series   [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for   the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given   systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the   cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still   classified.    Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,   or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare   of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the   most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.  * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?    In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can   find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.    Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding   ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the   plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or   decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.   Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this   brute-force search is impractical.        Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered   practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years   now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with   this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the   mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic   decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel   machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.   Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].    One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a   brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.  * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?    The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key   rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.    A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The   unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of   ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and   if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount   of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is   probably strong.    A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears   random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).        A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A   system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.    If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily   strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.   However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is   strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then   he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring   integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.  * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?    Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical   cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your   ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might   assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is   correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the   rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same   plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus   he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he   doesn't have a chance.    Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused.

However, I don't know anyone who has one.  I have my eye on two choices.  Dexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software Catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.  Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales (according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169 mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.  I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400 dpi) and price ($149).    Basically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the best buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of prices.  Which should I buy?

Thanks a lot \",\" Except for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plants are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling towers designed and built in the 1890's (a hundred years ago) for coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways.  Basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling and the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the hot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is rapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently seen rising out of these towers.  That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.  The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference (sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage \\\"hot\\\" turbine to final stage \\\"cold\\\" turbine).

Alan\",\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis   To:  shaig@Think.COM  Subject: Ten questions to Israelis  Dear Shai,  Your answers to my questions are unsatisfactory.  In the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence of Israeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information I have received from other quarters, according to which there are two distinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship (Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passports etc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all times and present them at many public places, almost every day. These ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab. You maintain that this mainly because of religious services provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ? Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it serves no other purpose ?  In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was established, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).  Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public official. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to Vanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.  Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning 'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from Ma'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?  You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been used by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet Union into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they would not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be very happy if you could convince me that what I am told about Israel were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so. I suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discussion.

I don't argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I just question whether you >should<.  The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we can't model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That has been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human perception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don't think it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather that the model be improved in a more explicable manner.  I guess I just haven't seen all these earth-shaking fractal models that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I really hope I do, but I'm not holding my self-similar breath.   Uh huh.  I'll believe it when I see it.  I've been chasing fractal compression for a few years, and I still don't believe in it.  If it's so great, how come we don't see it competing with JPEG?  'Cause it can't, I'll wager.  Actually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression work- and I was trying- because I don't think it's a reasonable alternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)  I'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That's why I don't think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical.

The team which was later to prosecute him on criminal charges had to sequester itself from all reports of ON's immunized testimony.

What happens to a Russian, to a Czech, does not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping their children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest to me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as the anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished. We shall never be rough and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans, who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these human animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worry about them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someone comes to me and says, \\\"I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women and children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them\\\", then I would have to say, \\\"you are a murderer of your own blood because if the anti-tank ditch is not dug, German soldiers will die, and they are the sons of German mothers.

This we must do, unless these one million Poles and those hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict untold damage on the German blood. Philosophizing is of no avail in this case.

People have said that religion is bad by any account, and that it is in no way useful, etc., but I don't totally agree with this.  Of course, we cannot really say how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion, but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it.  So basically, we can not judge whether religion is the right route for a given individual, or even for a general population.  We can say that it is not best for us personally (at least, you can choose not to use religion--might be hard to try to find out its benefits, as you state above).\",\" I wish I could agree with you.  Ask yourself this.  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least partially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly evaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released) The answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't.  There is other hardware out there not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.)  My suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper systems.  If not we're in trouble.  Given that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like to think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this. They know their initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never taken seriously.  The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You know little about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step in the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banning or SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the \\\"Clipper\\\" system is easily justified \\\"Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying to subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternative so use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever.\\\" How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system the only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can't, and the administration knows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for drug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.  Don't sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid. Either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations collective I.Q. is about that of a potato.  Why do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big, and NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it, noone will buy the stuff that doesn't have to.  AT&T must know this too, THINK MAN, why the hell would they jump the gun?   I really wonder.  To wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton:  The White House Office of the Press Secretary c/o: Presidential Comment Line (fax) (202) 456-2461   April 17, 1993   Sir and/or Madam:     I must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and cryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.   It is apparent to me that those who drafted the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \\\"Big Brother Proposal\\\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep      ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \\\"experts\\\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.   In addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \\\"tamper proof\\\" the key escrows might be.   I cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti      lize the \\\"Big Brother Chip.\\\"   Unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like \\\"harmony,\\\" \\\"right to encryption,\\\" and \\\"voluntary.\\\"   It mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is \\\"I can't believe it's happening here.\\\"  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; \\\"When is the Reichstag fire planned for?\\\"           Most Concerned,         [Signature]       Shaen Logan Bernhardt I uni@acs.bu.edu \",\" toyota has cornered the market on ugly station wagons. after seeing the new camry sedan, i had thought toyota would finally turn out something nice-looking.  the new camry station wagon bears a strong resemblance to a hearse, and a weird looking one at that.\",\"Graham E.

I have thought about the implications, and it is scary.    We have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have  decided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for the thrill of a younger, more attractive woman.  If we accept that it is legitimate for Jane to have divorced, how can we not accept anyone's decision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he can have a more \\\"deep, committed relationship.\\\"  Marriage is not a state of being, it is a mutual journey in life. Love is not a passive feeling, it must be actively willed.  Is it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many  years who stayed home to care for the children because he can't be happy sexually unless he is with a beautiful young blonde?  The real solution for both in the couple to make a renewed effort.    Hold fast to the faith.  Has not the Lord repeatedly compared His relation to His people as a faithful and enduring husband?  We learn something very deep and very mystical when we marry and remain faithful through times of trial.  My spouse has a brain tumor that has left her partially paralyzed. If it were to resume growing (it is in remission, thanks be to God!) then perhaps the time would come when we could not have sexual relations.  That's life...the Lord would certainly not give me permission to seek someone else to satisfy my \\\"needs.\\\"    The idea that it is alright to divorce if a couple \\\"grows apart\\\" seems to me to lead to such a monstrous destruction of the meaning of marriage that I feel we must make every effort to avoid any hint of compromise.

My opinion, FWIW, to all:  Mark, age doesn't matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays better than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las Vegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major league hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have the league data from the mid-80s to check it out.  That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to start the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league season in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very poorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill are not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers, they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around .220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on the Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at any level, at any age, doesn't satisfy MY standards of evidence.

Granted, I thought his behavior with McCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first time he ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But he has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is more valuable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24), had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor, EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF (which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15 best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching his \\\"prime\\\" season of 27.

After having it awhile I noticed two things about the function generator. For one, there seems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is, I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some random 50mV bias.  The other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output won't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed from my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input impedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have maximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have input impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to use my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing reasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my circuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series. With the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now with this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of a pain in  the ass.  Is there any way I could make myself a little box that could solve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator input, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some low, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd like to have this box not be active.  Any quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons I had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it.

Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sin is covered.   (Ps. 32:1).  and quoted by the apostle Paul:    Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God   imputeth righteousness without works,   Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins   are covered.   Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.  (Rom. 4:6-8)  The biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are parallel/equivalent concepts in both testaments.  The dispensational distinction is unwarranted.   I'm sure Rex has Scripture to back this up.  You're suggesting Jesus is going to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law -- for millions perhaps billions of people.  Such activity for Moses the lawgiver was considered unwise (cf. Ex. 18:13ff).  It makes for interesting speculation, though.  I'll leave comments on the so-called \\\"bema seat\\\" vs. \\\"throne\\\" judgments to someone else.  This also seems like more unnecessary divisions ala dispensationalism. \",\"   I would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors (of the squeaky-clean, traditional crew-cut, talk to the AMA before starting any treatment, kind) who recommend treatments that, though \\\"accepted\\\", may not be necessary for the patient at the time.  And all for making a quick buck.  I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the U.S. is significantly inflated by these \\\"quacks of a different color\\\".  In fact, I'd say these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the true focus of the medical profession.  The AMA and the Boards should focus on these \\\"quacks\\\" instead of devoting unbelievable energy on 'search-and- destroy-missions' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non- traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients that traditional/accepted medicine cannot help.   *************************************************** Now to make a general comment on many recent posts: ***************************************************  Lately I've seen the word \\\"quack\\\" bandied about recklessly.

JPEG (pronounced \\\"jay-peg\\\") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of \\\"natural\\\", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is \\\"lossy\\\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of \\\"realistic\\\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File    Size in bytes  Comments  ship.ppm 1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits     or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z  963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress     compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.     Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif  240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif     Most of the savings is the result of losing color     info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95  155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)     This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,     at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75   58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)     You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this     from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50   38406  cjpeg -Q 50     This has slight defects; if you know what to look     for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing     the original.  Still as good image quality as many     recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25   25192  cjpeg -Q 25     JPEG's characteristic \\\"blockiness\\\" becomes apparent     at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).     Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were     of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o    6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)     Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or     indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:     the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good \\\"quality\\\" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  \\\"Quality 95\\\" does NOT mean \\\"keep 95% of the information\\\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \\\"op art\\\".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just \\\"high\\\"/\\\"medium\\\"/\\\"low\\\"-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \\\"How to find sources\\\". (If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with \\\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\\\" in the body.  The \\\"Anonymous FTP List FAQ\\\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for \\\"canned\\\" software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  John Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu or ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the version number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on export or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits internally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to convert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first. But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG. CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check the \\\"save at normal size\\\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it's functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) \\\"msdos/graphics\\\" at Simtel20, that really means \\\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\\\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) \\\"/pub/msdos/graphics\\\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip     Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip     PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \\\"AugJPEG\\\", \\\"NewAmyJPEG\\\", \\\"VJPEG\\\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris, but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The \\\"official\\\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article \\\"How to find sources\\\", referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \\\"JFIF\\\" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called \\\"color quantization\\\".  (This is something of a misnomer, \\\"color selection\\\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \\\"smeared\\\" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as \\\"256-color JPEG\\\".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit \\\"hi-color\\\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying \\\"-Q 100\\\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say \\\"-sample 1x1\\\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to \\\"do their own thing\\\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \\\"low-end\\\" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a \\\"high-end\\\" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \\\"lowest common denominator\\\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     \\\"raw JPEG\\\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it's worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is   \\\"begin\\\" line  M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with   \\\"begin\\\" line  M:'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different \\\"back end\\\" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The \\\"fair use\\\" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (\\\"ghost\\\" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \\\"dithered\\\" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to \\\"smooth\\\" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try \\\"-smooth 10\\\" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that \\\"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\\\" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net. \",\"Does anyone know of any recent information on the Frescoe work being done by the Consortium?

It has since been treated \\\"effectively\\\".  In other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.  During the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over my daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday visitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study books to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.  Last fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings. At that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time, I started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend. I did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a religious community.  Today, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for  Communion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine (The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the pew in front of us.  I feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her religious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments if you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.  My daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and mature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly for religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with my daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.  My initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith in Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays with her again.  I do not want to \\\"drive her from the fold\\\", and would be willing to allow her to continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only for two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.  Any suggestions?  If you have a response, please e-mail me a copy. (I'm not a regular reader of this newsgroup.) (Naturally, feel free to post too!)  Thanks, and I hope you've had a happy Easter.

I am using a Diamond Speedstar HiColor video card with 1 meg VRAM and a standard CTX 14-in SVGA monitor.  When I am running Windows, and I have overlapping windows (say an application overlapping the program manager window), and I close the active application, window erasure is very slow.  The part of the window that is not overlapping is erased first, very slowly.  This also happens when I iconify an application.  The HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card, but it does not have an accelerator chip on it.  I am running at 800x600x32k.  Is this slow speed simply to be expected without an accelerator chip, or is there something else that is bottlenecking the system that I am unaware of?  Thanks.\",\" One rule of thumb is that if a person is making the claim, they are wrong.  I was just reading John 14 this morning (I think that is the right chapter, anyway it is close and I don't have a Bible at work to check with.) and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about his impending death and he says that he will be going away and then later he will be with them.  He said something along the lines of \\\"I will be in you and you will be in me.\\\"  (Again I cannot provide the exact quote or citation.)  Anyway, my understanding of this is that the Second Coming will not be an outward event.  It is an inward event, Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him. If you look for a person you will be deceived.  It seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that would be a political or military leader and so didn't recognize Jesus when he came.  Jesus tried to show that his Kingdom was not of this earth. A lot of what I have seen written about the Second Coming seems to based on an expectation of Christ coming back and finally taking over the world and running it the way it should be.  It sounds a lot like what the Jews were looking for.  The First Coming wasn't like that and I see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that either.  Oh and by the way, I don't expect it to happen once.  There is no one Second Coming, there are a lot of little ones.  Every time Christ comes into someones heart, Christ has come again.

The resolution you requested is about 0.3mV In order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower than that.  It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect inside a PC.  Before you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a low distortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD.  Digital Domain ?  There are possibly other low THD sources)  Run the digitized waveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor on the spectrum.  That's should give you a good indication of the design. (That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed - I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet.)  If you can live with 14 bit resolution, I would recommend looking at the MAX121 from MAXIM.  It is a high speed (308KHz) complete sampling A/D with DSP interface.  The input range is +/- 5V and it uses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolated from the computer to elinimate a major noise source)  The Analog design guide I got from them shows a -100db noise level.  They claim a -77db max (-85 typ.) THD.  Looks pretty good for the $12 @ 1000 pieces  A evaluation kit is available.

This assumes that you can build your own DAS and write your own software. (Hey you can get the MAX121 as a free sample just by calling the 1-800 #)   I would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out of your system by looking at the noise level, otherwise you might be throwing out your money.

Oh if this would not work any idears on how to make it work???   thanks       alex\",\" I would suggest skipping olwm and getting olvwm instead. This version of the olwm window manager implements a virtual desktop that I find really handy even on large monitors.   This version is also available at export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/olvwm3.tar.Z. The README file also suggest getting the files in /contrib/xview3.  In my case, I built the X Server first, Xview second, then olvwm. All of these were installed into /usr/X5. Once I verified the server worked correctly, I happily issued \\\"rm -rf /usr/openwin/*\\\".  Using gcc 2.3.3 to build all of the above resulted in a windowing system that  is, for all intents and purposes, identical to OpenWindows 3.0 and that is      incredibly faster. There is a bit of tweaking you will have to do if you want things to work _exactly_ like OpenWindows, but not much.  \",\"...

Jim  -- jmd@handheld.com\",\" my $.02 - Yes and No.  I do not believe the above scenario is not possible.   Either they are believing and living (in at least some part) led by God, else  they are not.  Believing (intellectually, but waiting(?)) is not enough.    Especially important to remember is that no one can judge whether you are  so committed, nor can you judge someone else.  I guess the closest we can  come to know someone's situation is listening to their own statements.  This  can be fallible, as is our sense of communion one with another.   Regarding this passage, we need to remember that this is a letter to a church  (at Laodicea), people who are Of the Body of Christ. (Rev.3:14-16)  He talks  about their works.  A translation could say that he says their lack of  concern makes him sick (to the point of throwing up).     Right, saving is by faith alone, except that faith does not come alone, if  you catch the two meanings.    I can offer the explanation that Jesus would that we were either \\\"on fire  for Him\\\" or so cold we knew we were not in His will and thus could be made  aware of our separation.  This is admonishment for His children, not eternal  damnation.  \",\" I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling or perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points. However, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I feel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more.   IMHO  Dave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not think he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the game. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I still would not back him for the Hall of Fame.  Dave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are (in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a bit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he was with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I think it deserves some consideration.  Lee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of Kingman.  Darrell Evans - No.  Eddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although a silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not sure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both the average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just think, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.  Jeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the top of my head I would take Lee Smith first.   Well, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I talked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers offensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have shattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved games? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more than numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers). Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does George Brett who also belongs in this class of player.   Steve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone making a case for him.   Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might bring up his name.  Kirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still has time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately.  Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him having some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not hear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even top 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame because of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers - even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL the possible votes.  So in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do but I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.  Yes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan Maybe - Murray and L. Smith No - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman  As I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this up - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.\",\"  (Deletion)   For me, it is a \\\"I believe no gods exist\\\" and a \\\"I don't believe gods exist\\\".   In other words, I think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere with this world are false or meaningless. In Ontology, one can fairly conclude that when \\\"A exist\\\" is meaningless A does not exist. Under the Pragmatic definition of truth, \\\"A exists\\\" is meaningless makes A exist even logically false.   A problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a subjective god by definition, and there might be cases where a subjective god would even make sense. The trouble with most god definitions is that they include some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting all. Believers derive from it a right to interfere with the life of others.     (Deletion)\",\" Since we are talking in theory and opinion, then I'll put in my $.02.  First, a rebuttle. Personally, I love under-dogs. Unlike  bandwagon jumpers, I abandon teams when they start winning. People that cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are afraid to be associated with something negative.   On this one point, I agree. The reason that people bash WASP's is  because they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top is going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top. If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people  for all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had  conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any better/worse than the whites did.  The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of the world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done (ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to the present generation who didn't participate in the crimes? Would it do  any good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stopped hundreds, even thousands, of years ago.   My opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let's change them. But don't blame me for what my ancestors did. It wouldn't settle anything anyway.   That's where you are dead wrong. You don't join up on a side just because they are winning. That makes you spineless. Winning, in high school and after high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't make you right. All the best causes in history were loosing causes (with only a couple exceptions). Winning only makes a difference to other people, not to yourself. And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care how you appear (ie. a Winner).   If you can't beat them, fight them every inch of the way.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \\\"At that moment the bottom fell out of Authur's mind.

Agricultural slavery might # #have lasted right up to the first mechanical cotton reaper, but no # #further; reapers are cheaper than slaves, and don't have to be fed during # #the winter.  #  # This argument makes a several fundamental errors.  First \\\"agricultural\\\" # slavery was not limited to production of cotton.  In the American south # slave labor was used extensively to grow tobacco, sugar, and rice, all # of which remained labor intensive enterprises well into the 20th century.  And of course, in states like Kentucky and Virginia, not well-suited to large-scale plantations, slave labor was used to make one of the most  valuable agricultural products of all: more slaves.  In some ways, this treatment of humans beings as breeding livestock is the most horrifying aspect of American slavery.  # Second, although mechanization of cotton production could be expected to # reduce the demands for labor eventually, it was only in the 1940's  # the mechanization of cotton production in the South largely eliminated # the labor intensive character of the operation, long after the \\\"first # mechanical cotton reaper\\\" was invented.  This is an interesting question.  Steinbeck's _Grapes of Wrath_ (published in the 1930s), uses agricultural mechanization of cotton production in Arkansas as the cause of the Joad family being evicted from the land.  How many years were involved in the mechanization of cotton farming?

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers) =====================================================================  I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?  1. Free options  The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.  Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will  be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86  is listed below.   X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was  done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).  It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.  There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,  X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you  don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).  X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).  2. Commercial options       1) Metro Link  2213 W.

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?  3. What is XFree86?     XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with    X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and    other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:      1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,        selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require        an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of        1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by        default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield        up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.     2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default        operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now        equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately        20% faster than X386 1.2.     3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,        or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4        with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from        SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.     4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.        Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about        the ATI and Trident drivers.     5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's        code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).     6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is        compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the        contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.     7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font        renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary        distributions.     8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.     9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA        cards is now included.     The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2    (they were not in XFree86 1.1):      1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of        available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200         (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).     2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the        monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \\\"two        headed\\\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only        been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).     3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.     4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to        consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for        more information.)     5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some         versions of these devices were not previously compatible).     6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor        timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous        documentation and a lot of experimentation).     7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including        implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many         vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more         information).     8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has        been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of        0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks        line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.     9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig        configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative        and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new        options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1)         manual page for more information on the format of this file).         Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file        in the source distribution for full details.     Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the    current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.  4. What OSs are supported?      XFree86 supports:  SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2  SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC  SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2  Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1   BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active  BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.   Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,  but anyone should feel free to submit patches.  If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to  xfree86@physics.su.oz.au  5. What video hardware is supported?     At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:   Tseng ET4000  Tseng ET3000  Paradise PVGA1  Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of   the PVGA1, and use its driver)  Genoa GVGA  Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000  ATI 18800, 28800   All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,  with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in  256 color mode.   The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of  video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the  ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome  server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.   It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to  non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To  avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86  1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel  clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are  discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how  these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such  a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with  future XFree86 releases.   If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,  it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the  Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not  work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.  In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond  products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions  of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).  If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.   Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA  video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the  CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It  could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset  on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot  of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested  theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not  working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86  working fine on them.  6. What about accelerated boards?   At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards  like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available  in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).   An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact  <hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.   A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>  or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.  7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?   The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the  16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory  contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-  planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each  of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-  buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled  16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code  could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).  But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer  implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,  but nothing is yet available from the project.  8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?   Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run  X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.  The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending  on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).  To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will  be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable   lower bound.  9. Where can I get source for XFree86?   Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22  from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:   export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)   ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)   ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)  (For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)   Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information  on which files you need to get to build your distribution.  10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?   Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from:   ftp.physics.su.oz.au  - SVR4 binaries    under /XFree86/SVR4   ftp.win.tue.nl   - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/XFree86/SVR4   ferkel.ucsb.edu   - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/SVR4/XFree86   stasi.bradley.edu  - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/XFree86/SVR4   blancmange.ma.utexas.edu - SVR3 (ISC) binaries    under /pub/ISC   ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries    under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86   tsx-11.mit.edu   - Linux binaries    under /pub/linux/packages/X11   agate.berkeley.edu  - 386BSD binaries    under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86   ftp.cs.uwm.edu   - Mach binaries    under /i386   Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may  archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will  contain a README file that describes what files you need to take  from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were  made when building the distribution.  IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?  11. Installation directories   The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot  (/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include  files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.   This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified  via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is  nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed  alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.  12. Configuration files   The XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\\\"Xconfig\\\") on startup.  The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in  the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.  13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes   David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known  clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.  The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and  is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is  also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on  export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated  occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the  settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to  David for inclusion in the database.   If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file   with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.  It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use  this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information  to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.   NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and        is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot        clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from        your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The        server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.        You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your        Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up        starting the server in the future.  14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit   If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to  reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is  fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.  V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?   First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).  15. SVR4  Why won't my xterm run properly?   If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define  CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.  csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'   The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping  problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be  installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.  16. SVR3   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.  17. 386BSD   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.   Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey  <Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the  file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:       agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2      wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2      grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2  18. Linux   You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc  jump libraries installed.   Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.   If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to  run the server as \\\"X -pn\\\". The default startup configuration assumes  that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files  /usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the  -pn argument to X386.   Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major  number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not  owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit  console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but  startx won't.   When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with  a tty, for example \\\"xdm < /dev/console &\\\".   For more detailed information, please read the file README present  with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.  19. Mach   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.  VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?   This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is  fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.  Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.  VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?  20. BSD compatibility library   A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.  The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a  which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),  seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include  <X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro  definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are  linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these  functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a  21. ANSICCOPTIONS   This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the  ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite  the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see  something like   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of   ANSICCOPTIONS=\\\"-ansi\\\"   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:   ANSICCOPTIONS=  to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death  with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because  CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must  add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.  XFree86 Contact Information      Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86     Core Team.

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers every 21 days.   Contents  * How do I recover from lost passwords in WordPerfect? * How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher? * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...] * Is the UNIX crypt command secure? * How do I use compression with encryption? * Is there an unbreakable cipher? * What does ``random'' mean in cryptography? * What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)? * What is key management and why is it important? * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream? * What is the correct frequency list for English letters? * What is the Enigma? * How do I shuffle cards? * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM? * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers? * What is the coding system used by VCR+?   * How do I recover from lost passwords in WordPerfect?    WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.   The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password   and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full   descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli   [BER91].    decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution.    There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,   Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will   decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox   files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you   think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a   call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files   that have a 10 char or less pw key.''  * How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?    A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the   plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.   If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the   following:     1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.   (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of   the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal.    If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something   over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different   key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes   of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which   indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.    2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This   removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since   English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of   text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing   plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact   one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)    If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a   standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis   texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in   the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.   See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].  * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]    Here's one popular method, using the des command:      cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail    Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called   PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through   1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.   There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this   writing.    There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting   mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own   newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ   as well.    PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm   without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)   in the USA.    RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which   is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside   the USA.    Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of   the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the   message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there   have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and   algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as   we know).  * Is the UNIX crypt command secure?    No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt   breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks   on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].  * How do I use compression with encryption?    A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by   some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).    Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact   distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's   impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse   characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up   more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy   has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some   redundancy in your compressed output.    Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they   have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that   actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of   UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''   that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.      This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a   bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means   removes the need for strong encryption.    Compression after encryption is silly.  * Is there an unbreakable cipher?    Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the   one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as   plaintext.    Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be   useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by   likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is   expected to remain valid.  * What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?    Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom   number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be   cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to   predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of   the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of   0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.    A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function   of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently   random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by   the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps   generated by a hardware random number source).    Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,   generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of   entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,   cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo    gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in   it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,   for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random   string.    When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is   important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that   because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \\\"random\\\".  For   example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be   unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a   clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.  * What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?    See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount   of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in   the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number   of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this   can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to   back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis.    Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have   multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security   from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.    Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic   measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives   probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext   for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible   plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys   are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally   deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine   the likelihood of events of interest.    Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than   D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not   enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of   possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,   which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to   8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but   the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work   required to find the key after approximately D characters have been   intercepted.    In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used   in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key   size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if   it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few   practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all   manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack   some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic   considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a   recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.   Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and   information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most   promising directions.    Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information   statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal   1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the   possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].  * What is key management and why is it important?    One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in   full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,   and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of   course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling   Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)   Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can   eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in   modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are   transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but   also enough key material to cover the traffic.    Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and   handling of keys.    A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology   is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use   employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key   Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that   certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control   personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and   to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the   reporting of lost CIKs.    This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management   problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,   many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''  * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?    Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from   relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a   linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random   number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds   and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a   high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically   this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for   cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more   complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---   but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable   structure at all.    See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].  * What is the correct frequency list for English letters?    There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than   the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:   namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of   English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,   but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.    The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do   you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a   fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It   has changed over time; it is different between different authors.   Any particular message will have different statistics from those of   the language as a whole.    The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have   exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all   reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.   In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other   buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood   estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a   text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with   reasonably robust answers.    So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will   be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.  * What is the Enigma?    ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of   information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by   the British during WWII.''    See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].  * How do I shuffle cards?    Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of   values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output   permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you   need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly   distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that   function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH   is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two   addresses given)    for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;    modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since   ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the   error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s   modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less   than y, go back and get another ranno() value.   * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?    Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with   possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted   separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps   even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.    As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard   PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the   keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be   encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in   part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one   of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.    If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must   be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in   the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.   The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the   illegal copy.   * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?

You must find things like the Moon *really* obnoxious in their pollution.  A few questions for those frothing at the mouth to ask themselves:   1) How long is this thing supposed to stay up?  Sounds like it would have a *huge* drag area, not a lot of mass, and be in a fairly low orbit.   2) Just what orbital parameters are we talking about here? What real impact are we talking about, really?  How many optical astronomers are *really* going to be impacted?   3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of 'seeing' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data the sensors are supposed to return along with the data for large inflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)? The choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising is being used to help fund this thing.   4) If your answer to 3) above was \\\"the astronomers\\\", then feel free to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more important research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.

Baptizing people in the name of three things != trinity. If this is the case, then I'm wrong, I assumed that trinity implies that God is three entities, and yet the same.  Cheers, Kent\",\" [..]   Hello.  Firstly, what do you exactly mean by \\\"fundamentalist\\\"?  I will for the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes that the bible is God's word to mankind?  I suspect that what happened to him is what he'll call being \\\"born again\\\"?  Anyway, was that recent? If the answer is \\\"yes\\\" to all the questions above, it is quite understandable.  However, IMO, I'ld rather give advice to your friend! I think I've been through something similar to him, and one thing I can say is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to communicate from different worldviews.  Why he talks about those things is because they are now \\\"obvious\\\" to him.  What is \\\"obvious\\\" to him is not obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because from his point of view, he has been on \\\"both sides of the fence\\\".  This I mean that before he turned \\\"fundamentalist\\\", you two are agreeable because both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as if a new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the discovery of let's say a new continent, or a new planet.  To him, he's got to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than where he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now. You have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to you, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth that risk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand and listen to you as well.  At this moment, it may be difficult because he is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about, however, he may not realise that he's really putting you off.  [...]   So far, I've only been trying to explain things from his side.  However, I do understand how you feel too, because I wasn't a Christian for a good part of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or \\\"fundamentalists\\\" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their faith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately, \\\"religious belief\\\" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism is also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is inevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise), it will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take both sides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you can do your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he's trying to convince you about, that it's beyond you or not your concern \\\"for now\\\".  Don't tell him it's nonsense, because to him it is reality - and that would be a real insult.  He'll also have to be careful not to insult where you stand too.  Like I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too. I'll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a Christian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little differently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited and just blabbered away about what I've found!  To me, it was too good not to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didn't really care most of the time what they thought.  You will probably think he's crazy too - but God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in mind.  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real to him, he doesn't see why God can't be real to you too.  I don't know how helpful this is to you.  But all the best anyhow - this is quite a challenge for you to face.

The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age: in adults pneumococcus (the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia) is the most common cause, while in children Hemophilus influenzae is the most common cause.  What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis, which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in both groups, but with lower incidence in infants. This organism is also called the \\\"meningococcus\\\", and is the source of the common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in the press. Without prompt treatment (and even WITH it in some cases), the organism typically causes death within a day.   This organism, feared as it is, is actually grown from the throats of many normal adults. It can get to the meninges by different ways, but blood borne spread is probably the usual case.   Rifampin (an oral antibiotic) is often given to family and contacts of a case of meningococcal meningitis, by the way.  Sorry, but I don't have time for a more detailed reply.

I moved there from Novosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferred to Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name is Arutunian, my husband's name . . .  That there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints  and gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the  Russians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past  year. I couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because  I, I'll just say it, couldn't steal, couldn't deceive, and couldn't be  involved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they  told me, \\\"Leave, don't keep the others from working, you aren't cut out for  this kind of work.\\\" And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at  the Armenians, like \\\"The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way they've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live,\\\" and \\\"Things  will be just fine if we get rid of them all.\\\" \\\"No problem, the Turks will  help,\\\" they say, \\\"if we ask them, they'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an  hour.\\\" Well that's the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it  would spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn't imagine it.  Here we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one  even considered such an idea possible.  But I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative  people I would often ask, \\\"Where is this all leading, do people really not see what kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait,  there are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what's going on?\\\" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that  everything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of  it if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the demonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn't be saying this now if I  hadn't received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were  under guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade.  The women told me, \\\"There he is, there he is, that's Muslimzade.\\\" I didn't  believe the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that  they were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, \\\"Are you the First  Secretary of our City Party Committee?\\\" He answers me, \\\"Yes.\\\" And I ask him,  \\\"Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani  flag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don't know  exactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?\\\" And he tells me, \\\"Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it.\\\" Then I asked him another question: \\\"And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering  us? And he said, \\\"I. . . We didn't know what to do, we didn't know, we didn't  anticipate that that would happen in Sumgait.\\\"  Comrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the  Azerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: \\\"No, we actually didn't  anticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain  the crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre.\\\" Those are his  exact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the Armenian SSR.  And now, about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them,  because it may seem that it's not true to someone else. Various rumors  concerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't.  But unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so  horrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of progress, I don't know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in or around Moscow, I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really  a genocide, it was a massacre. That's genuinely what it was.  For example, on that day, the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my  husband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on  the 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, \\\"You're in bed? You don't  know anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they  were overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars  and asking, 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian, then they  turned the car over and burned it.\\\" This isn't made up, the wife of the Senior Investigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was  returning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she's my  neighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the  middle of it, I don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they  were stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him honk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it, and  I said, \\\"Certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?\\\" And she said,  \\\"Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely smashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw  that they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, \\\"Don't break  the shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want. \\\" I didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was torn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians  although he's an Azerbaijani.  While we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova is the first to look out the window and say, \\\"Look, there's a crowd out  there.\\\" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had  already started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian  family there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I  don't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my  husband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3.  There was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things  were going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once  wasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished the Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they  beat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing  the hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on  television, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell  us why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't  have touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the  Armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.  At the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there,  and so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly  off a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down  there, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At  first I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband,  \\\"Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there.\\\" And he answered, \\\"I  don't know, could be.\\\" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw  it, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way,  he didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging  her. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell  down, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their  balconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of  blocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two  from here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.  Then the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can of course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And I also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented that woman, because I had just seen that.  I asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, \\\"You kill me first, and then  let them do what they want with the corpse.\\\" But our neighbors, it's true,  defended us, they said, \\\"There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away,  only Muslims live here.\\\" Disaster missed us that time.  But at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately,  came back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's  upset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to  balcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as  though it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever,  and I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look  and the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first  time they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the  morning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the  Azerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them  too. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking garbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went  toward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you  could see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke  Azerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, \\\"What do you want?\\\" And  they answered, \\\"We want the Armenian family that lives here\\\" [pointing toward  the second floor with their hands]. She says, \\\"I already told you, we don't  have any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman  talking to you,\\\" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around her and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they  seemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing  and left. That was the second time death was at our door.  I forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there,  I don't know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we  really didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth  floor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight  months, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to  earn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture  and was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas, everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything  out the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on  the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that  hadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means  that the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to  be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been  foreseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of  apartments. Something on the order of \\\"We'll move the Armenians out and take  over their apartments.\\\"  I have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I  came as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the  Consulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I  knew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in  Sumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that Party membership was  bought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were  no ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw  all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.  I can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I went out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they  had arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some  Russian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and joined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with  the situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on  the buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure  people would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for  the Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But  having analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having  thought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people.  If a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed,  and that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to  calm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom he could whisper at the last minute, \\\"Go and announce it on television:  Citizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let's protect our  neighbors from this massacre?\\\" Those crowds weren't such that there was no  controlling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn't have firearms,  mostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature  shafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we  noticed them: there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were  brought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was  saying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend  us, why wasn't it arranged? It means that the government didn't want to do  it. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik,  what, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out! The crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won't mention the things  I didn't see myself, I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They  were in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when I saw them from the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one  o'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They hadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8.  When they returned to our building I told my husband, \\\"Lendrush, now the  police are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably  going to find out and come to our aid.\\\" Well, alas, no, there were to be no  authorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single  ambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out, beginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments, and burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned,  it was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in  Block 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they  attacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed soldiers, and how on that square, I can't remember the name of it, where there is that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I'm upset and I can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and  from the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers,  wearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against  that mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using  stones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have  guessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under  the Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under  Soviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get  involved.  If you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the truth, I've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five  years that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered  me a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I'm an adventure seeker, and some, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become outraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a  Soviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property, or the property of some magnate, or some \\\"mafia\\\": If I want to, I'll get you  out of here; If I want to, I'll get rid of you; If I want to, I'll do  something else? And there's a black market price for everything, in the most  brazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so much. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had  the nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, I'm afraid, I heard with my own ears: \\\"Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something that you know will never have any effect? You're alone against everyone, so  instead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything  will go fine for you.\\\" I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I  do, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless. And the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see it. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed  it, I still have a copy, but what's the use? When the General Procuracy got  involved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to  the information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony  about the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don't know  if they're going to pursue it or not. Because, you'll excuse me, I no longer  believe in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It's all  dead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most  important, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that's nonsense, that all comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in  you--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...  I want to tell of one incident. I just don't know, at the time I was in such a state that I didn't even take minor things into account. Here is an example. Of course, it's not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a son, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy, Vitaly [Danielian], I don't know his last name, goes to school with him, or rather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to make a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there's one important detail: When the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in  Armenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments. But the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call  anywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off for no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they liked They weren't afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap  their hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.  Now I'm going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an Armenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class.  According to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the same apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put through--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to his mother and said, \\\"Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they kill him? Maybe he's still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow. . . . He's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart.\\\" His  mother wouldn't let him go. In tears, she says, \\\"Valery, you can't go because  I am afraid.\\\" He says, \\\"Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch,  just have a look.\\\" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's parents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a  superficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken  everywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian  apartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that  the windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows  in that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and  Vitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already  been murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks  ago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we  left Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to  Yerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this  straight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family has been killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and his classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit  them, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in  a coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being  kicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought  there in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .  When we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another,  throw ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if  these friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And when you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When you saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.  If you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of  things it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped  were entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I'm not lying,  that girlfriend came up to one of them and said, \\\"What happened?\\\" and she  bared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . .  those rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that  I don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.  Now . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided, well, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny, some six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group of people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a point when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw so much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .  Yes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians around Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground with bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who  don't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when  I arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are  not only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they  were guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a  single person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan  all the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack  anyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there could have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are  guilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in Azerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not only perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it  seems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; \\\"Did  you know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31  people, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an  Armenian?\\\"  Of course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and not become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to the time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee. When I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I  couldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already mentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, \\\"Why  did you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at  these women who are strewn about on the floor?\\\" The overcrowding there was  tremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were already sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They  cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but  the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at  it everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they  were never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized to do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening that Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait,  was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored  personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart  advised him, and relocate people to the military unit.  But that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically,  tried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party Committee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the hand and said, \\\"Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office. I told him, \\\"No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of  what you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the  traces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . \\\" Oh  yes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even  very funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice,  expensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, \\\"Oh, why  did you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume, you're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came to ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are already getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at them?\\\" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who  he was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head  and hid it. Then I said, \\\"My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We  didn't come to you with the intention of stealing!\\\" \\\"Well kill me, kill me!\\\"  Muslimzade says to me, \\\"But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not guilty.\\\" And I say, \\\"OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give  us an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and  raping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things,  carrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you  then?\\\" \\\"You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't  anticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.\\\" I started  laughing and said, \\\"It's truly funny.\\\" He says, \\\"What could I do? We didn't  know what to do.\\\" And I say, \\\"I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell  you: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in  front with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross  over his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was  during the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself; either he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran  away, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid,  excuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you,  you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done?  That's right,\\\" I told him, \\\"the City party committee got confused, all the  party committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused,  they all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with  impunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two  days, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would  have finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some  Russians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told  them, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too.\\\"  And by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was the one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later arrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to the military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We  asked him, \\\"What? How? What will come of us?\\\" He openly said, \\\"You know, for  us the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll stay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later.\\\" The  General Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all  cities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because  the affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke; as everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When  he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit,  by the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it,  because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen,  and he said, \\\"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's horrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely  punished, in accordance with our laws.\\\" And that's a quote. Then one mother  throws herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says, \\\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\\\" They tried  to calm her down, and he said, \\\"In order for us to conduct a proper  investigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you  must help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang  who is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe  someone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that  you're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having  lived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth  about, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge  later. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you  can throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The  names of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the information. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is  necessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening  gibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put  the information into the urn.\\\"  Two soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people,  people who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she  came up and said, \\\"You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as  will happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you  please write it down for me.\\\" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like her . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down everything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if  it will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that  information. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply  can't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example,  should someone say that black is white if it is really black?     The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani SSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council  of Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the  one who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their  previous dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him,  and it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very  politely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and  when I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, \\\"Where were you personally when they were beating us? Now you're trying to convince us to  return, why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where  it was all leading?\\\" he says, \\\"You're telling the truth. Let's not mince  words. You've told me right to my face, and I'll tell you straight. I'll tell  you the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole  government was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about  45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its  fine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku.\\\" I say, \\\"So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting  it?\\\" And he says, \\\"You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it  in Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . \\\" I say, \\\"Fine,  you didn't know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have  known. Why did no one help us?\\\" And he says, \\\"Well, OK, we didn't know what to do\\\" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from  Muslimzade. Later, when he said, \\\"You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is  favorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the  Azerbaijanis . . . \\\" To this l answered, \\\"You know what . . . I'm speaking  with you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with  Armenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me,  please, Comrade Mamedov, \\\" I asked him, \\\"What would you say about this honestly, if you were being completely frank with us?\\\" Then he said, \\\"Yes, I  admit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we  have disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before  the whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign  radio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too.\\\" And I say, \\\"There's nothing to add to what really happened. I don't think it's possible to add anything more awful.\\\" He says, \\\"Yes, I agree with you, I  understand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence.\\\" I repeat that he said \\\"unfortunate occurrence.\\\" And then he suddenly remembered himself, what  he was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously-- and said, \\\"Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . \\\" I take this to mean that  he really thinks it's an \\\"unfortunate occurrence.\\\" \\\"And of course,\\\" he says,  \\\"I understand that having gone through all this you can't return to Sumgait,  but it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being  tried.\\\" And he even gave a detail, which, I don't know if it matters or not,  that 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody  affair.  Yes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in Baku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an  Azerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, \\\"What, they didn't nail your husband? They screwed up.\\\" I was floored, I hadn't imagined that anyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up to see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was going to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from  February 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, \\\"I don't know,  Tatyana, go to the head of the conductors' pool. Be grateful if they don't  put it down as unexcused absence.\\\" I was really discouraged by this. They all  know that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here  they're telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying  myself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name is Rasulov, and he's had that position for many years. Incidentally, he's a  Party member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and  said, \\\"Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . \\\" He looked at me askance and said, \\\"And why are you\\\"--he knows me by my previous last name--\\\"why did you get wrapped up in this mess?\\\" I say, \\\"What do you mean, why did I get  wrapped up in this mess? My husband's an Armenian,\\\" I tell him, \\\"I have an  Armenian last name.\\\" And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as  though he had eaten something sour, and said, \\\"I didn't expect that you would . . . \\\" What did he mean by that? And \\\"how\\\" should he behave, the chief of the pool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it's true, there was a  reduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And  if someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what  can you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?! He's going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this,  the Armenians are like that, and so on . . .  By the way, that Mamedov--now I'm going back to Mamedov's office when I asked  him \\\"Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return  to Sumgait?\\\" he answered, \\\"Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don't want to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I  won't guarantee them for longer than 50 years.\\\" I say, \\\"So you've got another thing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they'll be quiet and then  in another 50 years it'll happen again?!\\\" I couldn't contain myself any more, and I also told him, \\\"And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew about it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in  Sumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received complaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did  everyone ignore what was going on?

Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good.  \\\"We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of  the Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of  Armenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in Sumgait.\\\" When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, ' \\\"Well, I walked down the street.\\\" And I said, \\\"Walking down the street in any  city, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation because I would be a guest, I don't have any contact with people, but if you  spend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn't  know you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you'd  hear something quite different.\\\" I told him, for example, that I drew my  conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took us all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit; they got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the  neighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I  thought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general, of a mass nature, some anti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it was the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier  accompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything  there were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with us, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young  people, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they  were making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when police detachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and  tanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when  the situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they  withdraw protection from the city altogether?

Brendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17 seconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals. Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good goaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the stretch to preserve the Blues lead.  The Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and taking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty on Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the blue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired a long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After the goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks 10-9 in the first period.  Jeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on the left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown collected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.  Two minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a short-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy Roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass across the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.  Noonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1. Stephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat Stephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan deflected the puck in the net.  Denny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the rebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for the shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards to Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues outshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.  With the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked up a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith was called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.  The Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into the two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot, and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and passed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp angle.  Just 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson Emerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with two Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the slot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.  The Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph made some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy Murray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game. The Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held on to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period, totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent in the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on on four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in the league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play.   The game was carried live on ABC, the first time an NHL game other than an All-Star game has been shown on network television since May 24, 1980, when CBS carried Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals.

This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason to believe it still goes on.  Read this:  From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992  PUBLICATION BAN          The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many         years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were         sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of         their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever         being made public.  By Baruch Me'iri  All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way or another: \\\"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published\\\".  The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest, and later on their imprisonment.  In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of this country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison, for security offenses, in complete secrecy.  In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA] affair -- we heard about \\\"the third man\\\" being in prison.  But many years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former Communist countries.  But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.  The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:  \\\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner\\\", asserts MK Zucker.  On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \\\"There is absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public.  \\\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\\\"  Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question.  \\\"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret\\\", wrote Zucker.  The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that, \\\"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter\\\".  \\\"The Union is aware\\\", says Shiffman, \\\"of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.  \\\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy...\\\"  Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible.  \\\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it.\\\"  -- Do you find this situation acceptable?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand, though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least are aware of his imprisonment.\\\"  -- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the discretion of the court?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which they can misuse.\\\"  -- And what if there really is a security issue?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.  Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public.\\\"  Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  \\\"A healthy situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security\\\".  A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir.  \\\"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.  \\\"Nevertheless\\\", adds Shtendal, \\\"the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned. The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\\\"  Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \\\"As a rule, clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances.\\\"\",\"Hi... can anybody give me book or reference title to give me a start at  fractal image compression technique.

Everyone,  Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess my question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:  The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere.  This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used. The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial Standard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold internationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!! How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most importantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?  I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year to specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear) is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not analytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things complicated. Please give me a hint.  I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not. However, so many people involved in the problem \\\"sphere from 4 poits\\\". Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?  Please post here and let the others share our interests  (I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the summary of the answers).\",\" I agree that there is truth in scripture.  There are principles to be  learned from it.  Claiming that that truth is absolute, though, seems  to imply a literal reading of the Bible.  If it were absolute truth  (constant across time, culture, etc.) then no interpretation would be  necessary.  It may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different  from person to person.  To me, that doesn't mean that one person is  right and the other is wrong.  I believe that God transcends our simple  minds, and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly  this intent.  God knows me, and knows that my needs are different  from yours or anyone else's.  By claiming that scripture is absolute, then at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrong. I just don't believe that God is that rigid.   This is where the arrogance comes in to play.  Since these principles  are crystal clear to evangelicals, maybe the rest of us should just take their word for it?  Maybe it isn't at all crystal clear to *me* that  their fundamental principles are either fundamental *or* principles.  I think we've established that figuring out Biblical truth is a matter  of human interpretation and therefore error-prone.  Yet you can still  claim that some of them may be crystal clear?  Maybe to a certain  segment of Christianity, but to all.   Not at all.  I think it supports my position much more effectively  than yours.  :-)  So, I think that your position is: The Bible is absolute truth, but as we are prone to error in our  interpretation, we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out  what that truth is. Did I get that right?  What's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending  absolute truth, when we can never know what those truths are, and we  can never (or at least shouldn't) act upon them?  What practical  difference can this make?\",\"I agree totally with you!  Amen!  You stated it better and in less world  than I did.\",\" That's the craziest thing I ever heard.

Way back in today's newspaper (Page A7 of San Francisco Chronicle)    there is an article about the document that held the proof.  [used without permission]   \\\"The document, which was discovered in the archives of the Soviet     Communist Party in Moscow, is a Russian translation of what is described     as a September 1972 report prepared for the Vietnam Politburo by General     Tran Van Quang, who is identified as the deputy chief of staff of the     North Vietnamese army.\\\"          [later on in the article after it talks about the claim of 1,205            Americans in North Vietnamese prisons]  \\\"Phong said the easiest way to prove that the document is a      fabrication is to review Quang's career. In 1972, he said, Quang was      not deputy chief of staff; he was the army commander in Military Region 4     in central Vietnam.\\\"  2) I heard on the radio that the Church of Scientology has filed for     bankrupcy becuase the employees of Cocolat , owned by CoS, filed a     class action suit against them for requiring the employees to pay dues    to become members of the Church.

People die for lies all the time.    Was Hitler a liar? How about Napoleon, Mussolini, Ronald Reagan? We spend millions of dollars a year trying to find techniques to detect lying? So the answer is no, they wouldn't be able to tell if he was a liar if he only lied about some things.   Why do you think he healed people, because the Bible says so? But if God doesn't exist (the other possibility) then the Bible is not divinely inspired and one can't use it as a piece of evidence, as it was written by unbiased observers.   Were Hitler or Mussolini lunatics? How about Genghis Khan, Jim Jones... there are thousands of examples through history of people being drawn to lunatics.   So we obviously cannot rule out liar or lunatic not to mention all the other possibilities not given in this triad.

No, but they could compell you to produce the key to a safe where, as it happens, evidence that will convict you is stored.

The test for compelled self-incrimination is whether the material to  be disclosed *in itself* tends to inculpate the discloser. In the example I gave above, the safe key itself has no testimonial value--ergo, it can be disclosed under compulsion (e.g., subpoena duces tecum).  Moreover, the government can always immunize the disclosure of a crypto key--compelling you to disclose the key at the price of not using the fact of your disclosure as evidence in the case against you.

We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we die.        Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG. Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high.   It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars, of which Christianity has had no small part.  When Christians see a \\\"non-believer\\\", they say that person is blind to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day.  Jesus was just prophet #37696  who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans were (circa 69ad) dispersing the Jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need.

The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits  for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution.   The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed  unsafe under federal air quality laws.        \\\"People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to  exacerbate that inflammation,\\\" said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental  Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  \\\"When people are on  the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over  the edge.\\\"       The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits  with daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter  of 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because  they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of  compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10  exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.        In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at  levels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30  microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with  asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.        The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory  Disease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung  Association's medical section.        The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that  particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study  by Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles  may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.   Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms  and bronchitis in children.        \\\"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\\\"  says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"But more and more research is showing that particles are  bad actors as well.\\\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate  air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated  pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex  and varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  acid aerosols.        \\\"Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects  of particulate air pollution,\\\" says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"We have no way of  duplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  \\\" Consequently, most of what  is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research  like the Seattle study.        Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur  dioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any  time soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with  asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.      \\\"In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only  cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's  rarely particulate matter,\\\" says Dr.  Schwartz.  \\\"However, PM10 doesn't have  to be near its violation range to be unhealthy.\\\"                                HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993                 NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma  The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on  Diagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in  dermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance  techniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care  professionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological  characteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management,  and followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi  and their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in  preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.  Following 2 days of  presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel  weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement.    Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a  distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins;  (2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential  for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical  excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and  extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4)  patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high  risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely;  (5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for  melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education  and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality  from melanoma.

Within the program, there are four types  of cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily  in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on  clinical research; \\\"comprehensive\\\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a  multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community  outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer  prevention and control research.    Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was  the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new  cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage  of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened  the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and  cancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew  progressively.    In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today,  there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria  for comprehensive status.    To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an  institution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly  established in 1990, the eight criteria for \\\"comprehensiveness\\\" include the  requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in  several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong  program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings  into clinical practice.    Moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly  beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also  referred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting  the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass  strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials,  significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important  outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of  sources.    The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and  capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit  important new findings or address timely research questions.

These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers  engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators  and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications  from new discoveries in the laboratory.    Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and  clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently  incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their  overall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today.    Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely  structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and  control research.  These centers interface with state and local public health  departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention  and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions  responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.   Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with  institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community  hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials.    Together, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward  creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through  interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the  laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

Specifically, we are interested in establishing this site as a clearinghouse  for personally developed software that has been developed for local medical  education programs.  We welcome all contributions that may be shared with  other users.    To connect to the UCI Medical Education Software Repository, ftp to:                        FTP.UCI.EDU  The Repository currently offers both MSDOS and Macintosh software, and we hope  to support other operating systems (UNIX, MUMPS, AMIGA?).    Uploads are welcome.  We actively solicit information and software which you  have personaly developed or have found useful in your local medical education  efforts, either as an instructor or student.    Once you have connected to the site via FTP, cd (change directory) to either  the med-ed/mac/incoming or the med-ed/msdos/incoming directories, change the  mode to binary and \\\"send\\\" or \\\"put\\\" your files.  Note that you won't be able to  see the files with the \\\"ls\\\" or \\\"dir\\\" commands.  Please compress your files as  appropriate to the operating system (ZIP for MSDOS; Compactor or something  similar for Macintosh) to save disk space.    After uploading, please send email to Steve Clancy (slclancy@uci.edu) (for  MSDOS) or Albert Saisho (saisho@uci.edu) (for MAC) describing the file(s) you  have uploaded and any other information we might need to describe it.

The  decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to  test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of  Health, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and   Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the  therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies  including Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH  that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is  intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the   replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's  reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the  MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.   \\\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the  next 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\\\" said Shalala.    Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine  Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had  convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested  simultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of  multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two  years.  ==================================================================       HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  \\\"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV\\\" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol.  114, No. 14, P. 18        AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was  approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome,  the manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the  drug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that  although HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk  of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit   disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of  the three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the  drug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S.  researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials,  many argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients  experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of   AIDS symptoms.

The real fear comes from them doing more than this.  This is a voluntary program, and thus harder for us to object to on the surface.  Their strategy is a business one rather than legal one.  They are pushing to get a standard in place, a secret standard, and if they get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market. It will be legal to sell better, untapable encryption that doesn't have registered keys, but it will be difficult, and thus not a plan for most phone companies.  You see, with clipper chip phones you'll be able to talk to any cellular company, or other phones or ports because they will follow the standard.  AT&T has already announced a clipper chip encryption product.  The government has marketed hard to get major vendors to use these chips.   If they get enough market share, they will rule.  And thus there will be very little market for systems that can't be tapped by the police.  The public isn't that concerned about it now, after all.  They freely do calls that anybody with an old TV can listen to today!  They won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure them only from the police.  Well, some people will buy these phones, but they will only work with other proprietary phones, so the market will be small and the phones expensive.  Unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them cheap, only the Mob will buy them.

Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations to Close Naval, Marine Reserve Centers  To: National Desk, Defense Writer  Contact: Herbert M. Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of           the United States, 202-479-2258     WASHINGTON, April 13 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Reserve Officers Association of the United States has alerted the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to give sufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers.    In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members of Congress with affected locations in their constituencies, including Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine list ignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior service personnel.    ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.), suggested \\\"concern that the only plausible alternative is that they are intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve components from maintaining even today's relatively low level of participation in their parent service's Total Force of the future.\\\"    He asked the commission \\\"to remove from consideration all locations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to warrant approval of the requested action.\\\"    \\\"Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve installations on this list are large enough to have a significant impact on the community, if closed,\\\" wrote Hultman.  \\\"The major issue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large percentage of the existing locations.\\\"    Hultman reminded the commission, \\\"The fact that the vast majority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come close to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this process certainly supports the thesis\\\" that these actions are simply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve.    ROA also noted \\\"that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of Naval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480 Naval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations are approved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities.\\\"    Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging from South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 Naval Reserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., to Missoula and Great Falls. Mont.  Naval/Marine Corps Reserve Centers include four in San Francisco, Fort Wayne, Ind., Billings, Mont., and Abilene, Texas.

INCREDIBLY CHOPPED UP POST I won't even try to tell you where the deletions came out    I find that I am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can manufacture for ourselves.  Little in the cosmic sense.  Even the greatest of the great pharos are long gone, the pyramids historical oddities being worn down by the wind, eventually to be turned into dust. Mankind itself will one day perish.  Without some interconnectedness that transcends the physical, without God, it is all pointless in the end.  Most people are able to live with that, and for them little purposes (success, money, power, effecting change, helping others) suffice.  I suppose they never  think about the cosmic scale, or are at least able to put it out of their minds.  To me, it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion.  That the true reality underneath the the physical is spirit.  That this world is a school of sorts, where we learn and grow, and our souls mature.  That gives a purpose to my little purposes, and takes some of the pressure off.  It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms if you're really just here to learn.  It's more important to progress, grow, persist, to learn to love yourself and others and to express your love, especially when it's dificult to do so.

Judge William Sessions is a disgrace but a solemn warning to those who ignore the web of evidence that our government institutions have in their contempt for our civil rights.

Ignorance of the patented status is not a defence against infringement, although it might reduce the damages a court would award.  However... unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit, almost certainly it is \\\"obvious to one skilled in the art\\\" and therefore unpatentable.  Routine engineering is not patentable; patents (in theory) cover only inventions, ideas that are genuinely new.  Caution:  I am not a lawyer.  Consulting a professional would be wise if significant amounts of money are at stake.\",\" What's the difference between the F550i and the new F550iW?

Remember the VGALIB package that comes with Linux/SLS? It will switch to VGA 320x200x256 mode *without* Xwindows. So at least it is *possible* to write a GIF viewer under Linux.

It makes me proud to be a libertarian.  It appears both conservatives and liberals prefer to cold war until you win, then nurse the enemy back to health for another go around.  It's like subsidizing the wealthy countries (Japan, Germany, etc.) with free defense, and then trade-warring with them because of the economic competition.  It's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke.  I ask myself, what law could we pass to prevent government from doing stupid, frivilous things with OUR money?  Then I think, the Constitution was supposed to do that.  Could someone please tell me what legitimate constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries?  Seriously.  Roger Collins\",\"    I disagree.  McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real- istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they still go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the game by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the NBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is  bringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are trying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect  examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being benificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals that would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to attract, that these players are indeed superstars.    It ain't nearly so simple as this.  The casual fan doesn't think about much  at all.  Can you actually find an adult with a 3 digit IQ who believes that McDonalds makes good hamburgers?    Yes but apparently the Rocket has not lived up to his marketing responsi- bilities has he?  He was hyped, initially, as a superstar, but outside of one Grey Cup game he has done very little to maintain/enhance that assess- ment of his talents.  Most Argo fans probably feel the team would be better off without him.   cordially, as always,  rm \",\" Yeah, make darn sure you cover all the glass, so the driver can't reasonably expect to be able to drive with the things on the car.  \",\" [...]   Not that I think anyone cares, but this pattern (using other examples of course) was discussed 2,000 years ago by Aristotle in _Nicomachean_Ethics_.

Here are the rates I get:  1) sequential read (MSDOS C program that uses bios calls to read 64-sector                     blocks sequentially from outside (first) track inward)                       8mhz bus    10mhz bus                      --------    ---------    MAXTOR LXT340:    860KB/sec   976KB/sec    QUANTUM LPS240:   862KB/sec   887KB/sec  2) disk buffer read (same C program, but re-reads the same block repeatedly                      so in effect is reading the RAM buffer on the drive)                       8mhz bus    10mhz bus                      --------    ---------    MAXTOR LXT340:   1046KB/sec  1212KB/sec    QUANTUM LPS240:  1015KB/sec  1276KB/sec  3) CORETEST V2.7 transfer rate (seems to agree with (2) above)                       8mhz bus    10mhz bus                      --------    ---------    MAXTOR LXT340:   1051KB/sec  1224KB/sec    QUANTUM LPS240:  1026KB/sec  1298KB/sec  I managed to get hold of the QUANTUM LPS240AT product manual and it goes into excrutiating detail describing how the bits get from the platter, through the controller, and out the IDE interface.  Nowhere do I see anything like \\\"after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host\\\" (even though I SWEAR that's whats happening ;->).  Here are some relevent quotes from the manual:    \\\"Data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of    3.75 MB/s maximum, 1.87MB/s minimum.\\\"  (My calculations show 3121KB/sec    maximum and 1578KB/sec minimum...  disk spins at 4306 RPM with 87    sectors per track on the outside and 44 on the inside)    \\\"Single burst errors of up to 24 bits within one sector can be corrected    'on-the-fly', in real time as they occur, allowing a high degree of    data integrity with no impact to the drive's performance.\\\"  (I take    this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck)    \\\"For page-mode operations, the data-transfer rate to and from the buffer    RAM is up to 10.0 MB/s. This high transfer rate allows the AT Interface    IC to communicate over the AT bus at a data-transfer rate of 5.0 MB/s,    while the DCS simultaneously controls disk-to-RAM transfers\\\"                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ So the thing can even do it's cache pre-fetch WHILE it's sending the requested sector (it has 3 64KB read buffers for pre-fetching, I guess you could call that a cache :-|).  So when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks, WHY am I getting a measly 862KB/sec when I should be getting around 3MB/sec???

You can telnet to hermes.merit.edu, but that routes you through Sprintnet, which is horrendously expensive. \",\" [stuff about changing windows registration omitted] \",\"Tcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW.  We have several Network General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on several hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy,  2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility, 4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely operated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual  manipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found  it 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for many protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle TCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily modified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems by adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.  Tcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and SunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump. It compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will need Motif 1.1 or better.  The following files are available for anonymous ftp from  ftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking  tcpview-1.0.tar.Z tcpview and tcpdump source code tcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z Sun4 binaries tcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z DEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries  What tcpview adds to tcpdump: - easier interface - enhanced protocol decoding - hex display of frame - capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt - can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name - ethernet address host table - can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames - can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional  processing.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1  New features:  Now reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r', the  file type will be automatically detected.  Can now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file.  The hex format has been changed.  New time options have been added.  Options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets.  Bugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag)  New flags: -R read Sniffer file.  Not usually needed, except for reading from stdin -ttt prints delta times -tttt prints times relative to the first frame -W write a Sniffer save file (use with -w) -x print frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.

For a review, refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 and June 1919.  Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War, and was unclassified after the war. Supposedly, the government rethought this soon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.  The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of their signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore, the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.  IF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of the man who INVENTED wireless: Tesla. Tesla confirmed that Rogers' methods were correct, while Hertzian wave theory was completely \\\"abberant\\\".  ----  ET   \\\"Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time.

-------- End of part 7 of 14 --------     \",\"    No, the argument says John has known Q, ie a codified version of the logia, and not the original, assuming that there has been one. It has weaknesses, of course, like that John might have known the original, yet rather referred to Q in his text, or that the logia were given in a codified version in the first place.   The argument alone does not allow a firm conclusion, but it fits well into the dating usually given for the gospels.       Not necessarily, Luke may have trusted the version he knew better than the version given by Matthew. Improving on Matthew would give a motive, for instance.   As far as I know, the theory that Luke has known Matthew is based on a statistical analysis of the texts.       Yep, but it will take another day or so to get the source. I hope your German is good enough. :-)       I still do not see how copies from 200 allow to change the dating of John.       Yes, but an if gives only possibilities and no evidence. The authencity of many letters is still discussed. It looks as if conclusions about them are not drawn because some pet dogmas of the churches would probably fall with them as well.       Well, rather like some newsletter of a political party reporting from the big meeting. Not necessarily wrong, but certainly bad.       Yes, but the accuracy of their tradition is another problem.\",\"I've just installed a 5.25\\\" tape backup in my C610; lot of the issues are the same.  So, to answer your questions...    You probably want to hard-wire the SCSI ID with shorting jumpers.  Put it at a convenient number like \\\"1\\\".  You *could* cut a hole in the back of the machine to route the ID switch, but why go through the hassle?  You probably won't be needing to frequently change the ID of your internal drive.   Yeah, when I first installed the tape drive I was a little concerned too.  But it's no problem, the device is designed to fit just fine with the overhang.  It shouldn't reach back beyond the ROM/RAM/VRAM SIMMs, though.   You can special-order parts to mount the device from your local Apple dealer.  The relevant parts are:    922-0358  blank bezel faceplate   922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25\\\" device mounting bracket]  Note Apple's unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to mount a 5.25\\\" device.  The service techs I talked to said, \\\"Oh sure, we stock those.\\\"  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to hold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.  As far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already cut out for a standard 5.25\\\" device.  (Why not?  They advertise these machines as being able to accept any standard device in the 5.25\\\" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for their CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use.  I'm going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my tape drive, which is a standard 5.25\\\" device.  Good luck with your SyQuest.\",\"I suspect that this clipper thing could backfire on the Gov in a big hurry. I expect that products using these chips will socket them rather than soldering them, since once the keys are handed over by the escrow agencies, the chip is so much garbage, and will need to be replaced. I expect that someone will come along with a pin compatible chip that uses secure encryption -- possibly even disguised so that it's not possible to tell it from the clipper chip until you try to use the 2 backdoor keys.     If I were to manufacture such a chip, as part of my marketing strategy, I would try to subvert one or both escrow agencies either through bribes or industrial espionage -- and then publicize the fact. (doing my best not to be connected with such activities -- which would likely not be legal :-) Publicly discrediting the escrow agencies would go quite far towards creating a market for a secure alternative.    I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip, and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread. Any back- doors or weaknesses would further discredit the scheme, and help grow the market demand for a secure alternative.   I believe that the company that provides such an alternative will make few friends in the LE community, but lots of money. I also believe that the government will do it's best to make such plug replacements illegal. I expect that they will see the same success in limiting the availability of such alternatives as they have seen in limiting the availability of certain illicit drugs -- ie. little to none.\",\"I wanted to create a postcript file with Win#.1, to print it on a laserwriter II.

Many veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that in an endemic area, they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs presenting with lameness, swollen joints, +/- fever.  A recent paper (March 1993) has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs can be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting.  This has been an ellusive matter for researchers, and is one of the fundamental requirements for many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease. Up to now, only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to \\\"prove\\\" that the disease exists.  This paper is noteworthy in two other regards:  1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The dogs had episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5 months after exposure.  After this period, none showed any further clinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  So these are proven, clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous recovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course, observations longer than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn't have the same chronicity that some see in humans.  2)  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the vaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.  Of course, they want the world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine efficacy.  Anyway, maybe we will see some independent, scientifically sound evaluations of this vaccine in the next year or so. \",\"  When someone starts criticizing the Leftists for not being Leftist enough, we get a pretty clear idea of what they believe to be normal.

I inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  I can stick it in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  I'm not fat, just have a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch to get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it still hurts.

Although some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent  irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep,  wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the puncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the  spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot, and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 \\\" apart.)  This is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.  (I have diabetes and have to take an injection every morning.)     Later,     David\",\" > And the same goes for other cultural practices.
