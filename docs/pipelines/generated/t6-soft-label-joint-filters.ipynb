Does anyone know if he's involved?   This may be the purpose for the University of Colorado people.  My guess is that the purpose for the Livermore people is to learn how to build large, inflatable space structures.   If this is true, I think it's a great idea.  Learning how to build to build structures in space in an essential step towards space development, and given that Freedom appears to be shrinking towards the vanishing point, I question whether NASA's space station is going to provide much, if any, knowledge in this area. (Especially if a design such as Faget's wingless orbiter is chosen...) If such a project also monitors ozone depletion and demonstrates creative use of (partial) private sector funding in the process -- so much the better.   And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the \\\"wild idea\\\" stage or does it have real funding?   Not yet.  Though, if this project goes through, I suppose The Return of Jeremy Rifkin is inevitable... -- _______________________________________________________________________________\",\"  First, thanks to all who replied to my original question.\",\"It's great that all these other cars can out-handle, out-corner, and out- accelerate an Integra.

On the non-pacifist side:]  (1) Killing to defend the innocent may be, if anything, _more_ justifiable than killing in self-defense.  I can turn my _own_ other cheek, but I have no right to turn someone else's.  (2) It seems to me that if Jesus had meant to teach pacifism, He would have made His position more explicit.  He didn't tell the centurion to leave the army, for instance; and the NT is full of military metaphors.  [B. On the pacifist side:]  (1) Apparently many early Christians refused to fight in the Roman army, or stated that one should refuse if given a choice.  But it's not clear whether they were objecting to war _per se_, or objecting to Roman policies.  (2) In modern warfare, it seems to be impossible to direct attacks only at combatants.  Bombing, both conventional and nuclear, kills lots of civilians.  (3) It's hard to tell whether any _particular_ war is justified at the time. Often it takes decades for the requisite information to become available to the general public.

The electronics and dynamics of the ink cartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch. On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.  The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer results in much less spread than ink drop technology.  It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than inexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printers offer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1 ppm for an ink jet printer.  Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the life of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about $US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield) cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over the life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are less than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closer between the two technologies.  Laser printers are usually desinged for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product replacement cycles.  \",\"i used to say \\\"if i were hot enough, you could fry an egg on my oily face\\\". i am now 50 yrs old and my skin looks younger (i'm told) than some people's skin at 30 (it's still oily).  i have only a very few tiny wrinkles.

INTRODUCTION      A wide variety of images, data, catalogs, information releases, and     other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net.     A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the     remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as     providing 'anonymous FTP'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on     the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP     directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via     email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com     or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions     on how to make requests.      The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames     SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.      Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is     huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.   VIEWING IMAGES      The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly     large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To     read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,     use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu     (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP     sites.      The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image     formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document     is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at     pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory     pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.   ONLINE ARCHIVES      NASA AMES      Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via     anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and     a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press     releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please     note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.      FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in     pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the     archive (the index is about 200K by itself).      To access the archives by email, send a letter to     archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the     subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:   send SPACE Index  send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.      The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in     caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use     one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this     section for images or programs.      The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image     disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The     disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are     available in these collections.      The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory     contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in     the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is     found in the IMDISP directory (see the item \\\"VIEWING IMAGES\\\" below).      The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to     contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing     specific information. It's in MISC/media.guide.      Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee     (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).       NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM      The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and     provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data     from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140     data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can     be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS     also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition,     ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to     query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors,     keywords, title words, or abstract text words.      ADS use requires direct Internet access. For more info and to sign up to     become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu.

A new national survey says drugs are easier to get, more teens are     using them and fewer deem drug use as risky.       For the last two years, government officials have trumpeted results     from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is     being won.  But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by     eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students     nationwide.      Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If     drug use dropped during the '80s, eventually some students will     have fewer \\\"drug-using contemporaries\\\" who act as examples of     substance abuse's drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,     one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths \\\"must be given     the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,\\\"     Johnston says.      This type of resurgence \\\"is possible,\\\" says Eileen Shiff, author of     \\\"Experts Advise Parents\\\" (Delta, $14.95).  But that's not the issue,     she says.  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today     could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now.      Aggravating the problem:  baby boomer parents - who experimented with     drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to     their children.  \\\"I've even seen parents serving kegs of beer\\\" to     their underage kids and friends, Shiff says.  For a recent graduation,     Shiff and other parents organized an all-night, \\\"lock-in\\\" party where     no booze or drugs were allowed.  \\\"We need to fulfill that parental     role, otherwise the peer group takes over,\\\" she says.      Officials may \\\"talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven't     done anything that I've seen,\\\" says Suzanne Linkous, Scottsdale,     Ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and     other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line.  Linkous, a     member of USA Today's Teen Panel, says \\\"there's always going to be     experimentation\\\" with drugs.      A real war on drugs could be waged \\\"education-wise,\\\" she says.  But     \\\"some don't want to give kids the facts.  They think it will give     them ideas; it's the same with birth control.  I think you should     give the kids the information or have it accessible\\\" through classes,     pamphlets and speakers, she says.      Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in     kindergarten, says Dallas Owens, 17, teen panelist from Miami Shores,     Fla.  \\\"I remember in kindergarten, I used to see (drugs).  I think     kids in the 10th and 12th grades have already made up their minds     (about using drugs),\\\" he says.      Scare tactics in public service announcements aren't working; only     one commercial has gotten it right, he says.  The commercial opens     with two \\\"good-looking girls\\\" in the restroom talking about having     no prom date.  Then they take a hit off a joint.  \\\"That hits home     because it's not attractive,\\\" he says.  \\\"You can't be doing drugs if     you want somebody to like you.\\\"       Adolescents' choices      Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:                       Estimated, per 100 students                              1991     1992   Pct. chg.

Actually it is a Goldstar, but it's essentially the same TV and electronics--just a different face plate and name.  #1.  Fortunately, TV tubes don't explode.  I'd think the TV mfrs want to make this possibility remote as possible.  If at all, they'll  *implode* and the glass that blows out would be the result of the glass boucing off the back of the tube due to the implosion. In any case, don't kick it around! :-)   #2  I fixed the TV after getting a hold of some schematics.  It turned out to be a blown 2W resistor feeding the flyback transformer.  I guess the original resistor was a bit too small to dissipate the heat it created, burning itself out.  I checked to make sure the flyback wasn't shorted or anything first!  Oh, luckily, I had a resistor handy lying around that had just the right value for what I needed.  I can't see it being more than 50 cents!.\",\"So long as we think that good things are what we *have* to do rather than what we come to *want* to do, we miss the point.

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\"   (See also Map 1.

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole   length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to   Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain   plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of   Tartar villages.

The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.  A merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri  town of Khojali (Pop. 6000) in Karabagh, Azerbaijan, is reported to  have taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military  operation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the  Armenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been  massacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten  and shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed  the Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian  insurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of the Karabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City  hospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant  were killed. Azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to  condemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its  sovereignty.  Serdar Argic\",\" Koff!

It is a '75 850-T. The tires that were on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an owners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are: Front, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and 33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi instead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.  The real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for the front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon Roadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger than that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend, and was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first motorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner tube qualities?  The above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current rear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought 100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be very good at getting close to matching mail order prices.  I am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the front and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer  lasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and FJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive behavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable back end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving much better tire milage life. Any comments?  A friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very good, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to mount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be careful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to check out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and I havn't had a chance to check the rim type.  On another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?) Vetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually I would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be fork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame mounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower bars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition runner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe' style. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is just that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)  -----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------                              edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475                              (208)323-2174   P.O.

The assignment is to come up with a product and create a marketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at this point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a \\\"full page\\\" monitor for laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed by authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook screen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember, technical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR \\\"full\\\" height.  The screen would probably be monochrome. The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and applications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We could hopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.  Now, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really need some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me via email and let me know: 1. If you would consider buying a \\\"full page\\\" laptop screen 2. How much you would be willing to pay for it 3.

(There's a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it's more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.           Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the way down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water, rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \\\"thermal  pollution\\\" de-icing a river, said, \\\"Up here, we view heat as a resource\\\".           Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is  purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than  cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.\",\" Christian anti-Semitism comes from the obvious fact that the Jews should know the Hebrew Scriptures better than anyone else, yet they did not convert to Christianity en mass, thus rejecting \\\"Christian Love.\\\" \",\"I'm sure Intel and Motorola are competing neck-and-neck for  crunch-power, but for a given clock speed, how do we rank the following (from 1st to 6th):   486  68040   386  68030   286  68020  While you're at it, where will the following fit into the list:   68060   Pentium   PowerPC  And about clock speed:  Does doubling the clock speed double the overall processor speed?

I thought I would post an article I  found in the Saturday, April 17, 1993 Toronto Star:                     'CLIPPER CHIP' to protect privacy  Politics is of course Dirty Pool, old man, and here we have a classic example: the NSA and the administration have been working on this for a *long* time, and in parallel with the announcement to us techies, we see they're hitting the press with propoganda.  It's my bet the big magazines - Byte, Scientific American, et all - will be ready to run with a pre-written government-slanted story on this in the next issue.

It would be well worth folks archiving all the discussions from here since the day of the announcement to keep all the arguments at our fingertips.

It's more likely that the Moon will never be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch,  and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat  sink capacity could offer some military utility for \\\"high ground\\\" military weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space  travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as  Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor  activity in the global scope of things.  Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to prevent calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it's too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink, and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.  We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have to deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use the easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few centuries, if not much longer.  Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument. The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for conventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from a bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little ultimate profit either.  Gary\",\"the 'Center for Policy Research' writes...        Considering all the murders of innocent Israelis at the hands      of Arab death merchants, I see nothing wrong with the advice.       As usual, the bias of the 'Center for Policy Research' echoes     through this newsgroup.  Here we have an enraged Likudnik who     is venting his spleen, and you portray it as if this is going     to become policy.  You don't say what the response to Matza's     suggestion was.  Do do not mention whether he was refering to     terrorists caught in the act, which could be a clear cut case     of self-defence.  Would you care to elaborate on this, or was     this all you wanted to say on the matter.  Why don't you give     up this 'Center for Policy Research' crap, and just post your       biases without trying to legitimize them with a pompous name?       A laudable precaution.            Every single thing you post about Israel is posted to portray     Israel as negatively as you can.  Deliberate omissions are an     integral part of the shtick.  And it's not only the incidents     that you do not mention, but even the stories you do post are     fraught with omissions, which change the entire meaning.  The     absurdity of your respectable name cannot hide your bias.      In your effort to portray Israel in an unfavorable light, you      have accomplished nothing, except to prove that a respectable      sounding label like the Center for Policy Research is nothing      but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude      against Israel and the need to vent it.  \",\" The Cold War has not ended.  The only thing that has happened is that  the two sides have exchanged roles.  The USA has a higher imprisonment rate (400 per 100,000 population) than any country in Europe by a factor of 10 or so.  In California, it is over 600 per 100,000 population.  The prison population in California is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980.  Most of these inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws.  Police now confiscate property, without trial, under a \\\"good faith probable cause\\\" standard, in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drug dealers of their ill-gotten gains.  Conduct an opinion poll, and a majority will answer \\\"yes\\\" if you ask them whether civil liberties and due process should be diluted in order to Send Our Young People The Message That We Are Serious About Winning The War On Drugs.  I don't know whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners, but I would expect the same result.  They certainly seem to vote that way.  According to Jack Herer's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_, over TWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under the marijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their own business and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselves than users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year).  Under the \\\"War on Drugs\\\" campaign of \\\"zero tolerance\\\" due process protections have eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have proliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicians who favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not only legal, but political:  \\\"My fellow Americans, we must send our young people the message that we are serious about winning the War On Murder\\\"--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun prohibition laws.  Gun owners are about to get a taste of the medicine they voted for believing it would be used only on those with different tastes in recreational drugs.  What goes around comes around. \",\"I can only comment on the Kings, but the most obvious candidate for pleasant surprise is Alex Zhitnik. He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but he's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he were more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's only a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though not through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided  to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the award goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be MVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the league's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the  rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer goals than Hartford. Honorable mentions to Majestic Marty and Warren Rychel. Jon \",\" Yes, it is -- you could look it up.  And spare us the thin-skinned indignation, please; what's sauce for four years of using George Herbert Walker Bush and J. Danforth Quayle as an insult is sauce for William Jefferson Blythe Clinton.

If so, your normal children won't have to worry too much unless they marry near relatives.

Violent solutions are passe'?  I take it you propose disarming the police, then?  Please don't mention RKBA in the same breath as the KKK.  RKBA is about being able to defend yourself and others, not about killing the innocent. Actually, your mention of the KKK is rather funny, considering that the first gun control law in the US were created specifically to disarm black people...\",\" DMorf (Dave's Morph, I think is what it means) and DTax (Dave's  TGA Assembler) are available in the MSDOS_UPLOADS directory on the wuarchive.  They are arjed and bundled with their respective xmemory versions, dmorfx.exe and dtax.exe, you can also find a version of aaplay.exe there, with which you can view files you create with dta.exe or dtax.exe.  I downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing  away the afternoons since.  The programmes are all a bit buggy and definitely not-ready-to-spread-to-the-masses, but they are very well written.   The interface is frustrating at first, but it gets easy once you figure out the tricks.  I have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morph without using the splines option.  Not sure why, since I don't have the source.  I think it was written for TP 6.0.  If anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing  to work right, tell me; it took me several hours the first time just to figure out that if I just used the durned splines then  it would work... \",\"it must have 1 meg memory and support res. 1024x768 (even higher will be better)if it has 9 & 15 pin ports and also supports ega/cga , that's better.

Let's assume a brute-force engine like that hypothesized for DES:  1 microsecond per trial, 1 million chips.  That's 10^12 trials per second, or about 38,000 years for 2^80 trials.  Well, maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond, and build a machine with 10 million chips.  Sure -- only 3.8 years for each solution.  IDEA uses 128-bit keys.  Shall I bother doing the calculations for you? Hint:  multiply 3.8 years by 2^(128-80).  And you can't do IDEA at that speed; key setup takes much too long.  I wouldn't be surprised if that were the case for Skipjack, too, though there's no way of knowing just yet.  DES used only xor because that's what was feasible with mid-70's technology.  Modern chips can do a lot more.\",\"  Is that what turns you on? The truth needs to be told over and over  again. There are Armenians who of course witnessed the Armenian genocide  of 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914-1920 but their voices of truth  are suppressed today in the hollow din of anti-Turkish/Muslim campaign by the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle of the fascist  x-Soviet Armenian Government.

It is stressed in appeal that the experience of five-years of fighting for independence from imperial chains shows a grim process . The war against Azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of  the Armenians of Ukhari (Upper) Garabag, has meant the destruction of Azeri villages and towns, occupation of 10 percent of the territory, 60 thousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place. This is all the price of fighting for liberty from Russian imperial rule, is said in the document.     Azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make every effort to inform the people of the world about the truth in Azerbaijan, and to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state.    It is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine, food, experienced doctors and financial help to settle refugees from Kelbajar, Fizuli and Lachin regions, and to render medical aid for the  sick and the wounded men.--O--   60 REFUGEES FROM KELBAJAR PERISHED IN THEIR ESCAPE LORRIES        BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today, during the evacuation from Kelbajar region, 60 refugees on board two lorries were killed in the fire from the Armenian Tanks on the only road to leave Kelbajar. According to press -service of Azerbaijan president, no one survived the tragedy. --O--   SITUATION IN THE REGION OF KELBAJAR     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attempts to evacuate the rest of 15,000 citizens, encircled on alpine villages of the region of Kelbajar  went on within the last twenty-four hours. Evacuation helicopters could not land near these villages because of shelling from the Armenian side and existence of fog. Measures are undertaken to air-drop food and medicine to the encircled people.    Several hundred people succeed within the last twenty-four hours to get out of the region of Kelbajar via mountain range. Refugees are  settled in the neighboring regions of Azerbaijan and in Ganja.  Authorities face serious problem with rendering refugees medical  aid and food. The number of refugees from Kelbajar is over 40,000 people. Azerbaijan is not capable of handling a disaster of this magnitude.--0--   ARMENIAN ARMY CONTINUES ATTACK ON FIZULI     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: The region of Fizuli of Azerbaijan,  situated outside of the territory of Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag, has been subjected to heaviest attacks of Armenian army for the fourth day. About 30 armored technique and more than 500 soldiers of the enemy are taking part in the attack.    Armenian units broke the defence line of the azeri forces and occupied the ruling height from where the town is shelled from \\\"Grad\\\" installations, this morning. There is heavy destructions in the town and more than 20 people are dead. Population of the town is hastily evacuated.--0--   PRESS-CONFERENCE OF THE CHIEF OF PRESS-SERVICE OF PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Fifty-five thousand refugees from the region of Kelbajar were taken out by 11 o'clock on April 5, informed the chief of the press-service of president of Azerbaijan, Arif Aliev, today.    Journalists were also informed at the press-conference that International Red Cross is helping to accept and render refugees medical aid. There is an urgent need to supply the refugees with tents, food and medical aid.    Arif Aliev informed that as a result of the ongoing tragedy brought on by the latest aggression of Armenia, the leadership of Azerbaijan intends to appeal to Azerbaijanis and all those who treasure human life all over the world for help.    Concerning the reaction of the international community to aggression  of Armenia, Aliev said the department of state of the USA has expressed its anxiety to leadership of Armenia.    Participants of peace efforts in Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag under CSCE, Rafaelli, Mareska and Chetin strongly blamed the aggression of  Armenia against Azerbaijan.    Leader of press-service informed that tomorrow ambassador of  Azerbaijan in Russia, Hikmet Haji-zade, will conduct a press-conference in Moscow. Detailed information on latest events in the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan will be given at the press-conference.--0--   AZERBAIJANIS PICKET IN FRONT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF RUSSIA     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Azerbaijanis, living in Moscow, picketed in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia. Picket was conducted as a token of protest against participation of Russian units in capture of the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan by Armenians. About 100 people took part in the picket, organized by Azerbaijani society \\\"Dayag\\\".--0--   PICKET OF SADVALERS IN MOSCOW     BAKU (5 APRIL) 30-40 members of \\\"Sadval\\\" society picketed before the building of permanent representation of Azerbaijan in Moscow. Picketers were demanding the return of Lezghins lands, as if annexed by Azerbaijan.    Ambassador of Azerbaijan in Moscow, Hikmet Haji-zade classified this action as provocation aimed at creating a further inter-ethnic conflict in Azerbaijan. He marked in his talk with the Turan correspondent that he does not rule out a connection between the Armenian aggression in the region of Kelbajar and this anti- azerbaijani action of the \\\"Sadval\\\" society in Moscow. He also marked that 30-40 people do not mean the Lezghian nationality in the whole.    Society of Lezghins, \\\"Sadval\\\", registered in Moscow in 1990, demands the creation of a Lezghistan state, which never existed before on the northern territories of Azerbaijan.--0--   ATTACK OF ARMENIAN UNITS STOPPED     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attack of Armenian army on the town of  Fizuli, which began in the last twenty-four hours, is stopped, informs  the press-service of the Ministry of Defence of Azerbaijan.    In the result of undertaken measures, 6 tanks and a number of  the attackers were destroyed. Advance units of the Armenian army retreated several kilometers.    Chairman of the parliament, Isa Gambar, visited the town of  Fizuli and met with commanders of the units of the national army and local citizens, today.--0--   STATEMENT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF AZERBAIJAN     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan  issued a statement in connection with aggression of Armenia in the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan.    It is stated in the statement that regular units of the armed forces of Armenia captured the town of Kelbajar on April 3 .   Attack of Armenian units, which began on March 27 deep in the territory of Azerbaijan still continues. Armenia has occupied at present 7500 sq.km of the territory of Azerbaijan.    Spreading of Armenian aggression far away from Ukhari (Upper) Garabag proves that the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflicts has entered a specially dangerous phase. This is the result of non-recognition of  Armenia as an aggressor by the international community, is marked in the document.    It is stressed in the statement that the units of the 7th Russian army are participating in the Armenian attack. This casts doubt on the sincerity of Russian mediation efforts in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict.    It is marked in conclusion that aggressive actions of Armenia  have wrecked the negotiation process under aegis of CSCE.    The document contains the appeal to the world community to stop Armenian aggression and to use political and economic sanctions against the aggressor.--0--   Serdar Argic\",\" I think your experiences under the Bulgarian regime are highly relevant. We have too many people with their heads in the sand saying it cannot happen here, as our Constitutional Rights are being trashed every day because the government justifies doing some end-run around the protections by a 'crisis' requiring 'drastic action'.   It is most likely that in the future possession of secure encryption tools will be regarded as possession of 'terrorist and drug dealers tools', and be some serious Fedaral Felony. Just like common tools are 'burgular tools' if the police say so, common computer programs (even computers themselves) are now 'hackers tools', and will become 'terrorist tools'.  BET ON IT.  The insights of someone who has lived throught this are very important. If the US goes the way of the old Soviet Union and its client states as far as individual rights, privacy and overall freedom are concerned, the rest of the world (remember 'New World Order'?) will not be far behind - only a few years.  Please keep posting anything you find that is deficient or that threatens ones rights in this thing.  For example, a conversation between a suspect and a lawyer will no longer be private from Big Brother eavesdropping.  Political dissent allready is very dangerous in this country, all it takes is the government to decide that enough people will take one seriously, then one becomes guilty of 'plotting to overthrow the government by illegal means'.  The phrase 'illegal means' is defined as whatever the government wants it to be defined as.  Couple this with Clinton's pressing for a 'smart' National ID card (an 'Internal passport'?), with the added wrinkle that anything about you and your past can be put on it, and you can only take the government's word as to what is really on it (since they will be the only ones with the means to completely read and reprogram the thing).  Isn't that nice?  While the Feds can bust into one's safe without the keys, the owner knows his safe has been broken into.  When they break into your 'secure' phone conversations (or other stored/transmitted data in the near future) you have no way of knowing, so accountability as to the legalities has gone out the window.  Just like a safe, if they have a legal cause, they can get the keys from the suspect, just like they can get the keys to a safe or the combination from the suspect.  Same with encryption: Record everything, get the warrants, THEN decode it with the keys obtained from the suspect.  This Clinton Cripple, along with its natural extensions, will make any priviliged communications between client and lawyer, and any meaningful political dissent virtually impossible.  Which is the general idea. Any propeganda about its being secure, and the safeguards, and all of that are just that - propeganda to reassure people so they will by into this monstrosity.  DON'T BE SUCKERED.  BIG BROTHER IS LISTENING!!!   \",\" Oh!

My name is clearly visible in the headers, and I sing the post with my account name. If you have a problem with that, then you will have to get over it. I've used this account name for over 10 years and the people who have been reading newsgroups for the last 7 generally recognize \\\"Hades\\\" as my account name. I have no intention of changing the way I post.       It isn't Apple's responsibility to tell its customers how to fool around with it's hardware. That is what Apple Service Techs get paid to do. I personally like the design of the Q800, and applaud Apple for coming up with a good way to make use of the front space for all of those drive bays. I like it a lot better than the 900/950 design, except for those people who need Drive Arrays. I do, however, agree with you about the LW Pro design.       Again, its's not Apple's place to make it easy for non-certified service people to fool around with Apple hardware, even if they did buy it. Of course you are free to do what you want to your Mac, just don't get upset when your Apple Service Rep tells you that your warranty is no longer valid.       This sounds like the kind of problem I had when I installed 4MB SIMMs into an LC, back before low-profile 4MB SIMMs were readily available. The standard 4MB SIMMs would contact the top of the case and make it a bit difficult to close the LC, but it did close and work just fine. One of the nice things about Logic-Boards is that they are generally quite flexible and can withstand a fair amount of pressure.\",\" Ever hear about cutting off the electricity? That was done. How effective is an electric stove then?\",\" One of the rules for a permanent swap file is that it must be contiguous (non-fragmented) space.  I suspect that is more responsible for the difference than the amount of free disk, in your case.   It depends on what you are running.  We had to increase our swap file (I think it is now 20MB) when some applications couldn't run without *everything* else closed. \",\"Archive-name: net-privacy/part3 Last-modified: 1993/3/3 Version: 2.1   NOTES on ANONYMITY on the INTERNET ==================================  Compiled by L.

Helsingius?   * * *  _____ <8.1> What are some known anonymous remailing and posting sites?    Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites   is anon.penet.fi operated by julf@penet.fi for several months, who   has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment.    Including anonymized mail, Usenet posting, and return addresses    (no encryption).  Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.     Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk   remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):   pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX   scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to   aid remailer use).    ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu   -----------------------------     Anonymized mail.  Request information from above address.        elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu   -------------------------     Experimental anonymous remailer run Karl Barrus     <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU>, with encryption to the server.  Request     information from that address.        hal@alumni.caltech.edu   ----------------------     Experimental remailer with encryption to server and return     addresses.  Request information from above address.    hh@soda.berkeley.edu   hh@cicada.berkeley.edu   hh@pmantis.berkeley.edu   ----------------------     Experimental remailer.  Include header `Request-Remailing-To'.    nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu    ----------------------     Experimental remailer allowing one level of chaining.  Run by     Chael Hall.  Request information from above address.    phantom@mead.u.washington.edu    -----------------------------     Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site     address for information.    Notes   =====      - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often     running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues     are wholly unresolved.      - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP     software (see the question on cryptography).     - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)     vary between sites.    - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are     mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.  _____ <8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?       Users   -----    - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the     seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.   - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.   - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on     Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.   - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.     Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases     network traffic.   - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this     is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'     hierarchy is preferred.   - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.     references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for     readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any     inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even     future ones under the same handle.   - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your     identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by     sending anonymized mail to yourself.   - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them.      Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.   - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.   - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.     Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.   - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large     amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating     his hardware, all for your convenience.    Operators   ---------    - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an     introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and     consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and     monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and     security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or     lassaiz-faire?   - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate     potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user     is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user     posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your     users trust you to protect them.   - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations     where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.     warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke     the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)   - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.     Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly     and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with     users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under     ``(in)stability of anonymity''.   - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?     What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is     your commitment to it?   - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an     address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item.      Consult a lawyer about your liability.   - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared     to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you     do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system     adminstrator, consult those who do and are.   - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If     possible, query group readers.   - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message     format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure     the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.   - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from     physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.    Readers   -------      - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason     that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that     equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail     anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its     volume is heavy or increasing).   - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters     will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate     responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.   - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,     harassment, extortion, etc.   - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they     offend you personally.   - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the     idea of anonymity itself.   - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings     should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or     `conceivable' need exists.    References   ----------      See e.g. ftp.eff.org:/pub/academic/anonymity:    > This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual   > privacy and the use of handles.  It accepts the need of a system   > operator to know the name of a user; but suggests that the use of   > a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a   > letter to the editor. The article concludes with a set of   > guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous.  _____ <8.3> How do I `kill' anonymous postings?    James Thomas Green <jgreen@zeus.calpoly.edu>:    > Try putting this in your kill file:   >      >   /Anon/h:j   >   /Anonymous/h:j   >    > This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that   > contain `Anon' or `Anonymous' in them.  Not perfect and won't   > kill followups.       Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask   anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so   far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common   as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.    _____ <8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?    Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for   individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is   almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion   and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack   started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was   wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)   but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided   anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up   the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous   alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through   servers like there's no tomorrow.''      Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in   researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste   <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system   from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the   server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,   and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by   multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended   advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group   support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was   arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.''    K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an   anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus   against it.     K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to   `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and   used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of   intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his   server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to   abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the   facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was   created.''    In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most   controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on   scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized   mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine   the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide   accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.      J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet   newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological   opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).   Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,   abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than   ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of   anonymity is also controversial.    For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb   1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate   crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via   anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been   posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then   non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a   New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of   vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating   through many newsgroups.       The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded   that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''   suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was   not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of   the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived   association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries   for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous   user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his   detractors.    Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal   opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news   operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire   extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the   scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is   best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users   in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a   day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized   through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due   to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to   find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.    Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to   dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste   threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate   news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages   originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to   threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several   times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it   by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5   hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the   service's administration. In response to the serious threats he   disabled global group access temporarily for one week and   encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.      Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by   ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security   weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is   currently in the process of code development and testing. He is   planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon   to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new   system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple   email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,   etc.    A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.   1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography   in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of   confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public   access account, and he had to shut it down after only several   weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately   originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the   software to the public domain.    Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on   government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and   group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the   group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,   and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable   digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in   the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to   attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing   easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and   encryption.

Cheers   Robert  (HB9NBY) \",\": Clipper Chip is a response to the fact that there is no business : or professional body in a position to establish a standard and : provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission : systems. :  : RSA might be in position to do it, if they had active cooperation of : a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones. ....... : Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this?  I, for one, : would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.   Hear hear! I completely agree that we need to work quickly to establish alternatives to the government's Clinton Clipper. As Brad Templeton and others have noted, once the Clipper becomes ensconced in enough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the *legal* standard, and it will become the \\\"market* standard as well. (There is a lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is mandated, about whether non-escrow alternatives will be allowed, etc.)  (There are also unclear issues about how hard, or how illegal, it will be to make \\\"workalikes\\\" which meet the standard but which generate phony or untappable keys...I'm sure the next several weeks will see these issues thrashed out in this and other groups.)  Meanwhile, I'd be interested to hear RSA Data Security's reaction. Often criticized in this group for their licensing policies (the usual complaints about MailSafe costing too much, at $125 or so, and the general issue of software patents...), we may find that *allying* ourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do. What's a mere licensing fee when our liberty may be at stake? (If everyone who wanted true security paid, say, $100 for a lifetime use of all of RSA's patents--which expire in the period 1998-2002, or so--then RSA would make tons of money and be happy, I'm sure. A small price to pay. For those to whom $100 sounds like too much, I'm sure the actual terms could be different, spread out over several years, whatever. To me, it's a small price to pay.)  Strong crypto means strong privacy. Escrowing keys, sending copies of keys to large databases, and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces, all done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms, is *NOT* strong crypto!  Whatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of patenting number theory applications, this minor issue pales in comparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal (note that I said \\\"potential\\\"...we'll presumably learn more in the coming months).  The RSA algorithms are at least public, have been analyzed and attacked for years, and source code is available (to better ensure no deliberate weakenesses or trapdoors).  I know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems using off-the-shelf hardware (like Soundblaster boards for the PC) and CELP-type software. The new generations of PCs, using fast 486s and Pentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption. Combined with Diffie-Hellman key exchange, this should provide an alternative to the Clipper system.  Of course, we don't really know if the Administration proposes to outlaw competing systems. (It seems to me that their goal of tapping terrorists, child pornographers, and Hilary bashers would be thwarted if low-cost alternatives to Clipper proliferated. Not to defend child pornographers or terrorists, but limiting basic freedoms to catch a few criminals is not the American way of doing things. End of soapbox mode.)  I suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had with RSA (and don't look at me....I have both MacPGP *and* a fully legal copy of \\\"MailSafe\\\"!) and instead work with them as quickly as we can.  RSA?, Jim?, are you listening?  -Tim May  P.S. I reserve the right to retract these opinions if it should turn out that RSA Data Security was involved in the Clipper proposal.\",\"Most of the key issues in the 284 line post to which I am following up are dealt with in the following post I made on talk.abortion yesterday, modified to correct the next to last paragraph.

He called them \\\"the Great Commission\\\" but this is NOT descriptive of Jesus's words in Matt. 10:15.  Matt. 10:14, Jerusalem Bible translation:   \\\"And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have  to say, as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust  from your feet.\\\"  Matt. 10:15:    \\\"I tell you solemnly, on the day of Judgment it will not    go as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with    that town.\\\"   \\\"> The above is a good description of Kaflowitz, who keeps harping on  > shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said next.\\\"    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                                ^^^^  The highlighted words refer to Matt 10:14 and 10:15 respectively.  And Dean countered:  \\\"Actually, this comment of your's is a perfect example of what an intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are, since I specifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreaty to spread the word.  In fact, it is the combination of the two statements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to characterize that as \\\"ignoring\\\" the instruction to spread the word is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are.\\\"  Of course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of \\\"instruction to spread the word.\\\"  All these quotes btw are from:  Message-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>   And I claim it correctly, because my question went:  \\\"Do you, too, measure the goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not a whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?\\\"  and the closest Dean came to an answer was:  \\\"Peter, Peter, Peter.  You're just so stupid, pretentious, dull, and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that the sport is all there is.\\\"  Of course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts in GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this, yet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:  \\\"So I now restore the answer to your question that you deleted.  If you're still unable to figure it out, ask a nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really doesn't take much sophistication to understand.\\\"  On top of which, I doubt that the \\\"answer\\\" is at all representative of Dean's true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus far are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean's  mind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken. One wonders whether Dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in all this.  He even dredges up a falsified account of events that transpired earlier on another thread:  \\\"You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ was in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the \\\"sins\\\" of other individuals.\\\" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  False.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins. That I made public announcements of the \\\"sins\\\" of others --\\\"sins\\\", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in the posts of others-- is a different matter.  Many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that they do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so I pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread, YOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.  Dean again:  \\\"You made an ass of yourself by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was somehow an attempt to \\\"paint Jews as plaster saints,\\\" thereby revealing your inability to understand the discussion as well as showing your dislike for people saying positive things about Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then claiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.\\\"  Actually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew who gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite according to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing Jewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as implicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.  I went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of the doubt in a post following my initial crack about \\\"plaster saints\\\",  suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.  In an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly distorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as the basis of one insult after another.\",\" We all know this will never happen.

This is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is, or was, taught to think. It is the fundamental premis \\\"A is not not-A\\\". If a thing is true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic  asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word \\\"believe\\\", however. The weak sense means I am not sure. \\\"I believe Tom went to  the library.\\\" (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense means I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. \\\"I believe  that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws.\\\" (despite  the fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian belief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological  topics.)    Note that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the  majority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that if Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be false, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity.  (And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)    It is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless  they have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks and wants.   Most Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living tradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly by the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.   If depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we  may both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive that he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.    Thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being  can find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find  absolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who does not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.   Here I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the knowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass  is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half full: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole point of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist and the optimist express the *same* fact.)   It is, of course, quite true that different people may express the  same belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail to understand each other's words as expressions of the same belief and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great scisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal agreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs are equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict some other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have been stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must, **necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical to say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct,  but if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as long as we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other  as in error.\",\"# # \\\"labor\\\" is a tough one.

I doubt you could even come up with anything that could be said to be universally \\\"good\\\" or \\\"bad\\\".  And when I referred to \\\"the truth\\\" I was using the term hypothetically, realizing full well that there may not even be such a thing.   True enough.  But they cannot be said to be anything more than personal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any sense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some \\\"higher authority\\\" (aka, absolute moral truth).   An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth? Interesting notion.   :-)  Certainly one can have as one's morals a belief that compromise is good.  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most people do very successfully.  I suppose one could hold compromise as being an absolute moral, but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?   Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying a commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long & healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most agressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulating production.  The equation is always more complex than presented. To characterize relative morals as merely following one's own conscience / desires is to unduly simplify it. \",\"This (frayed) thread has turned into a patented alt.atheism 5-on-1 ping-pong game, and I don't have any strong disagreement, so I'll try to stick to the one thing I don't quite follow about the argument:  It seems to me that there is a contradiction in arguing that the Bible was \\\"enlightened for its times\\\" (i.e. closer to what we would consider morally good based on our standards and past experience) on the one hand [I hope this summarizes this argument adequately], and on the other hand:   }|> }Disclaimer:  I'm speaking from the Jewish perspective, }|> }where \\\"the Bible\\\" means what many call the Old Testament, }|> }and where the interpretation is not necessarily the }|> }raw text, but instead the court cases, commentaries }|> }and traditions passed down through Jewish communities. }|>  }|> This seems the crux to me: if you judge the Bible according to a long }|> line of traditions and interpretations coming down to the current day, }|> rather than on its own merits as a cultural artifact, then of course }|> it will correspond more closely with more contemporary values. } }But if that's how the Bible is actually being used today, }shouldn't that be how we should judge it?  If most people }use scissors to cut paper, shouldn't Consumer's Reports }test scissors for paper-cutting ability, even though }scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth?  That's possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching Jewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this highly-interpreted version is what was \\\"enlightened for its times\\\". To (attempt to) extend the analogy, this is like saying that the original scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for their times, even though they only ever cut cloth, and had never even heard of paper.  I'm not arguing that the Bible is \\\"disgusting\\\", though some of the history depicted in it is, by modern standards.  However, history is full of similar abuses, and I don't think the Biblical accounts are worse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours.  On the other hand, I don't know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible shows *less* abuse than their contemporaries, or ours.  That complex and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic interpretations of that history is interesting, but I still don't think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history.\",\"Issue 5 of the X Resource (the published proceedings of the 7th Annual X Technical Conference) has an paper by Mark Linton and Chuck Price titled \\\"Building Distributed interfaces with Fresco\\\".  The summary describes Fresco (formerly known as XC++) as an X consortium effort. Without doing a complete review of the paper, I'll just mention the goals as stated in one section of the article.  the effort has the goal of providing the next generation toolkit with functionality beyond the Xt toolkit or Xlib. Features they want in FRESCO include:  lightweight Objects, such as Interviews Glyphs Structured Graphics Resolution independence Natural C++ programming interface edit-in-place embedding distributed user interface components Multithreading  This by no means captures the complete content of the paper.

The differential diagnosis between migraine and non-migranous pain is not *always* important, because some therapies are effective in both (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen).  Other therapies may be more specific: beta-blockers such as propranolol work better in migraine than tension-type headache.  The most important thing, from your perspective, is that you got relief.  Also, please understand that a diagnosis other than migraine does not necessarily mean \\\"psychogenic\\\"; I suspect that organic factors play as large a role in tension-type headache as in migraine.\",\"  (Deletion)   Yes, sorry. I have got that wrong. My apology.     (Deletion)     So? No fun, but I must have met the minority then. And \\\"given by god\\\" refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something.     Rob, I am not intimate with Jewish theology, but I understand that you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god views, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute evil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.     (Deletion)   The context was metaphysics, even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent, the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion. I wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system.     (Deletion)   Is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds. The context is repulsive, and it is foul play, IMO, to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book.     (Big deletion)   No, not the interpretation of some laws, but the interpretation of the bible. As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue with god. The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo- logic question) is proof of a theology used.       It is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection between the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of it, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better. You might answer that one can't becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but that holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place? Can't it be replaced somehow? Is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other message that is included as well?     (Deletion)   Sorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system.   (Deletion)   If we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?     And the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it can be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way, and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god.\",\"Looking for PostScript or Tex version of a paper called:  \\\"PUBLIC-KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY\\\"  Written by:  James Nechvatal  Security Technology Group  National Computer Systems Laboratory  National Institute of Standards and Technology  Gaithersburg, MD 20899   December 1990  The version I obtained is plain text and all symbolic character formatting has been lost. \",\"   I think you are suffering from some alignment or color table or <whatever> problems, if a Color Classic is as fast as a Quadra rendering to screen.

There is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction, but I did not subscribe to that view.  God may choose one individual over another as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not preclude that the development of that individual into what he is in this earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.  I do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view of an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that befalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater law in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the ultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of Christ can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that was completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the flesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental concepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized and mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus Christ to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc. Their teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the continuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism). More important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body, the ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate resurrection and judgement on the Last Day.  There is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the tenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind. Clearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma or that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a new impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not refute the disciples' question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of course, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only one of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man himself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his parents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at all indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of Christ's answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.  There is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John the Baptist,     \\\"If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come.\\\"  This also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching either way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to the human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did not push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (\\\"If you care to accept it\\\").  So I took care to point out, not that the Bible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and that much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes understandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I pointedly used \\\"repeated earth lives\\\" to distinguish a little from the oriental doctrines usually associated with the word \\\"reincarnation\\\". The phrase is Rudolf Steiner's (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too that the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely free from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the most important expression of it being Lessing's \\\"The Education of the Human Race\\\".  To return to your original point, Paul's statement about Jacob and Esau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma. And both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the incarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus Christ, in my view.\",\"and and  about Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola and what they can teach us.

After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were intermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining 5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.  Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems. Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I then insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the IIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me another RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see the drive there's a definite hardware problem.  Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send me a *new* one, but they said \\\"no.\\\" Also, within three weeks after I purchased my original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.  I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these facts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again reinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data recovery.)  It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new.   I feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La Cie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful. But c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent a letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even  have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)  What's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy any other products from La Cie in the future.  Bill Krauthammer f2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu\",\"  I'm not sure about that.

Unless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys from men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations in which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex (due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least some sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the children from abuse by members of the *same* sex.  If we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest that if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a practical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations in which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse them. By working together \\\"with good will on both sides\\\", we may be able to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.  Mr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for personal attacks on Mr. Cramer.

Afterwards, we sat down to discuss prices.  I explained that I wanted a car just like the one I drove, but in a different color.  He said he could get one exactly like I wanted from the dealer network within a day.  We then negotiated a price and signed the deal.  Next day, I get a call.  He explains that they goofed, and they had neglected to take into account a price increase. (The last price increase had occurred over 4 months prior to my visit.)  If I still wanted the car, I would have to fork over another $700.  As an alternative, they would honor the price if I bought the car I test drove (which had been sitting around for  6 months and had a few miles on it). I said goodbye.  This was a good example of how they can lowball you and still cover their butts.  It's too bad more people don't demand honesty or these types of dealers would no longer be in business.    The next dealership I went to was straightforward and honest.  First thing the salesman said was, \\\"Lets's see what you have for dealer cost and work out how much profit I should make.\\\"  The deal went through with no problems.\",\"I have posted disp135.zip to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities   ******   You may distribute this program freely for non-commercial use          if no fee is gained. ******   There is no warranty.

When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this       menu you can press any function key except F5. If you move or copy       files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like       'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory. +       The header line in 'read' menu includes \\\"(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)\\\". +         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.       pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use         for reading current file.       pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This         program will automatically determine which format this file is.         The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check         standard extension. Still fail, report error.       pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.         If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key           (except ESCAPE).         If any error occurs, program will make a beep.         ESCAPE to terminate.       pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.       pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.     2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.       Within this menu F5 is turn on. You can do special effect on image.       pressing RETURN: show image.         in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text         mode.       pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do         special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.       pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.       pressing SPACE: save current image to file.         B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).         Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).         Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).         True Color: save as 24-bit image.          This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image         to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program         will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another         directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after         pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change         directory to what you want. Then,          pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.         pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename                       (filename under bar).     3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.    4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,      the performance is poor.    5. If you want to save 8 bits image :        try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...       If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):        try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster        (No one is better for true 24bits image)    6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.    7. Not all subroutines are fully tested    8. This document is not well written.

He is only insurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcher is injured during a game.     So to free up this roster spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever, why not invoke a catcher re-substitution rule:  If the last roster catcher on a team is injured during a game, the team is permitted to substitute in his place for defensive purposes a catcher who has previously been yanked from the game.

Being a PhD-student at David Chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.  The report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be retrieved from  ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)  from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA. The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.  ==================================================================== ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the representation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier systems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in both computation and communication complexity than any such system proposed previously.    Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability. Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the Diffie-Hellman problem.     Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in previously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the first place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender after the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user, which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems. Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by a simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that previous solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system can be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while retaining its computational efficiency. ====================================================================  Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!    I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as possible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to me and I will try to reply as good as I can.

By biblical scholar I mean an expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the chips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be defined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are not trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).  Why an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly out of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere  in his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which  it lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.  Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about the Josephus insert, your \\\"proof\\\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated here.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \\\"prove\\\" nothing.  Scholars speak of the \\\"weight of evidence.\\\"  Far more independent evidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your belief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass faith off as fact.  As for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring inconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect?  Shouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel  Fictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for  Herb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share  an evolutionary ancestry).  The fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny your position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \\\"prove\\\" your faith.  Independent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already discussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith.  Moreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted to \\\"prove\\\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than saying \\\"I am right because I say so.\\\"    Your logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian  General Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where \\\"fundamentalist\\\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1) Jesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily resurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the clincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe \\\"inerrant\\\" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the first four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant bible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to  contain the first four.    Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!  Its faith, Bill.  You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else.  Whatever works for you.  Just don't foist it on others.

Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois. ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.  The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king, who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which  the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million, His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual, seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of slots.  The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions supporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from  70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside). According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and  the Pacific Rim.   RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money. Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began  negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in  Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time. Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way that people operate.  For example \\\"everybody can sell you everything.\\\"   Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.  Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who  went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually, he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the  Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to  allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.  The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied  Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in  Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners :-)  Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is  apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them  specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1 million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their  satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They  have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place now.  Tidbits:  *  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big business because big business is just like what they have over there, except that \\\"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\\\"  *  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months.  *  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia, and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.  *  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried partly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying monolith.  Italy gets a new government \\\"every two weeks\\\" but we don't worry  because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.  *  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting 25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \\\"equivalent\\\" value in  rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government.  *  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western  satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites, which was rather reassuring.  *  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much  shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the  difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition, shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date hardware. \",\"Well, this is my second try at posting on this subject.

I assumed that heresy meant a departure from orthodoxy, in which case generally accepted belief is indeed an important issue.  In this case, the definition of the word \\\"create\\\" is of great importance, since creation is the issue being discussed.     I should have said \\\"given the Mormon belief.\\\"  If you disagree with the Mormon belief that creation is more a function of organization of eternally existent substance than one of ex nihilo creation, then that is the important point.     Correction: you interpret the Bible to mean something very specific by such terms.     It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume to tell Mormons what they believe.  Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and Lucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or organized or whatever) by Him.  We also believe that being \\\"offspring\\\" of God has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually \\\"born again\\\" of Him.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.  This is how language works, Robert, and it's why making someone an offender for a word is dangerous.   <...>     On the contrary, Robert, it is not a red herring at all to show that those who rely wholly on the Bible cannot seem to agree on what it says.  You say that one must simply \\\"look at the Bible\\\" to see what it teaches, but centuries of people doing just that have sho0wn that no one is really sure what it says. Are we to believe that you are the only one who really understands the scriptures?     Let me clarify this one more time.  You did not refer to the Mormon belief that Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie's belief in same.  We keep trying to point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not the source of Mormon doctrine, and you keep ignoring it. (see below)     On the contrary, Robert, if you are quoting McConkie's words as Mormon canon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of *great* importance.  The fact is that they are not.  Whether or not they indicate general Mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interviewing a large number of Mormons.\",\":Is erythromycin effective in treating pneumonia? : :-fm   Not only is it effective, it is in fact the drug of choice for uncomplicated cases of community-acquired penumonia. \",\"  Yeah, me.

A columnist for the St.  Paul \\\"Pioneer Press\\\" wrote an article giving the \\\"inside scoop\\\" on the  issue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible  candiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic  Center (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty  confident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will  ultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other  two sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the  inter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name)  believes that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also,  because of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed  until (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.   However, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed,  because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for  conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to  this mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future  viability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even  further.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of  knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging  Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met,  which may happen.  Regarding possible candidates, the three teams are  Hartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \\\" Ice Demons?\\\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't  been announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the  Target Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in  as many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see  Hartford and Tampa show up there either. So, Minnesota may end up  getting another team, but it may take a few years.     Go Sabres!\",\"I would like to sell the following sci-fi books at Best Offer.

Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by  performing studies that are \\\"blind\\\" in various ways.  Some of these are:    o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a       placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the      control group or the test group.    o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects       receive a placebo or the test treatment.    o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects      receive a placebo or the test treatment.  Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to  differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis is quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on which it is based so that others can verify it.    It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because those who performed the study did not \\\"blind\\\" themselves.  It is not considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already are, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested, the control and test groups are treated alike.\",\" The test isn't whether GM knew--otherwise that would reward GM for its stupidity.

The result, which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the end of the period.  That was their argument to prove that you don't go wrong buying the Ford Taurus over the Camry.   Now, if I remember correctly, the Camry costs about $4000 or so more in initial costs.  Essentially, it means that you spend about $4000 extra on repairs on the Taurus.  That is ridiculous.  Every time your car needs repairs, it is extra hassles, loss of time and a dozen other things. I would much rather spend $5000 more in initial costs than spend $4000 more in repair costs. \",\" I'm afraid he isn't.  They are a hypocritical lot.  \",\" I agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result in 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400% does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning by .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus, before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is.   The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a player who gets an out gets a \\\"negative probability\\\" in most cases. Thus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes, they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also, the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given them a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.       No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score  in the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The offence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If I am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth.           No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look, if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers, fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \\\"negative chance\\\" that the team would win.   From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda. At first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really does not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens. So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to player performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15% on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%. I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.  How do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's, etc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched in closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more valuble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better  pitcher?  They were probably about the same.\",\"Joe,   your description sounds like one of the  gravity probe  spacecraft ideas.\",\"To go one step further, you could write Roland Slabon, Pres. of the Vintage BMW Motorcycle Owners Ltd at P.O. box 67, Exeter, New Hampshire  03833 and he'll send you copy of the bimonthly rag with info as to where to send your $12 bucks if ya want to join.

But did it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920,  the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated  in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin? By the way, you still haven't corrected yourself. During World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]  \\\"Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)  when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it   becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon  method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary.

Serdar Argic\",\" I have been following this thread and figured I'd throw in my two cents...  The Amiga Zorro II bus is comparable with the ISA bus (7.16 vs 8.33 MHZ). The Amiga has had a pre-emptative multi-tasking  OS since '85 and can operate with 1 MB RAM!  SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.  A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data and moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate even better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape units.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be what I am doing while reading this group.  Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which, thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to completely get rid of IDE. --   Wayne Summer        //        AMIGA - Simply the Best.   Palm Bay, FL.

Currently I have   8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.   both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking   of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know   that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I   can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about   $400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,   the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that   the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather   avoid...  So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work   well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about   $90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how   do they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the   extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the   ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so   probably all of this is just wishful thinking...

You lurkers can join in at any time, you know!  Ahhh.. Talk.politics.guns -- the kindler, gentler newsgroup.  Who would have thought?    I remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5' a reasonable space limitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to those nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at what distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the endangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility of being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and draw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user. Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault rifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has only range and acurracy going for it.    I disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this is not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change quite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians intent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.    That seems to be the case already, given that heavy weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low numbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks, whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.    I had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers of a select group, and the like would exercise control over the heavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman tank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders from the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large, though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should therefore be jointly maintained and operated.    This I'll agree with to a point.  The State having control over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state to have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that the ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise, I would have to assume that State control would rest on the authority of the Governor and militia officers.    I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons, fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few people with government support.  Just as you argued above that the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry. I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.    We have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble. I'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their armory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in. I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.    So would I, but the resources often aren't available to outfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to call in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster than anything else.    Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up field pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton trucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff of a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units in Iowa are currently fielding in some units.   Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy equipment under State control, with little but numbers and light stuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local ranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly, hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally, the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for other responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a very minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias for these functions.\",\"While one may question the motives of the Arabs who sold land to Jews, often while publicly criticizing the sale of land to Jews, it was the Jews and not the Arabs who were taken advantage of, as the prices the Jews paid for barren land was many times the price fertile land was being sold for in the United States at the same time.\",\" I agree that some specialties have gotten way out of line.

This may be a dangerous thing to do.  It is my opinion that most educated or well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government. This should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough time will tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was  created for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line. That and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented press portrays a group of people as \\\"nuts\\\" or crazies, a violation of those people's civil rights seem justified.   Since we, as American's, have the  gurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the 2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk  voted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with domocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.   Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore the  official press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat to public safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information. So far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very agency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to their advantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If they were portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justification what so ever of doing what they did.    So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny, may mislead the public from the truth of the matter.  Just as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Dalton leads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's (in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to be unconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least). And since, I believe the only reason ATF was involved in this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to  find out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA. It would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly unconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement).    **************************************************************************** The above opinions are mine and mine only.

I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master.    In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives  when performing diagnostics.    There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way  interface connector. They have the following functions and are described  in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper  described nearest the 40 way interface connector.  LK2: LED       When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the      interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An      external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with      the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will      be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130      Ohms ot 220 Ohms.  LK1: Dual Drives      This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single      bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,      indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.  LK4: Master      When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If      there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be      jumpered in this way.  LK5: IOChRdy      When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is       fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher      data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per      second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally       fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per      second.     There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s) may be jumpered:       Master, single drive with LED on interface  LK2 & LK4 fitted.      Master, single drive without LED on interface LK4 only fitted.      Master, dual drive without LED on interface LK4 & LK1 fitted.      Slave, dual drive without LED on interface  No jumpers fitted.      Master, dual drive with LED on interface  LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.      Slave, dual drive with LED on interface  LK2 only fitted.     The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.     The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way  connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the  drive for this LED driver.

GB> I hope you meant \\\"inarguably\\\".  Given the choice, I would rather argue <g>.  No arguments about migranous aura; in fact, current best evidence is that aura is intrinsicially neuronal (a la spreading depression of Leao) rather than vascular (something causing vasoconstriction and secondary neuronal ischemia).  Migraine without aura, however, is a fuzzier issue.  There do not seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The Copenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF studies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura, but like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.  From one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in the absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From another (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of the specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache, therefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.  Whether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling headaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic colleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients they can get.  Working on a salary, however, I would rather not fill my office with patients holding their heads in pain.\",\"Dave Winfield's name does not go           In terms of PEAK, and I repeat PEAK years, Winfield has Done it   all. He has batted in the 340's for a season, drove in 100 and more runs   many times in a row before his injury. Consistently hit at or near 300   while knocking in 35 home runs. Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfield's   slugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. I still think that   dave was one of the BETTER of all time, but obviously not the best. He was   one of the best athletes evr to play baseball. He hit line drives that hit   the scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new   Stadium. Heck, only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence   since it has been remodeled. He could field, had a bullet arm, and his   hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields, and barry bonds   of last season. He is older now, and slowing down, takes more of an   uppercut to lift the ball out of the park, but he will always be my hero,   and my idol. There is nothing that could make me happier than George   inviting Dave back to the Bronx to play his last year of ball with the   Yankees. Of course, he will most likely refuse the offer, but who knows?   For 3 million dollars, he'll play. Heck they are giving gallego 2.5   million this year, having Dave as their DH, while leaving him time to play   the field when Tartabull is injured, or Nokes and mass are traded, should   give the Yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age   of Yankee domination. \",\"The following is posted for a friend.

AA and other 12-step abuse- recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.  Unfortunately, as evidence for God, this can be dismissed by stating that the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes  people 'religious', and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that being religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict, but still maintain that both are escapism.  (And I suspect that there are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to Christianity.)  I think that an essential problem with communication between Christ- ians and atheists is that as Christians we necessarily see ourselves as incomplete, and needing God (the 'God-shaped hole'), while atheists necessarily see themselves as self-sufficient.  If the atheists are right, Christians are guilty of being morally weak, and too cowardly to stand up for themselves; if the Christians are right, the atheists are guilty of considerable arrogance.  (I use the term atheist to refer to a person who has a definite conviction that there is no God, as opposed to one who does not know and/or does not care about God.) == Seanna Watson   Bell-Northern Research,       | Pray that at the end of living, (seanna@bnr.ca) Ottawa, Ontario, Canada       | Of philosophies and creeds,                                               | God will find his people busy Opinion, what opinions?

Have you ever asked a physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog? The answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind person cannot.   I acknowledge, as a Christian, that I am blind.  I see, but I see  illusions as well as reality.  (Watched TV lately?) I hear, but I hear lies as well as truth.  (Listen to your  radio or read a newspaper.)  Remember, all that tastes well is not healthy.  So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, and taste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not. That is God.   Of course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses, how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or a lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must force ourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves us enough to share it with us, even when it defies what we think we know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us  enough to help us through this world?   I also do trust my experiences to some extent.  When I do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience,  because it is what my Father commands me to do, and I see the results in the long term, I find that He has led me in the proper direction, even though it did not feel right at the time.  This is where our works as Christians are important:  As exercises of the body make the body strong, excercises of faith make the faith strong.     As for you, no one can \\\"convert\\\" you.  You must choose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever to follow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share with you the love we have received from God.  If you reject that, we have to accept your decision, although we always keep the offer open to you.  If you really want to find out why we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try praying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians about their experiences personally.  Then you may grow to understand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the logic of this world.

These are described by the inventor as exploiting the second-order perturbations in a three body system.  The probe was launched into this region for the earth-moon-sun system, where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow down. The idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without expending fuel, we'll just find the trajectory that makes it possible\\\".

The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise, since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time.  In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable. Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings, say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses the body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver. If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde, it is actually relatively non-toxic. \",\" The Partition button in Apple's HD Setup lets you set up A/UX and other types of partitions.

Some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they  were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for \\\"numbers\\\" (though  secretly afraid of them). Others steered clear of such puzzle books because  they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern  mathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't  know how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were  no exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a  specialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \\\"I willingly confess that  any time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was a hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of  my friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route --constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid  using algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it's a fact that is  well known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates,  nor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers (nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It  seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade  teachers.\\\"  Now, I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the  bookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to  recommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most  fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a  relatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to Venus and back.

Naive and wise at the same time, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these  problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian  architecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is  now Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant  letters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of  Komitas, or the paintings of Saryan.  An edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a  bibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions of Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh  Century (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).  The abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way  of life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and  worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years  the book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in  Armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just anyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk  Father Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has  brought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the  general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable  problem book.    Vardapet Anania of Shirak   Once fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no   philosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering   it the mother of all wisdom.      --Anania of Shirak  Among ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because  of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his  work. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and Solutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation of scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and Armenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last work was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia,  Movses of Khoren).  In his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:   I, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our  Armenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately,   in the expression of the psalmist, \\\"every day I illuminated the   eyes of my mind.\\\" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,  I came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy,   the mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia   neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the   sciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man   named Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me  that in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,  Christosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But          soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but          only of certain fragmentary facts.   I then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me:   \\\"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the   coast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full   of wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature.\\\" I asked   them how they knew this. They answered: \\\"We saw ourselves that many   people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man.   Indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,  Philagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become   pupils of Tyukhik.\\\" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to   God, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.   I went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I   He sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St.   Gregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself   lived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there.\\\"   Vardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with   me. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated   the science of number, and with such success that my fellow students  at the king's court began to envy me.   I spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not   been translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable   collection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan,   books on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why   enumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did   not have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating  that when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into   Armenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the   translation read as if the work were written in that language   originally.   Tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had   learned the Armenian language. \\\"When I was young,\\\" he said, \\\"I lived   in Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and   for a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I   served as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and   literature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was   wounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to   the Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: \\\"If You prolong my life,   I shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to   collecting treasures of knowledge.\\\" And the Lord heard my prayers.   After I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria   and Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher   from Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned   to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\\\"   After some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for   him, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to   assume the teacher's position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to   God not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because  of his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study   with him.   And I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from   him this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our   country, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God's   help, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me   for my efforts.      Problems and Solutions   A half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed  on verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper;   one forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and   forty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many   copies were printed in all.      --Imitation of Anania of Shirak  A Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\\\"books have their own fate\\\"). The fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The manuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because, according to  Armenian historians, \\\"in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded  from invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children.\\\" Biding their time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of  ancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts). And its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two  manuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction  and commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited,  annotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a  member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).  In the translator's words, the problems of Anania are \\\"amusing, full of life,  and simple.\\\" Orbeli goes on to say: \\\"The subjects of the problems are  generally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland  Shirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are  named, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a  contemporary of Anania.\\\" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used  only \\\"aliquots\\\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is necessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to  represent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).  Like any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the  retelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their  full glory. So let's open Anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages.  Problems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D.  572.  Problem 1  My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the  Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary  heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops.  The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time,  pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third  time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were  still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from  this remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.  Problem 8  During the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak Kamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the Persian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a  day. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent  riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in  a day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.  Problem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian  translation, they are all called \\\"dishes.\\\" But in the original Armenian,  according to Orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are  called mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian  word, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before  Anania's Problems and Solutions.  Problem 18  There was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the  metal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from one fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten  drams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.  Several of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in  Anania's time -- for instance, problem 7.  Problem 7  Once I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank  of the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast.  We caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped out of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found  forty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.  The temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I'll restrain myself and offer you just one more.  Problem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that  inhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no mention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according  to the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of  Shirak offers evidence to the contrary .  Problem 20  The hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik,  was at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild donkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and,  running to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with his brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild  beasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by  arrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were  caught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And  so, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.    \\\"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli\\\"   His biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a   bibliography.     -- K Uzbashyan, Academician      Iosef Abgarovich Orbeli  Anyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the  solution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation  of Anania of Shirak's Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages, has probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders,  and the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great  attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for  a degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma  attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An  advertisement at the end of the book reads: \\\"This book was typeset in  December 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by  me, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with  borders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project  to the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.\\\"  Typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned  orientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage  Museum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had  already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis  Academiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its  rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish  the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian  churches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve  the unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G. Strolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the  blockade of Leningrad in World War II.)  When Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times  were hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania was for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the  printer's craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the  Academy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion of Russian academic typography.     Back to Earth   This book by definition does not exhaust all the most important   works in this domain. The editor hopes that those who are guilty   of this incompleteness will read these lines and, stung by shame,   will work up, if not a collection like this, at least a monograph.     --V.

Perhaps by then there will be more than n copies of his timeless Problems and Solutions. And  we can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by  Iosef Orbeli.

This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason to believe it still goes on.  Read this:  From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992  PUBLICATION BAN          The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many         years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were         sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of         their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever         being made public.  By Baruch Me'iri  All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way or another: \\\"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published\\\".  The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest, and later on their imprisonment.  In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of this country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison, for security offenses, in complete secrecy.  In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA] affair -- we heard about \\\"the third man\\\" being in prison.  But many years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former Communist countries.  But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.  The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:  \\\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner\\\", asserts MK Zucker.  On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \\\"There is absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public.  \\\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\\\"  Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question.  \\\"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret\\\", wrote Zucker.  The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that, \\\"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter\\\".  \\\"The Union is aware\\\", says Shiffman, \\\"of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.  \\\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy...\\\"  Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible.  \\\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it.\\\"  -- Do you find this situation acceptable?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand, though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least are aware of his imprisonment.\\\"  -- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the discretion of the court?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which they can misuse.\\\"  -- And what if there really is a security issue?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.  Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public.\\\"  Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  \\\"A healthy situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security\\\".  A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir.  \\\"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.  \\\"Nevertheless\\\", adds Shtendal, \\\"the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned. The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\\\"  Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \\\"As a rule, clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances.\\\"\",\"See subject. An opportunity for sales-people (-persons? -entities?).

Three questions come to mid real quick for something like this.  Q: Which version of Adobe PS will we clone?  Aside from the level 1 and level 2 issues, Adobe has in the past released  new code that incorporates modifications/upgrades/fixes just as all other  software vendors do. The level 2 stuff may seem sound now, but I assure  you,changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to  dwindle in the face of competition. This allows them to shift people to  maintenance, as well as design efforts for level 3.  Q: Do we duplicate the bugs, or do we make it work correctly?  From the LaserWriter to the LaserJet 4 there have been bugs. (If I had  a number to call at HP or Adobe, they'ld have heard from me.) Deciding  which approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate.  Q: Do we follow the Red Book, or do we follow someone's implementation?  Without a doubt, there are differences between the Red Book and Adobe's  PS. With level 2 many issues have been refined but the Red Book does  leave big, big holes in the implementation specific stuff. It would be  nice it the Red Bood at least pined things down enough so that two  different implementations of Adobe's PS don't do the exact opposite given  an identical set of conditions.  Q: PSCRIPT.DRV?  Having done a lot of PS clone testing myself, the unfortunate side of  testing is the limited number of sources for test files. The primary  source we use is Genoa. And having characterizes their 1992 PS ATS files,  (1300+ of them) over half are taken from PSCRIPT.DRV. It may not ideal,  but the ATS files are what the printer vendors use. I'm sure that Adobe  uses them too, but Adobe's output is by definition correct, even if its  wrong.  Yes, there are some very poor clones. We've seen them here at Rastek (a sub of Genicom which has its own clone called GeniScript). Some are poor for lack of design, some are poor because they followed the Red Book, and some are poor because the vendors don't know what PS is.\",\"It's my understanding that, when you format a magneto-optical disc, (1) the formatting software installs a driver on the disc, (2) if you insert the disc in a different drive, then this driver is loaded into the computer's memory and then controls the drive, and (3) if this driver is incompatible with the drive, then the disc can not be mounted and/or properly read/written Is that correct?\",\"I need to know the following information about the upcoming Crypto Conference; The address to submit articles, and the number of copies needed.

I am as concerned about the media's complicity in this growing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the investigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from any other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been behind it.  What's going on here?  Let's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next. I'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops because I've found some of the techniques to be useful in business negotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR knows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a psychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had professionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior was emminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from civilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their isolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religious orientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as the apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being consumed in the apocalypse.  IMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated psy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of action designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly appearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the tanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations. They KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles, obstensibly to perform \\\"gas insertions\\\" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push him over the edge.  Look at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TV earlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblical role of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno on Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning) claimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true they KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they were pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and reasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at the first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and would have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the \\\"gas insertion\\\" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image that will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back and forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.  Let's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without bloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency interested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation of life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.  The way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back, abandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the armor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited his ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A simple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell how he whipped the US government would have been something he could not have resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the compound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the FBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the revenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.

It's one of those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression. What Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I'm sure, is that when people read this they think violent arguments where one member of the family grabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation which could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or a tragic accident, especially involving a child.         Unfortunately, that's not the way things stack up.  The majority of that 43 \\\"times\\\" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone  intentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill  themselves.  And why it's popular to try and blame suicides on guns, the evidence doesn't support this.  Internal studies, as well as comparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural factors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not. (Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There people jump off buildings.)         According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime is commited by \\\"non-strangers,\\\" which mistakenly has been generalized regarding the King County study to mean, \\\"Friends and family.\\\"  That is, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on the mental image that a \\\"Friend, family member, or child,\\\" equates to a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of anger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives, children assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by  someone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun was used against a \\\"friend\\\" or family member doesn't mean they weren't trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among poor urban families, and those are also the areas most \\\"at risk\\\" for family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may not be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban kid might.         Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the only value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I worked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly self-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses. Between the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there's an enormous amount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers. As such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid means of determining the success of such a defense, since according to the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report defenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders killed.         Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a \\\"friend or family member\\\" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense which occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in businesses.)          I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can't comment.  I will point out Canada's and Japan's suicide rate as indications that culture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.         There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what it's worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural lines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the exact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws  would not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate. \",\"  Exactly.

Later on, the Andersons tried to shed their reputation as creators of some of the worst pseudo-scientific shows in TV history by flying \\\"Into Infinity.\\\" This was a one-off thing done as part of BBC's \\\"educational SF\\\" series \\\"The Day After Tomorrow.\\\" The Anderson episode dealt with a spaceship capable of reaching the speed of light (\\\"lightship Altares\\\"), the four-man crew eventually  journeyed into a black hole and ended up on the far side of the galaxy (I think).

He stressed how likely it was the the Branch Davidians would commit mass suicide.  He was concerned with the safety of the children.   What did the FBI do to defuse the situation,  Did they try to reassure Koresh?  DId the FBI offer medical assistance to the BD?  Did the FBI offer them a supply of water when the BD pump stoped working?  Did the permit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound?   What the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible. They kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off their electrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their ears with loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and kept limiting their permitter.  The stated goal was to put pressure on David Koresh.   Was the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hoping to get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack the the tanks.   It appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh over the edge.  The blame for the deaths should be shared by both the federal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the fools at the ATF who planed the raid.   Stupidity and incompetence of the BATF and the FBI leadership have resulted in the needless death of 90 innocent people.   If every thing had gone as planned 90 people would be alive today. Instead the ATF screwed up and caused the death of 90+.

Of course, I said \\\"No problem\\\" and went to work. Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during  installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit  Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted  with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if  I could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition  was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn't think you could go over a 32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried  to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I am  unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I  kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS  installations).

In virtually all major revolutions including England (the Puritan revolution), France, Russia and China, the  revolutions occurred as economies were undergoing substantial long term  growth and poverty was declining.  What sets off revolutions is massive inequality coupled with a perception on the part of those at the bottom that social change is possible.  If \\\"poverty (were) the main engine of social instability,\\\" this typical historical pattern would not hold.  In fact, revolutions would have been far more typical before the nineteenth century than since that time.

Otherwise, they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix.   An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always   available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community, however, I'm not   really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting   (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches, C library or compiler patches come   out, people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for   all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license.   Hence, Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.

The system boots up if the Seagate MFM controller is removed from the system. The Future Domain card reports finding the Tandberg 3660 on the SCSI bus. The system then of course stops booting because my MFM hard disks can't be found.  The system hangs if all three (Tandberg, Future Domain TMC-1660 & Seagate MFM controller) are in the system.   Looks like there is some conflict between the Seagate and Future Domain card. But the funny thing is that it only hangs if the Tandberg is connected.  I have checked that there are no conflict in BIOS addresses, IRQ & I/O port. Have I missed anything?  I am lost here. Any suggestions are most welcomed. Thanks in advance.  Delman.    -- ______________________________________________________________________\",\" No one else seems to know, so I'll post this.  This topic came up on sci.physics.fusion shortly after the cold-fusion flap started.  As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice. They showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as hydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman constant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out of kilter, and you get sick and die.  I've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real life.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this book, I would imagine you would have to:  1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy    water.  2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other    molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.  During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and eventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the water the victim ingested was heavy.  You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both alarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly begin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real story here.  Come to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was no longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.  The most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids would literally be \\\"heavy\\\".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and heavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by about 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that the victim's urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test involving the specific gravity of a body fluid?

If you plan on paying for the car with a credit card, check and see if your card automatically covers rental cars.  Also, your own auto insurance may cover rental cars also.  Most rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent, and require you to initial in several spots if you don't want it.  The credit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort of coverage that the rental agency is trying to sell.

EDT               THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that  Octavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today  about why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to  get a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature  of learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of  people like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of  those who are here.                I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education  and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my  good friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and  all of the business and local community leaders from the city and  county and state level from around America who are here.               This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved  hearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is  their future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A  year and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because  I was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our  country, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had  too little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines  of income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to  take us into the future.                I entered with the hope that together we could create  more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of  our people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of  America's community, knowing that together we could always to more  than we could individually and that we might secure our future.              All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000  jobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the  commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here,  and those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs  does, and the successes of all the young people like those on this  stage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all  those things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're  on the right track.              Last July when I was traveling across America's  heartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in  Louisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business  people who were participating in the Louisville Education and  Employment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.   I saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed  both in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my  own state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about  -- that for millions of American young people it is really an  impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good  workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what  is learning.              In the world in which we are living, the average young  person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a  lifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning  world much better.  And we must determine that all of our young  people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased  here today.                Whether you're in business or in government or in  education, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to  building a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all  of our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things  are pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best  thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have  jobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)                They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty  good education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that  they'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either  political or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great  challenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to  fully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work  for them to do.              All the European countries have higher unemployment  rates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the  unemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.   They're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its  most rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that  I have proposed to create jobs.               In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now  about as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.   It costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of  pressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing  their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their  people.                But it is especially important for America for two  reasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move  aggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be  competitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is,  even if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed  of the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to  work in this country.  (Applause.)              We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some  of it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and  moving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We  have now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big  organizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they  are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working  at some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to  create jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the  chance to work.                It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare  reform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of  months -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the  end of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.   (Applause.)              So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of  the American people to perform without regard to race or income or  the circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that  there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their  talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.   I do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if  you want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more  responsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this  country that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you  have got to have opportunity in that mix.               A part of our vision for America has to be a future for  every young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules  and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be  something at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are  basically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners,  recognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of  our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their  background.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's  something there for them to do?        The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an  integral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of  work and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people  first, and it does have a partnership between the public and private  sector.              I said when I addressed the United States Congress in  February on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000  extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the  American business community to meet that target so that we can create   more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been  created before.              Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And  Jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in  this room and around the country -- people who are going to do more  than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people  a work experience.  And it is terribly important.              I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is  part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the  American people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their  jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving  the transition from school to work for young people who don't go to  college but do need at least two years of post-high school training  either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting,  so that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more  people to go on to college who do want to go.              All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive  plan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The  emergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would  create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and  that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It  would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work  force in jobs that otherwise will not be created.               It also will help a lot of cities and counties to  invest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level -- projects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects,  new industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities  -- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve  the environment.                The summer jobs program is an important part of that  because we have tried for the first time, through the work of the  Labor Department and the Education Department and through reaching  out to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer  jobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to  hopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young  people into further educational opportunities and to further job  opportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component  to these summer jobs -- something that the United States government  has never fully emphasized before.                A lot of these young people, as you well know, because  they come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in  difficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building  their basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other  areas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who  have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what  they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next  year.                What we are trying to do here is to give people the  opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning  skills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next  couple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school  in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning  environment.                There will be more applied academics, more opportunities  for people to learn and work during the school year, so that this  will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will  be a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new  work experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.              The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make- work jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding  the job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help  to build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve  local problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public  buildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in  hospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers,  and learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while  they earn, but letting them earn.              You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people  who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should  do this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the  opportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing  in going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't  exactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare  system; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people  to work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the  use of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if  you're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to  reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.   (Applause.)              The young people we propose to put to work under our  program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math,  reading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will  stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a  sense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge,  but a challenge that will take them into a different life.              So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even  as I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the  summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll  see whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer  academically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved  ahead.  I suspect that they will.                This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I  will be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn  from you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next  summer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school  year, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that  we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so  that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private  investments as well.               We want to honor the companies and the communities, the  business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this  summer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business  who have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who  haven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about  this event today, I want to implore other private employers to  stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this  summer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when  we don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort  them to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)              When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up  here on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking  about work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've  done to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very  foolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand  and sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had  ever had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be  worth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)              That does not mean young people should not be  entrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation  ahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and  worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.   And I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some  people say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)                I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I  grew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul  without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a  job.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to  people is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a  job and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now  I live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any  more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're  working longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.   And we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these  young people want.              Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:   It doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration  pursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private  sector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn  how to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created  in this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done  off-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a  third or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do  economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of  America's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just  kidding.                On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy  country in the world, including the United States, is having  difficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done  I'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole  deliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the  answers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.   (Applause.)              And so the jobs program that I have presented to  Congress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the  counties, through the Community Development Program, with the  infrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an  attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the  economy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little  boost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a  million jobs and maybe get the engine going again.              Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in  the private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government  money.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American  economy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind  of system we have and it works pretty well.                But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you  here today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends  and neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers  to make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the  funds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government  should create this summer, so that together we can have this  partnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a  future -- a future that our young people can believe in.                We need to send them a message that here in America if  you study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute  something to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.   You can build a future from you own dreams.               That has always been the promise of America.  Together  that's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of  the promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise  has been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.              Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\",\" No brains and he can't spell either.  .edu??

I've been thinking about this, and if this chip/scheme is to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange, either using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme like Diffie-Hellman.  If there's an out-of-band transmission of a shared session key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping?  If the phone company or some other online central authority generates a session key and sends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble of having some complicated key-depositories?  Just ask the phone company for a copy of the session key for each call.      Now, it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of every public key used by anyone anywhere, right?  So, probably, there will be some way of getting these keys verified.  This might be a digitally- signed (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit, stored by this unit.  It might also be an online directory with access to everyone's public keys.  (This would introduce another weakness to the security of the scheme, of course.)  Presumably, if you don't use your designated key, you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips.      It might be useful to have a modified chip, which would allow you to use either the original public/private key pair, or some other key pair and verification scheme.  Unfortunately, this would not allow you to call most people and establish secure communications....\",\"Pens-6 NJ Devils-6  FIRST PERIOD: SCORING: 1, Pittsburgh, Daniels(Needham, Tippett)4:14. 2, NJ Devils, C.

Thanks,  Wesley Stuart Jones\",\"I'm a system and network admin. One of my users has a Duo 230 ([*]specifications below) that has been having slowdown problems. Leaving the Duo on for several hours causes it to slow down unacceptably. It can take 10-15 seconds to change applications. During this time it is completely hung.  If he reboots, the problem goes away (For a while). It seems the system is getting itself into a wedged configuration.  He's re-installed System 7.1 and rebuilt the desktop. Neither of these have helped.   It's possible that it's network-related, he uses Eudora which checks his email every 10 minutes (over Ethernet). He hasn't checked to see if this problem occurs while undocked (he's docked most of the time).   Little to no non-Apple inits, I don't want to start yanking the rest unless I know that might *really* be the problem.   He hasn't tried zapping the PRAM, I have advised him to do that next.

This summarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300 participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in Seville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).  OLYMPUS has been particularly useful : -      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of        new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small        antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested        data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,        distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few        examples.  -      in opening the door to new telecommunications services        which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-        frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over        Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.  -      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS        received for the first time in Europe, over several months,        high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and        then distributed it to various centres in Europe.  When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the world's largest telecommunications satellite; and no other satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.  OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some of the world's largest businesses. Access to the satellite is given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or services; over the past four years some 200 companies and organisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over 100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning organisation.    As the new technologies and services tested by these OLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then make use of operational satellites such as those of EUTELSAT.\",\"   There is no notion of heliocentric, or even galacticentric either.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\",\" I just bought a BJ-200 printer a couple of days ago.

If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this, then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase, most noticeably in lower rpm range torque. Splitfires didn't do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMC pickup (4.3l V6) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley Sportster 1200 and my best friend's 1986 Sportster 883. Folks I know who've tried them in 1340 Evo motors can't tell any performance boost over plain plugs (which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers are pretty much the same shape, just different sizes). Two of my friends who have shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead, I'd dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense (plus they look really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head)\",\" How about contaminants on the corn, e.g. aflatoxin???   \",\"Hi.

Some new drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data writes. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some* track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of boosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.  I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when digitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.

It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize() should never be called more than once.  This helped.  However, I am still having some problems.  Below is a new little test program that more closely models my real program.  In the actual program, I am writing a library, callable from any other program.  This means that the first time the lib function is called, it must initialize things, and after that, it should just use the old stuff (still around because of static variables).  In the demo below, main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents the interface to the library function.  #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include <Xm/PushB.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h>  void bla(XtAppContext app, Widget top) {         Widget topone = top;  // in real prog, these are member vars         XtAppContext theapp = app; // of a class         int junk = 0;         Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, &junk,                                         NULL);          Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(\\\"blaaa\\\", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,                         topone,                         XmNheight, 50,                         XmNwidth, 50,                         NULL);          XtRealizeWidget(topone);         for (int i=0;i<=25;i++) // real prog returns when \\\"Exit\\\" button clicked         {                 XEvent event;                 XtAppNextEvent(theapp, &event);                 XtDispatchEvent(&event);         }         XtDestroyWidget(box);         XtCloseDisplay(dis); }  // SetItUp - should be called once only void SetItUp(XtAppContext *app, Widget *top) {         int junk = 0;         (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app, \\\"test\\\", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,                 NULL, NULL, 0); }  // doit - some library function callable from the outside void doit() {         static XtAppContext app; // use these every time called         static Widget top;          static int setup = 0;          if (!setup)         {                 SetItUp(&app, &top);                 setup = 1;         }         bla(app, top); }  // main - program which links to my library main() {         for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)         {                 doit();                 printf(\\\"sleeping...\\\\n\\\");//widget still on screen at this point                 sleep(5);         } }   The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created.

However, both Minnesota and Wisconsin stuck out, solely on the basis of their politics.  Both have  always translated to extremely liberal and progressive states.

Maintaining a `just  friends' level of relationship is much easier said than done.  People  usually end up getting hurt.  This is especially likely to happen when  they start off with feelings of attraction.    When people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement.   I've had the experience of going quickly from believing that I shouldn't  date non-Christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to  believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each  other.  When the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to  their original state.    This is an especially extreme case because I was young and away from home  and fellowship.  I don't think it would work exactly this way for most  people.

Thanks!\",\" No.  No.  NOOO!!!  The ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if you're grounded in some other way at the same time.    The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly  measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.    They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere, repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things like sub-panels.)  What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact, depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.  There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and news.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) and you should probably read it before asking any more questions.

The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots  of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now  defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.  The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the  SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they  were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.  About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once  in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as  Christ.  Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young  adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over  the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.  They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of  weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US  government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were  putting themselves in a self defense position.    In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn' t have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.  If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the  local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.

If I say that I am a great swimmer but I never go swimming, am I really a swimmer? and will people believe that I am? Likewise if I say I'm a Christian but I never talk to God, am I really a Christian? My faith is demonstrated by my action. The fact that we talk to God proves we have faith. Satan believes in God but does not follow Him!

In 1943, this battalion  had grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of Dro  (the butcher) who is the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5  million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council  was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was  recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily  formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the  principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the  Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination  of the Jews.

I don't know what a \\\"low grade\\\" fusion reactor is, but the major problem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion reactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some fractions, but still very small).  Massive amounts of regolith would have to be processed.  This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon as a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn't content with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust, average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound. This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.  On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; \\\"high-Ti\\\" basalts (Apollo 11 and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but... terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in titanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and sometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are *enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the world (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If even 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2 at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti basalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being mined today).\",\"Don't knock Vaughn for being a spring training .400 hitter but a .250 regular season hitter.

The pain started back up a little bit for the first time in quite a while, and I used ice and medicine again.  Can anybody explain why this particular activity, which does not seem to stress me very much generally, should cause this shoulder problem?  Thanks.\",\"  I'm no mustang head, but don't the early ones have a simple strut suspension (that is, with no upper A-arm)?  Just a strut going down to a lower control arm (single bushing: not an A-arm), with a tension/compression rod locating it in the forward/backward direction?   Anyway, simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using shorter springs, cutting the springs, lowering the spring perch or shortening the strut below the perch.  In each of these cases, the suspension geometry will suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the intended angle.  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom of the strut (roughly the height of the reduction) will restore the suspension geometry.  IMHO, the kit that includes the spacer is the only way to go...  --Ken\",\"Keith Hanlan, on the Wed, 14 Apr 1993 19:20:14 GMT wibbled: : >If I remember correctly, the reason that BMW's come with those expensive, : >and relatively worthless, short lived Varda batteries, is 'cause BMW owns : >a controling interest in that battery Manufacturer.                   : What's wrong with the BMW battery?

As I posted before, we import billions upon billions of raw ores across the Mexican border.  Not only that but ships come in and out of U.S. harbors every day full stuff.  And customs doesn't even have the extra advantage of being able to sniff them out.           I'd be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would be worth more than a shipload of raw ore, *and* you're virtually guaranteed to get it past customs, because they'd have to hand search every hold of every ship which came through.         It's not simply a matter of how much money are they worth, but how much *more* money are they worth than other goods, based on the likelihood of being caught.  Less money than drugs, but also a safer thing to smuggle. \",\"Hi!

The primary reason, and the essence of the details that you are seeking, is that the Grahm-Rudman budget controls were working.  In fact, they were working so well that unless the feds did something, they were going to have to start cutting pork. So Bush and the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replaced Grahm-Rudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush \\\"consented\\\" to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending increases.  As it turned out, the taxes killed the Reagan expansion and the caps on spending increases were dispelled by Clinton in his first act as President (so that he could create his own new plan with more tax increases).  The result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level  ABOVE where it was when Reagan left office.\",\"  In this case would the switch control voltages be -7V to turn the switch off and >0V to turn the switch on?\",\" The answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer without doing a lot of autopsies.  The second question is something that's been known for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quitting smoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the person who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in the interim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Still rather low overall, but significant.  Personally, I'd be more concerned about heart disease secondary to smoking -- it's much more common, and even a small increase in risk is significant there. \",\" The Wall Street Journal had an article on how the police were whining about all the new guns; excuse me, but police are EMPLOYEES of the government.

The catalog description is as follows:   The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager   that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a  professional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two  counter-rotating \\\"thumbs\\\" that move in one-inch orbits --  releasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.   Pressure Point Massager    A2623   $109  To order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or fax at 1-800-345-4021.  ******** NOTE: When I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price was $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was   QUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it, and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it looks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a reason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could  use the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old  one.  VERY reasonable people. ********  I have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I  would be described as \\\"structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches  and exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.   If, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough time, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus,  more prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require  physical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit  to get the prescription for p.t.    The tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache (sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my  physical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles  in particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the  headache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to  while it is being massaged.  I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing someone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my  neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in  the past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient  p.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up  in the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.  I have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base unit is about a 14\\\" x 9\\\" rectangle, about 3-3/4\\\" high, with handles on each side, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal \\\"thumbs\\\" are about  1-1/2\\\" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2\\\" above the base.  The thumbs  are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more  toward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in  either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side  of the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either side.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.                    _______________________________                 |  __    _______________    __  |                 | |  |  |  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |  \\\\^^/   \\\\^^/  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |                 | |  |  |  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |                 | |__|      |__| |                 |_______________________________|   For the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if  laying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or  neck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or standing, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are also impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and I  don't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works  well for me.  For my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager behind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or not so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.   If I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches  whenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use  than the commonly used \\\"home-made\\\" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together  (with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and  move the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than  nothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are  not in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don't  pin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like this  is to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multiple  considerations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with it.  Not only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion  for my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my neck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard against it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a few days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.   After that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point,  the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.   I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the  most vulnerable point for me.  It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades, although, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at a time) to really work it out.  I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I cannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've had it such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also  to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this  was very timely  for me.  This is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been in business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and, while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones I've seen such as \\\"Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog\\\" or \\\"Mature Wisdom\\\". I'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no big surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs,  particularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.

There are verifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments abusing gun-control restrictions.  I don't think it is paranoid to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused in thye future.  After so many times of getting burned any sane person will stop putting his hand on the stove.          I'd love to.  But as long as the politicians grab power to sell pork back to their constituents, there's not a lot I can do.           It's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trust the government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed to do it, then we should change governments.  Down that road lies total government power.   I've never been a fan of totalitarianism.          This is very likely.          The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many people would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they're here.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is necessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should have always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don't. Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more magical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more heavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument.          No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S., two-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suicide rates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about half the per-car death rate.         The problem's been humans since before we had stone axes.  The fct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody, whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally irrelevent.        Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderous impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.        Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even if we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.           In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms. (50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per  se, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's countries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've got more knives or fists.           In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S. have been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms of prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they are doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is  violent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The *vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of 99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that you can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.          The situation is not \\\"good\\\" in that people fear for their lives. But recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots, protecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they, too, lost their livelihoods?          The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn't. However, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can be appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition won't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.         You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  If you're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully simply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough, as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)          45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun. That accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans. Firearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the group *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.         You may take that for what it's worth. \",\"I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly, (motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only \\\"real solution\\\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both  legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the \\\"internal nerves\\\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd  always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that \\\"force\\\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.  Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\",\" My least favorite last line of a post.

Where do they come  #from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from #whatever is societally mandated.  It's only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily very crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what is necessary to keep that society going  - and often it's a little over-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different thing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble), but is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating meat may be perfectly legal.  # #>#Merely a question for the basis of morality #># #>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_. #># #>#1)Who is society # #>Depends on the society. # #Doesn't help.  Is the point irrelevant?  No.  Often the answer is \\\"we are\\\".  But if society is those who make the rules, that's a different question.  If society is who should make the rules, that's yet another.  I don't claim to have the answers, either, but I don't think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things about the US system, at least in principle.  # #>#2)How do \\\"they\\\" define what is acceptable? # #>Depends. #On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).  Well, ideally they don't, but if they must they should do it by consensus, IMO. # #>#3)How do we keep from a \\\"whatever is legal is what is \\\"moral\\\" \\\"position? # #>By adopting a default position that people's moral decisions #>are none of society's business, # #So how can we put people in jail? How can we condemn other societies?  Because sometimes that's necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when it is, and equally importantly, when it isn't.  # and only interfering when it's truly #>necessary. # #Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?  IMO, it isn't often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various kinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive  the right to interfere is a difficult question - it's a sort of liar's paradox: \\\"force is necessary for freedom\\\".   One possible justification is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if their own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise if we don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom. # #  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem #>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem #>to agree that some level of interference is necessary. # #They see the need for a \\\"justice\\\" system.

In the era of the Original 6, four teams made the playoffs.  To win the Cup, a team had to win two seven-game series - in other words it took 8 playoff wins to win the Cup.  The octopus (8 legs) has become a common Detroit symbol.  Every year around playoff time people start sneaking octopus (octopi?) into the Joe Louis Arena and throwing them onto the ice.\",\"So far Simmons looks like a total idiot.   1) Zane Smith should learn how to \\\"switchpitch\\\" and return from the DL. I would rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.  2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an impressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's reputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the AL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he pitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.  3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently. BUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters. Merced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at the plate in his rookie year.  4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that Walk desrved his contract.  5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I can't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through waivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught. Not a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught should have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed pitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to trade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere wasn't very fit last year.  6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!! 7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the season. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other than the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks, Patterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have pitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money on Patterson in stead.  8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.  9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke. 10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his value has increased immensely.  11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount. Let's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better. Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better than a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.  12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay. 13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The RF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace two of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a very respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have a respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options for the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was getting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.  14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave. they will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed. Now, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots, nothing else will.  On a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2 starts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of the season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the season, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked in the second half of the last 2 seasons)> \",\"My god, hope we don't have to put up with this kind of junk all season!

Since they aren't fixed in position on their stainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different position. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of contact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the ball, not the center cylindrical area.  I've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but needs to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our office's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one could still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might help.  I would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If you can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl  alcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free.  If you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see if it is actually causing the axle to spin.   If all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-( It could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be necessary.

Generally, these telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, for example, we have the following set regarding children:   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to   the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum   [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem   families and received as servants when they are left alone through   the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect   all such children in your province and send them to the places of   deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to   the people.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [1]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the   time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their   lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.      Minister of the Interior,       Talaat\\\" [2]   \\\"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.    November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the   orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their   places of exile.        Abdullahad Nuri. [3]    \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been   opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is   done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt   of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or   any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it   purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as   detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received   into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish   special orphanages for them.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat.\\\" [4]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.     Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures   to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with   the caravans.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [5]   \\\"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.    At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows   of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is   not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by   Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble   in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned   out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of   deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent   away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [6]  In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \\\"rationalizing\\\" this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:   \\\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for   its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks   it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I   shall die for it.\\\" [7]   These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never questioned these \\\"death march orders\\\" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.  For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.  If one were to examine the sample \\\"authentic text\\\" provided in the Turkish  Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it  too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the  Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or  Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery.   Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul, Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide  architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a  heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.  This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian.     - - - references - - -  [1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60  [2] ibid, page 60  [3] ibid, page 60  [4] ibid, page 61  [5] ibid, page 61  [6] ibid, page 62  [7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and     London), 1926, page 387  \",\" Henry, I made the assumption that he who gets there firstest with the mostest wins.

I wanna do some teleoperated prospecting while I'm up there...   \",\"Two developments have brought these type of activities back to the forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a 20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from the Mir Space Station.  While this \\\"Banner\\\" reflector was blank, NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner reflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space- based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV commercial, as filmed from the Mir.    The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga booster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the \\\"Environmental Billboard\\\".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the \\\"Environmental Billboard\\\" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to 804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area, deployed by the inflatable 'frame'.    To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry \\\"ozone reading sensors\\\" to \\\"continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's delicate protective ozone layer,\\\" according to Mike Lawson, head of SMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. According to IMI, \\\"as the biodegradable material burns, it will release ozone-building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer.\\\" The remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns up and \\\"adds to the ozone supply.\\\"    This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several millions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI estimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who watched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost $600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.    But back to Brian's questions:        See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my estimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus $10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon someone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.     And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use of launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think the legal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer, and no, I don't really like the idea of this additional light pollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the space advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an idiot?)    (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a low enough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just after dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the time of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still be a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)     As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There were about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga advertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for only a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious funding for this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.       And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be my guest.

That would make most people happy, and with some sort of verification procedure before key exchange, the \\\"official\\\" chips would only work with other \\\"official\\\" chips.  In other words, secrecy of SK makes \\\"physically identical clone versions\\\" impossible;  secrecy of the algorithm shouldn't be necessary.  Of course, revealing the algorithm opens them up to attacks on SK --- since all units share this key, compromising it may be a big deal. Personally, I wouldn't feel too comfortable knowing that one \\\"secret\\\" 80-bit number held in many places was all that guaranteed my security. Of course, compromise of SK doesn't necessarily mean that the system is compromised, but it's impossible to tell whether or not that's true with a secret algorithm.  Incidentally, what's to keep a \\\"secret algorithm\\\" from using the secret SK as the main key, with UK being only marginally important.

Oh well, as least it looks ok now. Still, it may not save your head as well as before you dropped it.  Mike\",\"     I don't doubt that this will be the attitude of many corporate leaders. It's understandable--most corporate execs don't know much about cryptology, and it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil.  And, the proposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what exists now.      The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have to concern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSA has put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs, probably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the existence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say) a DES keysearch machine.      As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination could acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since it would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked jodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency or organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak- nesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for (say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the complaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars to build a keysearch machine for.)      How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of the GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?  How about home phones of major execs and important engineers and designers? \\\"Gee, Mr Jones, I understand you've had some financial problems lately. Maybe I can help...\\\"        Indeed, if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likely as secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However, the system as a whole isn't resistant to \\\"practical cryptanalysis.\\\"  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes how several NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despite security measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.

The bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type, so to put a (I assume complicated) sophisticated bomb together from instructions _over the phone_ (!) one must need some brains I would expect.    I read this in an article in \\\"The Australian Muslim Times\\\", the newspaper (weekly) of the Australian Muslim community.    If this is true, perhaps one of the Muslims based in North America (if they see this posting) can elaborate.       I don't deny this fact.  The thrust of my argument here is that   (a) Salameh is, according to US law, innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law.  As his guilt has not been established, it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.  (b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps have not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important  distinction.  I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say \\\"Muslim\\\".  In general, anyone who calls themselves a \\\"Muslim\\\" and does not do or  outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam is considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to Islam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a Muslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential principles, though, then one does leave Islam.  The term \\\"Muslim\\\" is to be contrasted with \\\"Mu'min\\\", which means \\\"true believer\\\".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is something known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you will not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism, because it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I, for example, am a \\\"true believer\\\" or not.  For example, I could just be putting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to what I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say \\\"Muslims\\\" we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in practice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By \\\"Muslim\\\" we do not necessarily mean \\\"Mu'min\\\", or \\\"true believer\\\" in Islam.\",\"I have heard of two packages for the PC that support X-Win.

If it's the latter, then they won't be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files, there aren't many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTime movies, perhaps?)  As long as the region isn't being stored on disk and transferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it doesn't matter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure.

Don't Quadras use the 53C96?  If so, the Mac has nothing to do with the SCSI timing.  That's all handled by the chip.  About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs the clock registers wrong on the 96.  That, however, should only really hurt synchronous transfer, which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager.  Furthermore, disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a Quadra. On Macs that used the 5380, which is a much lower level SCSI chip, the Mac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred.  Blind mode affected how the Mac handled that handshake.

Getting published in these newsletters is hardly something to aspire to. :-)  I can't really argue with your logic, though I think you may be extrapolating a bit recklessly from what appears to be a sample size of one. Even if what you say about this local Pittsburgh guy is true, it is not logical or fair to conclude that this is true of all doctors who treat Lyme disease.  By your logic, I could conclude that all of the physicians who consult for insurance companies and make money by denying benefits to Lyme patients are doing it for the money, rather than because they believe they are encouraging good medicine. I have no idea how sincere these guys are, but their motives are as suspect as the physicians you excoriate for what you believe to be indiscriminate treatment.

The magazine article's contents are copyrighted, and may not be reproduced, translated, etc., without the copyright holder's permission.  However, this does not cover the *ideas* expressed, only the form of expression.  Copying their circuit diagram or PC-board pattern is copyright infringement.  But it's unlikely that they could stretch copyright far enough to claim that the circuit design itself is copyrighted.  So long as you draw your own diagrams and lay out your own boards, copyright shouldn't be an issue.  Patents are different.  The author does *not* have to give you any warning that the design is covered by patent (although it would be sensible for him to do so).  In fact, it's possible that *he* was infringing on someone else's patent without realizing it.  Ignorance of the patented status is not a defence against infringement, although it might reduce the damages a court would award.  However... unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit, almost certainly it is \\\"obvious to one skilled in the art\\\" and therefore unpatentable.  Routine engineering is not patentable; patents (in theory) cover only inventions, ideas that are genuinely new.  Caution:  I am not a lawyer.

I trust you don't deny that Islamic teaching has \\\"something to do\\\" with the fatwa against Rushdie?\",\"  Well, despite what my mother told me about accepting dares, here goes.   You have to be very careful about what you mean by \\\"question authority\\\". Taken literally, it is nonsense. That which is authoratative is authoratative, and to say \\\"I question to word of this authority\\\" is ridiculous. If it is  open to question, it isn't an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectly reasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrase here should be \\\"authenticate authority.\\\" Once you have authenticated your authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as an authority.   The difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You  can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency in what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of discourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, in inself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and  other that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.) I cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings,  because if I can independantly verify its teachings, I don't need an  authority. I need an authority only when there is information I need which I cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I must do it by some means other than by examining its teachings.   In practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don't have time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientist woring today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts of knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to  verify for himself.  In spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source  ofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I am a Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seem the strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter for belief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).  The atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is a reasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty. If you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of every receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possibly change. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific.   To demand scintific or rational proof of God's existence, is to deny God's existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very nature, prove anything.   \",\"   And have Jesse Jackson picket the stadium?\",\"The motif mailing list will now be located at lobo.gsfc.nasa.gov  If you would like to be added (or deleted) from this list, please send mail to motif-request@lobo.gsfc.nasa.gov to mail to the list, send mail to motif@lobo.gsfc.nasa.gov   Brian\",\"   More info please.

Perhaps would it be interesting to find an answer to these questions ?    shorter or longer ?     First question: When will the LawEnforcmentField be transmitted, and how does the remote Clipper Chip handle it? Is it transmitted periodically in the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does the phone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever, or tries it to turn them into voice-output ? (Which would not be disturbing)    Second question: Why!?!? Why is such a strange procedure used, and not a real RNG ? This turns those S1,S2 in a kind of bottleneck for system- security.    So no (technical) provision will be taken to place a 'timeout' on these warrants? This would be a unique possibility to realize such a technical restriction, by letting the escrow-agencies perform the decoding of the session key. Just take modem-lines instead of secure fax. Is this such a bad idea ?    Wow! (How does the randomizer work?) Are the SHA (and Key exchange) secret, or publicly known ? Key-Exchange is DH, I guess ?

After all, when you grab under his chin and are careful to keep your hands away from his twisting head, what is he going to do -- tailwag you to death? I even had one occasion where I was unexpectedly jumped by a 130 lb. German Shepherd and grabbed his upper jaw in one hand and his lower jaw in the other. Now I'm holding his mouth open (no way is he strong enough to clamp down) and he can do nothing.  HOWEVER, all this macho shit aside, the fact is that when you are riding a bike and a dog is arrowing to intercept, it may be unwise for you to stop and try to deal with the dog, for the simple fact that it might be through your leathers and working on your jeans before you can dismount and deal with it properly.  By all means, if you do kick the dog or otherwise get its attention, STOP and STAY there. If you kick the dog and ride away, that is a victory for the dog -- it drove you out of its territory. It is not even a qualified victory, it is a victory. If you kick it and STOP, and sit there, 99% of dogs will say, \\\"Oh, shit! This guy's serious!\\\" and back off.

It may not use the exact words as quoted above but I'm sure many will agree that the same message is being issued.  Later on when I get back home I will try to find the precise section(s) but you can do the research for now (I hope).  I also realize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_ *to the Western media only* but he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact intentions on this issue.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_ still stands as the \\\"Bible\\\" (so to speak) of the mainstream Palestinian National movement!    As a staunch pro-Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT influenced my opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As I mentioned above, just a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar conclusion on the Palestinian National movement (the PLO in most cases).  BB does not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share my views.   What 1948 situation?  A negative situation I presume?  Is this the same \\\"situation\\\" when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the Jews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM?  Was this an example of Qu'ranic law being exercised?  If not, I have another suggested reading for you... get into the \\\"soc.culture.arabic\\\" newsgroup where the posters have been debating the topic \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" (and may I remind you the people doing the debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran). You will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran (to put it lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will be treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran?  I think the 1948-1967 \\\"situation\\\" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you think?   All I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" and think again.  \\\"Freedom of choice\\\" is *definitely* not an option in Qu'ranic law especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I'm sure you saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic state).   Probably nothing!  Aside from how to break the news to his Palestinian brethren that the _Covenant_ is \\\"null and void\\\" without getting assassinated himself!   In conclusion, Ahmed, you should go to the library and find the _Palestinian National Covenant (1964)_ and read it VERY CAREFULLY.  By the way, Redpath Library DOES have it in stock because that is exactly where I found it when I was doing my research.

Finally, the 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up,  became warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I took a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride. They had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours before I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom -- surrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.  Today was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes, 50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat Touring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot. Some sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one MSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on the back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that Cycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like a big moto party.  After about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime, and another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/ pray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the parking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from  the Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else into the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the  ST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of the road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a bicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.  Well I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could  think was \\\"big\\\".  Then I put one foot up.  \\\"Heavy\\\" came to mind very quickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to  tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.  By 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even on bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that  did not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is on a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north of the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95 splits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access highway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton,  Manchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester. On its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about 30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many thoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.  Cindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along in top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane  changes were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this  thing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the fairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was non-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless. Smooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of, but it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless buzz.  The jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the brakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius, decreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.   The section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok in this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack oft featured in \\\"Spencer for Hire\\\" -- a place where you could really  find \\\"Spencer\\\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting through traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.  About half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal for \\\"hold on tight\\\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second gear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a  short shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light traffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new. Well, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort lane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went  until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed there.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering,  I looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.  Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \\\"get off in a mile\\\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted to re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were several manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the  slow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could  see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed to thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad out front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put the thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side stand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.   My demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable, hardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than  list, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.\",\"Well, I looked at the scoring plan I had, and have decided to modify it.

Separately, Itar-Tass news agency said Armenian forces had halted their latest offensive which has swallowed up one-tenth of Azerbaijan and sent tensions in the Transcaucasian region soaring.  The journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan, head of the Armenian defence ministry press centre, as saying Ankara had been sending  planes up to 15 times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops.  It looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey about the impermissibility of such actions,\\\" the journalists quoted Duliyan as  saying.  \\\"If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate measures. We have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraft units.\\\"  Turkey, which shares a border with Armenia, has supported Azerbaijan in the conflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in which more than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988.  The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane to Azerbaijan containing humanitarian aid.  A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directly on a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocket launchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey.  Duliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops and arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan, from where they were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku.  \\\"All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the country which is affording military assistance over our airspace,\\\" he said.  Armenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops  involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself.  Tass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensive along the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front.  \\\"The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent inspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's) leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire,\\\" the agency said.  Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire in Karabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit of Commonwealth leaders.  \\\"The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the protection of the Karabakh population,\\\" Tass quoted him as saying.       At least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have collapsed.  \\\"The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the legal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh,\\\" he said. The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not  been recognised by any other country.  Armenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in future peace talks, something Azerbaijan rejects.  Local news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister Iskender Gamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with Armenia, had resigned.  Turan news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office. Khabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of Baku, police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev. There was no official confirmation.  \",\" This is a very good point.  AT&T obviously knew and participated in the development of the Clipper chip.  This amounts to unfair business practice and gives AT&T an early monopoly on the market [hopefully a non-existant market]. Other companies that compete with AT&T in the cellular market (Motorola, NEC, etc) have grounds to file a complaint over this.   It would seem that the one fact that the government has overlooked in this whole fiasco is the economic standpoint.  As others have mentioned, the most difficulty the Clipper chip faces is an economic one.  Let's face it, the average consumer doesn't care or know that the Clipper is a bad idea.  If there is a perceived need for cellular encryption, then the companies will provide one.  Most likely, a standard will emerge.  But if the Clipper is too expensive (and $25 a chip is way too much) then they will develope their own or buy a cheaper one.  I give SCT my full support, and hope the Clipper chip goes the way of the Beta video tape format.  Also hope they get sued over re-using the name Clipper.  --   ---------------------------------------Cyberspace:--------------------------\",\"Hello,  I am looking to slightly increase the performance of my 89 Honda Civic Si.

First the scriptural quotations:  This sort of reasoning is such that if you beleive you are justified, if not then your beleif is in vain, so you might as well beleive.  Most of these quotations are of people who do beleive.  People who would try to justify their own positions.  Second the logical proof:    The period of time that has elapsed from the event growing larger does not increase the odds that a hoax would be discovered.  In fact the longer a hoax is perpetuated the stronger it becomes.  Finally:  There is no proof of the resurrection of Christ, except in our spirits communion with his, and the Father's.  It is a matter of FAITH, belief without logical proof.

This is very typical of the elitist Liberal attitude that The People  are incapable of thinking for themselves.  This elitist attitude will be the eventual undoing of the arrogant liberal tide sweeping America, as The People begin to realize more and more that they are being treated like errant children and robbed of their freedoms by a bunch of Utopian arrogent socialist jerks.         Although I find myself often disagreeing with the populist rationale of Mr. Limbaugh, I find him entertaining and I often agree with his  conclusions.  The fact that he sends liberal reactionaries like these idiots through the roof makes him all the more entertaining.     Actually, I find Limbaugh's oratory less than sizzling and his debating skills sometimes lacking, even though his conclusions are often correct.  I would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated  political power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the \\\"right\\\" things (where \\\"right\\\" is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement) is showing an acute case of \\\"myopic social perspective\\\", not to mention arrogance and utter stupidity.  Limbaugh is certainly far from perfect, but his opponents in the established body politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of virtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry, and for the elimination of local control over Affairs Public.    Perhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated  like errant children by a self-important group of arrogant controlling myopic  people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the \\\"oughta-be's\\\" inside their own hopelessly closed minds.     OK, let us take your word for that and work with it.  A nice specific incident.     Hmmm, \\\"Congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion, nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\\\"  Liberal translation: \\\"the federal government (as long as it is run by Liberals) may force local school districts to include certain iconic content in Christmas displays, while prohibiting others.\\\"  I think Limbaugh has you on this one.  It seems to me that he is arguing for LESS imposition of the federal government into religion.  Nice job on the specificity of that one, too.    [Analysis of historical/modern communication media deleted]    Ah yes, it is a conspiracy of profound proportions.  Methinks that you may be a bit resentful of Mr. Limbaugh's success because you attribute it primarily to luck (how, after all, could anyone with profound differences of opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of conspiracy or blind luck!)  Do you feel this same level of knee-jerk resentment against lottery winners, or do you congratulate them on their good fortune?     This should be great fun, since it is the Liberal movement in America that is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People and business (government/business 'partnership' indeed), and Mr. Limbaugh  is the populist nemesis of that movement.  I have read Mr. Limbaugh's book, and although it was not the most literary piece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain \\\"venom\\\" at all, let alone \\\"venom\\\" comparable to an individual who callously murdered millions out of racism.     A very serious tone in that oratory.     You neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show,  BTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather than blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention  that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions. He also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much). This is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is treated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator.  I am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just kidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and needed to be exterminated.     This is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since Christ was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of the Aryan as \\\"the highest image of the Lord\\\" fits with Christian doctrine.     Private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than publicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo- Christian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent to Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching just a wee bit here.     Definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment industry here.    Just a guess here, but I don't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate government control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show to confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the depraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control  of Hollywood.  90's Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control  of our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an early age the \\\"right\\\" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr.  Limbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the \\\"young heads full of mush\\\" hyperbole indicates.     Pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for government power to be used to break up the conspiracy.     Indication here that \\\"Elements of the Media\\\" (since career is a self-selected categorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in the populace at large') has a leftist bias.  Doesn't sound too unreasonable. No insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the situation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.  You may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable  opinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his  audience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that  purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree  or other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who  is being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?  Again, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would oppose government control of the media.              It is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance. Liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people who disagree with them.  Why don't you challenge conservative ideology on an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons? Perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that they exist in your mind, not the real world.     Perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve Rush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading laughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.  As to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings. Mr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend of government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism in America through \\\"business/government partnership\\\" and increased levels of taxation.  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes in grade school.     Hmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler because he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of racism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to racism; I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear  racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal  Left.  The Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked on the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized Education, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to  that Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear to me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush  Limbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than  the other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.

We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is, is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of us who have bikes are familiar.  Let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its own, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to get rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches to transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to remain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike, through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the same way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along  a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change  surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact  patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It  probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice,  but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like  because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a  better way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch forces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface. You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it was the rotation that did it.  Looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple. Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them about the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels. How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not sideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski or skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels. I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like that, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect. Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try one of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very much like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn. So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's, a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have countersteering.  Conclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have motorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what real effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations of how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm  willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering.   If you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's behaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.\",\":  : nobody seems to have noticed that the clipper chip *must* have been : under development for considerably longer than the 3 months that : clinton has been president.  this is not something that choosing : choosing bush over clinton would have changed in the slightest; it has : been in the works for some time.

Please keep that in mind as you read this post - I do not wish to attack environmentalism)  A half truth is at least as dangerous as a complete lie.  A complete lie will rarely be readily accepted, while a half truth (the lie subtly hidden) is more powerfully offered by one who masquerades as an angel of light.  Satan has (for some people) loosened the grip on treating the earth as something other than God's intricate handiwork, something other than that on which the health of future generations is based.  It is being treated with respect.  You think he's going to happily leave it at that?  No.  When one error is rejected, it is his style to push people to the opposite error.  Therefore the earth is not God's intricate handiwork, not because it is rubbish, but because it is God.  Mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve.  I see two facets of a response to it:  1: Care for the environment.  Treat it with proper respect, both because it is    God's intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because    showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not    constitute what the Apostle Paul called \\\"becoming all things to all men so    that by all possible means I might save some.\\\"     Don't say \\\"Forget the environment, I've got important things to spend my time    on.\\\" - putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your    credibility in expressing the things that _are_ more important.  2: Show that it is not the ultimate entity, that it is creature and not    creator.  Show that its beauty and glory points to a greater beauty and    glory.

I don't think that too many people are fearful that McLane will meddle in the team as he has already admitted that he doesn't know a whole lot about baseball. McLane is a businessman, and doesn't like excuses.  He makes a valid point that injuries shouldn't be an excuse to this club.  Look at the depth of the bench this season.. Canadele can play 7 positions; Bass and James are solid outfielders and can hit well too; Uribe is nice to have as well..  The pitching staff has 6 legitimate starters.

Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force air into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake valve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only the difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after the exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the intake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time does the pressure ever become \\\"negative\\\", or even approach a good vacuum.  2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up to the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume that must flow through the intake, because of the temperature difference and the products of combustion.  3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty horsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes, substitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost zero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very well anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make very little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is _much_ louder than the stocker.  4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor. If free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference was noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.  5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any given RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it on the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower. Pumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\",\"    Hi:     Does anybody known how much about to buy an ethernet card for mac se ?

Property ownership may not be ideal, but it is far better at letting people get what they need to live a productive, fulfulling life.  The first experiment in America, where property ownership was denied, caused, starvation, hunger, and death.  Few people know that the Pilgrims originally tried to have common property to grow food and a common food store.  Many people know the hardships they suffered the first few winters because of it.  After arriving, the Pilgrims made all property common.  They all shared in the work and the resulting crops went into a common store.  After much debate the new Governor Bradford privitized the land; assigning plots to each family.  According to Perry D. Westbrook:  \\\"The change was immediately justified by the increased industry of the inhabitants and by the larger acreage planted.\\\"  experience that was had in this common course and condition, tried sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince the vanity of that conceit of Plato's and other ancients applauded by some of later times; that the taking away of property and bringing in community into a commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing; as if they were wiser than God.  For this community (so far as it was) was found to breed much confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been to their benefit and comfort.\\\"  Bradford did not blame this failure on the \\\"strangers\\\", but on the basic selfishness in all men.  He wrote \\\"seeing all men have this corruption in them, God in his wisdom saw another course fitter for them.\\\"  In other words, according to Westbrook, \\\"Bradford found private enterprise to be the most suitable economic policy for mankind in its fallen state.\\\"  Let's not make the same mistake that the Pilgrims made.  Private property allows a society to flourish, the alternative brings starvation, poverty and discontent.\",\"I would like advice on how to configure my 486 to accept: - Com1 + Com2  (currently on IRQ 4 and 3) - LPT1 (IRQ7) - Bus Mouse (IRQ5) - Sound Card (no idea what to do - can be set to any) -  using IRQ2 for Bus MOuse gobbled up too many cycles, and caused loss of communications with floppy disks, and a few other  problems.

In addition to the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another set integrated into the front turn signal assembly.  For those of you who don't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic growth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out of the front fender, which incorporated amber \\\"parking lights\\\", amber side marker lights/reflectors, white \\\"cornering lamps\\\" (like American luxury cars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators on, and white \\\"backup lights\\\" aimed towards the back of the car when you have selected reverse gear.

To summarize:    SPACE ADVERTISING     First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very common practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the space launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the (very prominent) logos on its side of    - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)    - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)    - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and    - the GPS/Navstar program office    This has not been considered \\\"paid advertising\\\" but rather \\\"public relations\\\", since the restrictions have been such that only organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the side, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting a 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras is \\\"advertising\\\" as much as it is \\\"public relations\\\", in my opinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]    There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials for use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large advertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of several serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at putting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload bay.  These ventures would be different than \\\"public relations\\\", in that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms participating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For example, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras would scan past it.)    ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES    The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about 1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe company was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly, Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last Olympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from participating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for example, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the British visiting cosmonaut to Mir.    Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch vehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements on the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie \\\"The Last Action Hero\\\".  Besides the usual logos of the participating organizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the main fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its booster rockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for one month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in Space News magazine a couple of months ago.    (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is talking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the space program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on the upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it \\\"would not use his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and receiving compensation.\\\"   This is being disputed, since the launch is a \\\"commercial launch\\\" and NASA is receiving none of the advertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is coming from NASA.)    ORBITAL \\\"BILLBOARDS\\\"    Orbital \\\"billboards\\\" have been the staple of science fiction for some time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert Heinlein described another in \\\"The Man Who Sold the Moon\\\".  Several different potential projects have been developed, although none have been implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the \\\"Eiffel II\\\" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in orbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.

What if one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon?  Also, is there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed, period?   Question #2  As I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns. Is there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if you were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting in your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending  trial for the shooting?

Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.  value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in  usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus.  The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound.   In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing.  In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the word \\\"value\\\" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as \\\"objective values.\\\"  Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow. Just because the word \\\"values\\\" is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts.  If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  So, back to the original question:  And objective morality is.....?  If you can provide an objective foundation for \\\"morality\\\" then that will be a good beginning. \",\"   The OpenLook window manager source is available on the MIT contrib tapes   or from  export.lcs.mit.edu  .I would suggest building this too, rather than   using the version from OpenWindows.

Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically     reduces a woman's chances of getting vaginal candida, a yeast infection.   For the year-long study, researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical     Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recruited 13 women who suffered from  chronic yeast infections. For the first 6 months, the women each day ate 8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second  6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the     women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection  were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.      The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.   It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The    researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some     brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus          thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used   in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a          protective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to   try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists      acidophilus in its contents.                                             --- end ---                                                ===================================  InfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92   THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED   ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS   MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

I am a picky eater and never wanted to  try chinese food, however, I finally tried some in order to please a girl I was seeing at the time.  I had never heard of Chinese restaurant syndrome.  A group of us went to the restaurant and all shared 6 different dishes.  It didn't taste great, but I decided it wasn't so bad.  We went home and went to bed early.  I woke up at 2 AM and puked my guts outs. I threw up for so long that (I'm not kidding) I pulled a muscle in my tongue.  Dry heaves and everything.  No one else got sick, and I'm not allergic to anything that I know of.    Suffice to say that I wont go into a chinese restaurant unless I am  physically threatened.  The smell of the food makes me ill (and that *is* a psycholgical reaction).  When I have been dragged in to suffer through beef and broccoli without any sauces, I insist on no MSG.   I haven't gotten sick yet. \",\"     Sheesh.  The rumor mill strikes again.  But let's just assume this were true. My question is this:  What would Montreal give San Jose if the Sharks got first pick and took Daigle? \",\"Dear Rob,   Sometimes I do come across condesending, and I am sorry I come across that way at times.  Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll try to get better.  Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far, only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.  Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K.  vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.   I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with his set of excuses.    I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.  From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I  see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away from the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see the dialog:   Me:  \\\"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\\\"   BK:  \\\"There is no truck.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around at look.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at      the oncoming truck.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around or you will run over.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\\\"  Me:  \\\"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing       to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\\\"       I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.  BK:  \\\"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.       Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\\\"       And by the way, I really have an open mind.\\\"   So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?     I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have. I can now see the truck behind Brian.  My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the truck coming towards him.

About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes  under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement  of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of  the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced  the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor   suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.   While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being   manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently  increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (  palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part  the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had  been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the  pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is   persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3  and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides  minor reductions in pain and is only short term.     My questions are:        Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the      levels of pain?       Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?       Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?     Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.         Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.    If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup   that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated.                \",\"  For example, if it were instinctive not to murder...

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.    Contents:  * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key? * What references can I start with to learn cryptology? * How does one go about cryptanalysis? * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance? * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem? * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice? * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are   relatively easy to break?   * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?    The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted   acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A   by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone   who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.    A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so   that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is   the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art   of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when   you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both   cryptography and cryptanalysis.    The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is   called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert   plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert   ciphertext into plaintext.    A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The   algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,   Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different   values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.    The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are   called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,   eavesdroppers, or third parties.  * What references can I start with to learn cryptology?    For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given   in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,   concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,   these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has   developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and   mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is   encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up   to the mid-60's.    Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or   Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want   to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common   mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.    The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of   many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently   several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The   book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range   of security including encryption algorithms, database security,   access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments   apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].    The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite   technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in   the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of   DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses   of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on   modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management   and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and   networks.    The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on   the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.  * How does one go about cryptanalysis?    Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of   analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern   finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available   textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series   [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for   the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given   systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the   cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still   classified.    Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,   or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare   of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the   most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.  * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?    In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can   find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.    Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding   ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the   plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or   decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.   Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this   brute-force search is impractical.        Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered   practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years   now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with   this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the   mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic   decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel   machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.   Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].    One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a   brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.  * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?    The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key   rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.    A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The   unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of   ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and   if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount   of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is   probably strong.    A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears   random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).        A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A   system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.    If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily   strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.   However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is   strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then   he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring   integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.  * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?    Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical   cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your   ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might   assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is   correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the   rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same   plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus   he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he   doesn't have a chance.    Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,   for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even   chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into   the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See   [KAH67].    * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are   relatively easy to break?\",\": ======================================================================== : Jo Pelkey                                   Phone: (509)375-6947 : Battelle Pacific Northwest Labs             Fax:   (509)375-3641 : Mail Stop K7-22                             Email: je_pelkey@pnl.gov : P.O.

Luke's account is highly suspect (I would refer you to the hermeneia commentary on Acts).  Moreover Luke's account is written at least 90 years after the fact.  In the meantime everyone he mentions has died and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established. Moreover, Pauls account of some of the events in Acts (as recorded in  Galatians) fail to establish the acts accounts.

I am more used to the dip stick for a cage where the stick is extracted fully, wiped clean and reinserted fully, then withdrawn and read.  The dip stick on my bike is part of the oil filler cap and has about 1/2 inch of threads on it.  Do I remove the cap, wipe the stick clean and reinsert it with/without screwing it down before reading?  The service manual calls for the application of Suzuki Bond No. 1207B on the head cover.

I was raised as a Unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as an agnostic, but recently I have developed the firm conviction that the Christian message is correct and I have accepted Jesus into my life. I am happy, but I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible and quite possibly about what Christians should hold as true. This I am trying to rectify (by reading the Bible of course), but it would be helpful to also read a good interpretation/commentary on the Bible or other relevant aspects of the Christian faith. One of my questions I would like to ask is - Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological works intended for a lay person?  I have another question I would like to ask. I am not yet affiliated with any one congregation. Aside from matters of taste, what criteria should one use in choosing a church? I don't really know the difference between the various Protestant denominations.  Thanks for reading my post.   Sincerely,  Steve Hoskins\",\"  Oh yea?  Which version of the Bible is the perfectly preserved one?  And why are there so many translations that are not perfectly preserved?  Is God trying to confuse us?   But that is exactly what happend.  There are so many branches of  denominations of Christianity and deviations of doctrine portruding from varying translations of biblical texts by \\\"serious students\\\" that are much too numerous to begin to count.  If there is a Perfect Bible, then there would be no possible misinterpretation and there would be no need for anyone here to be debating it.  On the other hand, maybe the Bible is perfect, but no one on this planet is perfect enough to read it correctly, but then there would be no point in God giving us something we cannot use correctly.   IMHO, if you trust your salvation on the reliability of a single book, you are on weak ground.  Remember, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  This Word existed BEFORE the Bible was written.  (Note: Word <==> God).  This Word that John is trying to describe cannot be fully described in any written language, all languages being IMPERFECT.  Realization comes only from contemplation of the Word, and is outside the boundaries of language.  I use the Bible as a guide, a stepping stone, but in no way is it my final authority. God alone is the final authority.\",\"G'Day  Windows NT is a step forward, but not by much. I guess for DOS users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to  be able to use more than 64K of memory, its a major improvement. For Windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for  granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running  3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even  a real issue. My ideal operating system:   Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize  binaries and configure on the fly, so I don't have to have  bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc...   Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac   and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which   has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in   80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips.  Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems.   Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton   or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform   or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly.  so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on    my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential.   Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS  or NT or OS/2, and run shell scripts or command/BAT files.   Object oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have  to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch  or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly.  In other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight, clean kernel so you can actually understand it.

Very little acne as a teenager. I didn't have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily it really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry.   Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day vitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it   is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease  on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating meat).  Keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it softens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with oilyness.   Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't be an infection afterwards.  Tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry makes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples).  \",\"      But good ones can collapse somewhat, then come back the next year. Burleigh Grimes went from 20+ wins and an ERA of 3 or so in '24 to 13-19 and an ERA around 4 in '25.  He pitched well for several more years.  Carlton won 13 and lost 20 the year after his 27-10 record. (Source: Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract.)      And let's not forget John Tudor, who started 1-5 and finished 21-6 in 1985.  He had a pretty bad ERA when you take Busch Stadium into account at the start of the season.        If I recall, he had a 4.50 ERA in the 1st half and a 3.50 ERA in the 2nd half of last year.        Hmmm, 21 runs in 11 innings.  Suppose he starts 30 more games, and winds up w/200 innings pitched.  If he allows 4 runs a game in the next 189 innings, he'll have a 4.75 ERA or so at the end of the year. (I think I have his totals right.) This is going to be hard to come back from.        My 1st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy, and that he may be pitching through an injury and not telling anyone.  My 2nd guess is that he will be banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts. (Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL?  Or will Danny Cox, who went 3 or 4 scoreless innings against the Tribe today, start for Morris?  He looks like a really good one.  Gaston is scrambling to find starters, I'd imagine. Luckily, the Jays have a very good offense.)      I don't think they would dare release him before the end of the year.

At VHF, you don't want a _big_ antenna, you want a _resonant_ antenna.   \",\" Yeah, and it's also true most long complicated sequences of events, calculations, or big computer programs in general.  I don't argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I just question whether you >should<.  The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we can't model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That has been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human perception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don't think it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather that the model be improved in a more explicable manner.  I guess I just haven't seen all these earth-shaking fractal models that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I really hope I do, but I'm not holding my self-similar breath.   Uh huh.  I'll believe it when I see it.  I've been chasing fractal compression for a few years, and I still don't believe in it.  If it's so great, how come we don't see it competing with JPEG?  'Cause it can't, I'll wager.  Actually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression work- and I was trying- because I don't think it's a reasonable alternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)  I'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That's why I don't think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their sleeves that make their demos work, but I don't see anyone using it in a real product.  It's been six years since Iterated Systems was formed, right?   \\\"There are always going to be questions until there's a product  out there,\\\" Sloan replies.  The company plans to ship its first  encoding devices in the summer, he says.  In March, Iterated  Systems will have the other half of the system: the decoders.    - Scientific American, March 1990, page 77\",\"I would like to keep track of X development on: - A/UX - ULTRIX - OpenWindows Currently I cannot use the newsgroup comp.windows.x  and would like to use the Email based info.

We will then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want.

Thanks.\",\": There are chips which perform the voice compression/expansion.  They can't : be expensive, because they exist in many phones connected to PBXs or on the : PBX line cards, as well as in a lot of equipment which compresses : voice-grade circuits to save the cost of long-distance, leased T1s or : satellite circuits.  : I can't remember the generic term for these chips.  My impression is that : this was a big deal 10 years ago, but circuits have gotten so cheap that : it isn't done much now.  Codecs.  They have to get about 6:1 compression on 8 bit samples to squeeze them down v32bis.  I played around with the lossless 'shorten' program last night, but it only managed 2.5:1.  I've got some specimen CELP code but it's not obvious that it runs in real time; I think it's just proof-of- concept code, and I have some mucking about with file formats to do before I can put my own sample through it.  Looks like the current option is to use a voice-mail modem with built-in DSP chip to do this in hardware.  That means two modems for a system, putting the cost at $600 upwards.  Ouch.  Maybe soon we'll be able to do it in software on high-powered games consoles - isn't the 3DO an Acorn RISC machine inside?  That cpu runs like shit off a shovel... and will be nicely mass-market too.\",\" ------------ Part 6 of 14 ------------ MAZ)75U=7R!1KP\\\"5A8=F>`7;UG)\\\\&V0&>*YZ>*W5&$'Z]M;T0AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX=7HLAL(;7(5U\\\\,MEIH@$H^,#\\\",4*&?8%'U#6#,-V`W!H>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'A[0E9:0E97PM8]8M9#MH M6CNL]%&'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AUL4SU=7Z/*V&U<2X!!:6M3BYK7L:.Q-TZ#Q M[/%#\\\\>SL[.R'AX>'A\\\\!$%$-:U`Q7S]1_S\\\\BB%!2B5Q2'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'A\\\\\\\"@ M`B'Q(DCQ[$H=L;FGO;5:X(>'AX>J\\\"<]75\\\\B`P;Z@,-\\\"X@^&?S%$<JPV?-P;K MH9\\\\WS!=@-XQ<AX>'AS'$9@L+I4=Z>BJ[P#9U)5L4`LA75P);V6$KGJEXE5-3 M[>V+BXN+BXN+BXN+BXLT-,7%-#0T-#0T-#0T-#0TBXN+[>WM4[\\\"PSU?/@$H, M5\\\\]-(8AH:(#!0]QH:&S30QVQ:$,0L;&([/%'1T='W]_?W]_?W]^I=3:F:JQ2 M`2NTOJYN#N`0:.SP99LI])0GGV!1%X&,]\\\"0M<(>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AS'$9F8+I:5'1Z6E M\\\"V;$,3$QQ,3$9F8+\\\"PNEI0L+9L0Q,3$Q,3$Q,3'$Q&9F9@L+\\\"PL+\\\"PMF\\\"PL+ M\\\"PL+9L3$Q#$QAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX=4 M5%22DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2 MDI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*25%145%145%145%145%14%A86%A86%LG)R<G)R<G) MR<G)R<G)R<G)R<G)R<G)R<G)R<F)B8F)B8F)B8F)B8F)B8G)R<G)R<G)B8F) MB8F)B8F)B8F)3$Q,3$P/9\\\\4T-(OM[>U3L!D9<3T]F0,#7KN[*BHJ*GIZ>M_?

And they are doing 'it' again. Are you so  blind?   Kurds 'R' us; Armenians 'R' not.   Excuse me?   \\\"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as    ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work    of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village.    Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts    into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable    and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets    completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They    found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border    into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole    length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to    Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain    plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of    Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for    howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the    scattered bones of the dead.\\\"                                Ohanus Appressian                             \\\"Men Are Like That\\\"                                    p. 202.   A genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an  attempt to exterminate a race. This is the worst crime in history.  It happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian  dictatorship. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst  ways imaginable. It is sickening to think that the human race is capable  of such actions, but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian  genocide of 2.5 million Muslims happened.  People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were  killed in the Turkish genocide. I understand their anger that there  are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place,  despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million Turks has been  well documented over the past six decades. We cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race.

Where is your non-existent list of scholars. Here is mine: During the First World War and the ensuing  years - 1914-1920, the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated  and systematic genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy  of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering  2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year  homeland.  The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

Mark Alan Epstein, 'The Ottoman Jewish Communities and their Role   in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries,' Klaus Schwarz Werlag,   Freiburg (1980).    page 19:   <<During the fifteenth century, when the Ottomans were struggling to   reestablish themselves in the Balkans, there was considerable turmoil   among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe. Even if   the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the   fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which   Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the   Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the   realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution   in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews   fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that   the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that   there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and   eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the   effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and   persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection   of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,   was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>>     page 21:    <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official   in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi   Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and   the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation   of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from   Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two   recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom   of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European   coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.   This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant   conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of   travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who   would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*)     page 41:   <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were  firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them  and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians  of Europe.   Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is  also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews  as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.  Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians  representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European  sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition  it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,''  their  sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who  regularly reported to the Ottomans.   There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans  in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances  of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited  instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the  early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy  for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman  document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some  Greek towns...>>   page 43:    <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally  accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,  and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of  the situation.>>    page 46:   <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not  particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common  interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition  which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If  there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between  religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was  that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with  the Orthodox.>>   page 46:   <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context  during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of  interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed  Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already  existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish  response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian  countries to Ottoman domains.>>   page 151:    <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the   Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would   characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,   in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and   the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions   elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the   Jews recognized their mutual interests...>>    page 161:    <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success   of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success   in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both   cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough   to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success   without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve   the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear   that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable   partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived.   We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their   success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the   Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries   the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>>   (*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati's [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw:    page 32:    <<Your cries and sobs reached us. We have been told of all the troubles   and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear   the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly   oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and   prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob   and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They   wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren, to the counsel I will   give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German   rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land,   which is blessed by God and filled with all good things. Here I found rest   and happiness; Turkey can also become for you the land of peace...If you   who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with   in this land, you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out   to come to us...Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain   of. We possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. We are   not oppressed with heavy taxes, and our commerce is free and unhindered.   Rich are the fruits of the earth. Everything is cheap, and every one of us   lives in peace and freedom. Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow   hat as a badge of shame, as is the case in Germany, where even wealth and   great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy   among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him   to rob him of his gold. Arise my brethren, gird up your loins, collect   your forces, and come to us. Here you will be free of your enemies, here   you will find rest...>>[13]  [13] Israel Zinberg, A History Of Jewish Literature. vol.V.

At begining of the test, the harddisk will be checked at the speed that usually is.  As the surface test scaned half way through my harddisk, a tremendous slow down occured.  The expected time for operation will jump from 3 to 6 minutes.  I try to use some of the harddisk tools to check if there is any physical damage to my harddisk and report always turn out to be none.

I am a Leaf supporter and I say the Leafs are going down in four unless there is nothing short of a miracle or a stroke of genenius hits Pat Burns.  If you were Pat Burns what would you do?  Living in the Bay area, I do not get enough Leaf coverage to pull something out of the bag,  (I would appreciate comments on the Leaf/Detroit 3rd line match-ups)  but here is the basic idea...  Andreychuck and Borchevsky have no business playing against  the Wings.  They are too small.  The key to any Leafs success will have to be Clark.  He is the only centre who can have any presence within 3-stick lengths of the slot.  Where the hell is Anderson?  Anderson can (in days past) get under peoples skin.  Put a little more bluntly, Anderson has to be an asshole. He used to be good at it.  We need him now.    Perhaps, perhaps the Leafs can shut down Detroit's second line. I was dissappointed to see Shepard and Yserbeart flying last night. These guys are the \\\"swing\\\" players for the Wings.  Last year they did a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick exit of the Wings.  **THis has to happen again**.   Clark-Anderson-Gilmour should be able to out hustle this line.  Anderson should do a nasty on Yserbeart.  Clark should bang the hell out of Sheppard.   Score Gilmour score!  Suggestions:  Clarke-Anderson-Gilmour vs. Sheppard-Yserbeart-??        Andreychuck-Borchevsy-??  vs. Detroit checking line        Toronto's checking line  vs. Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert (pray lots)  * as suggested - i would bench Andreychuck and Borchevsky to stir things up    and through a monkey wrench into Detroits game plan.  However,   if the Detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play their   checking line against these \\\"finesse\\\" players - well then   let them play.  ** Potvin can not be faulted on 5 of the goals - keep him in. ** Van Hellamond can not be faulted for the Leafs demise either. ** The Wings defense shut down the Leafs (especially in the slot).

Earlier, I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs.  One guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well, I saw one think that someone said about \\\"Show me a team that used Split- fires....\\\"  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.  Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and increased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires increased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing on horsepower numbers.  Now how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that depends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine? In the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque, but 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low. So for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.  But what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins, but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for the hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However, twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this translate?  Increased torque should \\\"theoretically\\\" help twins make more power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods or anything made, just stick 'em in.  Now I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with somebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than 4's.          As far as racing teams....  Ducati team \\\"Fast by Ferraci\\\" used splitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James running for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then.

It's not _too_ much of a load on our Ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each segment).

Say you have a 486 33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have 10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns because you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.  Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).

I bought a car about two weeks ago.  I finally can get hold of the previous owner of the car and got all maintanence history of the car.  In between '91 and '92, the instrument pannel  of the car has been replaced and the odometer also has been reset to zero.

Wish I could fit all that into a .sig file! (If someone is keeping a list of Bobby quotes, be sure to include this one!)    The Flat-Earthers state that \\\"the Earth is flat\\\" is a fact. I don't accept this, I think it's an unproven opinion, and I think the Round-Earthers are right because they have better evidence than the Flat-Earthers do.  Although I can't prove that a god doesn't exist, the arguments used to support a god's existence are weak and often self-contradictory, and I'm not going to believe in a god unless someone comes over to me and gives me a reason to believe in a god that I absolutely can't ignore.

So far, atheism hasn't made me kill anyone, and I'm regarded as quite an agreeable fellow, really. :)\",\"For those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to think about airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from  Dennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated at 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to the relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay pins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.  I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube frame used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to do this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two vertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing follows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing. The compressor is about 2\\\" in diameter and about 5\\\" long.  The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small so there should be plenty of good places for it.  I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to mount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side just in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.  The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out about an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look closely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight ahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).  If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try to explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them first.  How do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound more like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock. I have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has not blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).  I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though they know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping the pedestrians on the sidewalk. The bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to those stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives) and are relatively easy to install on the FJ. YMMV.\",\"Hello everyone.  I'm new to motorcycles so no flames please.  I don't have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:  1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have  to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too  ignorant to know I need to buy)  2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?

Actually, the words \\\"A well regulated Milita, being necessary to the security of a free state\\\" is a present participle, used as an adjective to modify 'militia', which is followed by the main clause of the sentence, the subject being 'the right', the verb 'shall'.  It asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for maintaining a milita.  The sentence doesn't restrict the right, or state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other than the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a right of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First, Fourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment. The existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the amendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the right to bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of a free state. In other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep and bear arms is UNCONDITIONAL.    The final word on liberties and rights should not belong \\\"to the many\\\".

The list:   Amiga ROM upgrade to at LEAST 2.04, preferably 2.1+, with appropriate  DOS and Workbench.   1 meg Agnus chip for the Amiga.   Amiga hard drive and controller (preferably SCSI).   IBM-compatible hard drive (and controller if not MFM).  This one's   touchy, as I have a full-height and don't have room for more unless  I swap out--needs to be above 100M, and I will consider trading a  good ST-4096 in the deal.   Intel 9600EX or 14.4EX or similar EXTERNAL high-speed modem. \",\" Remember the armor of God?  The sword that Christians wield is the Word of God, the Bible.
