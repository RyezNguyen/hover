Why or why not?\",\"  At the risk of starting the 'my gun is better than yours' flame war, I must disagree.    There is no secret in handling a Glock.  In fact, it is often chosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver does basically.  It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the fact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence less training time required.    Smith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht they do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) which if properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gun from the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and would not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various  gun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little test where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked people with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and shoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver times were pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, or the person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.   You don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger which can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing city,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..   Of course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but such training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I know if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off chance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that 'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time to draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late.   Don't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks in my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact, it was my first handgun.

As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye  stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population  there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately,  the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass  graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed  what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.  The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of  oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot  officials and their violation of the co-founder status of  the Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat  engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution  to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked  Turkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and  only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues  consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories  to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply  was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at  all. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which  was openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece.  Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish  population, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder of the republic with the Greek population.  The Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-minded Greeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with a minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their  autonomy in a separate republic.  Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would rather not be involved with the island. But, given the dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish population in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate of the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots of their rights, liberties and their very lives.

I have loaded the Basic OS (which includes nsu) and        inet utilities (tcp/ip).        I ftp-ed the XFree86 (X11R5) binaries and installed properly.    I can execute startx and run X-windows with no problems.  However, if I try to access the tape drive while in X, the  machine locks up instantly.  If I am out of X and access the  tape, the tape drive works fine.  Soon as I try to  startx again; the screen changes modes, but, the grey background  pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked.  I have to login  from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system.   I've contacted Esix about this problem.  They claim THEIR X-window X11R4  server (which I have) works with the Wangtek tape drive.  They also   claim I only need the nsu (network system utilities) to run X; I don't  need inet (tcp/ip).  My experience has been that I need BOTH to get  XFree86 to work.  I'm not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet  packages to get X to work unless the inet package is causing my problem.   I would like to get both X and my tape drive to co-exist on the same  system.  If you can shed any light on the problem, it would be appreciated.

Science has its basis in observable fact.   I'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is interpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on the values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such, is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human activity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or ethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.  Bill  : If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must : first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering : the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  : So, back to the original question:  : And objective morality is.....?  This may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory. Objective in the sense used here means something immutable and absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of people. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The concept supposedly described may have meaning however.  If there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then He has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His existence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed, He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an objective sense. If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective. If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous, meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to meet that standard is therefore objectively determined. Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself doesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural norm, or the preferred conduct of \\\"decent\\\" people, making it seem subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard. Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe.

If the most Frequently Asked Question in rec.motorcycles is \\\"What is the DoD?\\\", then the second most Frequently Asked Question must be \\\"How do I get a DoD number?\\\" That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List (KotL, accept no substitue Keepers) for a number. If you're feeling creative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can make a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non- base-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not that you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)  Oh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'll just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole net, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.  By now you're probably asking \\\"So who's the KotL already?\\\". Well, as John Sloan notes below, that's about the only real \\\"secret\\\" left around here, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself, nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was the original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the KotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely with hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line- oriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting messages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with \\\"weenie mailers\\\"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a Dead-Head.  ***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************  Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically groveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed work for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting something done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!) days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of economic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yet another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it just makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an excersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request was submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think the KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).  ***********************************************************************  One more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what they used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya? The typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, & e-mail address. For example:  0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM  (PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only requirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, as there are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)  Blaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner   blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com  ------------------------------------------------------------------------              \\\"Denizens of Doom\\\", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)        [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce's permission]  There is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal  things that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and   motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,   helmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve seats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy,  traffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double  entendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They  argue with each other and plan rides together.  The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that,  although they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each  other face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world  and communicate with each other electronically via computer.  The computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;   the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry  professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently,  rec.motorcycles (pronounced \\\"wreck-dot-motorcycles,\\\" it's the file name for  the group's primary on-line \\\"meeting place\\\") carries about 2250 articles per  month;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent  posters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred  to as the DoD.  The DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of  parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer  enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, \\\"Denizen  of Doom.\\\"  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of  the Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of  course, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.  The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules  appealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the  List, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been  almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and  Canada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France,  Germany, Norway and Finland.  Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run  of 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the  American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser --  selling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a  few months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were  donated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500  to the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs  in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.  As often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go  riding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of  DoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's  \\\"Silicon Valley.\\\"  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on  Rollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California  \\\"Joust.\\\"  The Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big  barbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern  California ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north,  meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan  for 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction  with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.  Though it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective  communications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional  motorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in  search of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to  get together.  Long may they flame.   \\\"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live\\\" [centerbar]  This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which  you can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do  anything like that face to face.  These insults are known as \\\"flames\\\";   issuing them is called \\\"flaming.\\\"  Flames often start when a member  disagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A  typical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be  something like:  \\\"What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad  poseur!\\\"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense  of the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding  ability and your cat.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------            _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_                    by John Sloan  DoD #0011  Periodically the question \\\"What is DoD?\\\" is raised. This is one of those questions in the same class as \\\"Why is the sky blue?\\\", \\\"If there is a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?\\\" and \\\"Why do women inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they dump you?\\\", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition, and philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion by philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the halls of academe for generations.   A long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on a computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two machines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another via a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but who was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of the various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and signed it \\\"The Denizen of Doom\\\". Not wishing to identify himself, he asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time become DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking individual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed.   He who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was the funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty easily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership number.   Perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a motorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or make or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized electronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a part of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a gestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight ratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open minded enough to accept us as members.   In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have never met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet feel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized and run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the network via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list (often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the same region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating around the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by #11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and distributed on VHS by #18)!   Where will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races, placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine management computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards? Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal room and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell.   The DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net access and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only ask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few really good club secrets). New members will receive via email a membership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which includes name, state, and email address.   The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least until next year when we may decided to change the name).

The Names have been changes to protect the Guilty (riders) and Innocent (the bikes) alike. If you think you recognize a contorted version of your name, you don't. It's just your guilt complex working against you. Read 'em and weep.   We tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. Terrible Barbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to Reverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection:   Terrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!!   Muck: I don't mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW      crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer      11 but what the heck.    Stompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that's all man.  Terrible: Nahhhh, you're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at      least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor!      Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a      Woosh-a-stream.  Stompin: You mean Wee-Stream.  Terrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements???  Stompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let's see      what they say, eh?   Muck: Now men, let's try to be civil about this.  High Tech: Hi, I'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.  Arlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!  Terrible: B.T.???  Arlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.  Muck: Ahhh, look, you're making Terrible gag.  Terrible: What does BMW stand for anyway???   Muck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.  Terrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don't know either.  Muck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear.  Chunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear!  Terrible: Hey, didn't you drop your BMW???  Chunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean       even Villy Ogle flamed me for that!   Muck: It's okay, we all makes mistakes.  Out of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange with Dill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller and the perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush!   Heritick: Heya Terrible, how's yer front to back bias?  Terrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW?  Heritick: Nahhh.  Hooter: Hoot, Hoot.  Buck: Nice tree Hooter, how'd ya get up there?  Hooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!!  Muck: What's a carbujector?  Hooter: Well, it ain't made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!!  Muck: Ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!  Dill: Well, where do we race?  Snob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't      ride!   Muck: No! No! Quiet!  Tread: BMW's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.      They even have luggage made by Sourkraut!  High: My 9 too!  Terrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!!  Stompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!!  Before this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more cohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the infamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin!   Polyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like      I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting      it up on the ole ventral stand!    Terrible: Hopalonga's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka's and      Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too!   Booster: I hate Cavortin.  All: WE KNOW, WE KNOW.  Booster: I love Cavortin.  All: WE KNOW WE KNOW.  Muck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras?  Snob, Tread: Nawwwwww.  Muck: What about a Tridump?  Terrible: Isn't that a chewing gum?  Muck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity?  Heritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?  Muck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make.  Two more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter. Pill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.  Phalanx: Hey, I don't know about that.  And Now even more west coasters pour in. Road O'Noblin: Hopalonga's are the greatest!  Maulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector!  Suddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth: Kite Lanolin: Hey, BMW's are great, men.  Robo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.  More riders from the west coast come into the discussion: Aviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.  Guess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison.  With a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. It was none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn.  Clean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns.   Muck: Why??  Clean: Well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.  Muck: But I only have a 4-banger.  Clean: No GOOD!  Chunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!  Clean: Inferior!  Stompin: Hey, look, here's proof BMW's are better. The Bimmer-Boys burst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me a thrill...   Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for?   Heritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT'S ME,      WILHEM!   Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don't you mean BMW?   And so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the thunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them all boomed out. G.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding      Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions.   All: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease.  Does this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding mini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?  Tune in next week for the next gut wretching episode of \\\"The Yearning and Riderless\\\" with its ever increasing cast of characters.  Where all technical problems will be flamed over until well done.  Next week's episode will answer the question of: \\\"To Helmet or Not to Helmet\\\" will be aired, this is heady material and viewer discretion is advised.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------            Script for the Denizens of Doom Anthem Video                  by Jonathan E. Quist   DoD #94   [Scene:  A sterile engineering office.  A lone figure, whom we'll call Chuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat, with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.]   (editor's note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at the First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizens referring to each other as \\\"Chuck\\\". I guess you had to be there. I wasn't.)   Chuck:  I didn't want to be a Software Systems Analyst,  cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,  may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted  to live a man's life, [Music slowly builds in background]  riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes  and the deepest valleys,  living the life of a Motorcyclist;  doing donuts and evading the police;  terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;  eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short,   I Want to be      A Denizen!  [Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with fringe), boots, and cap.  Scene simultaneously changes to the top of an obviously assaulted Rollins Pass.  A small throng of Hell's Angels sit on their Harleys in the near background, gunning their engines, showering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil on the tarmac.  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat Boy.]   Chuck [Sings to the tune of \\\"The Lumberjack Song\\\"]:  I'm a Denizen and I'm okay, I flame all night and I ride all day.  [Hell's Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]: He's a Denizen and he's okay, He flames all night and he rides all day.  I ride my bike; I eat my lunch; I go to the lavat'ry. On Wednesdays I ride Skyline, Running children down with glee.  [Chorus]: He rides his bike; He eats his lunch; He goes to the lavat'ry. On Wednesdays he rides Skyline, Running children down with glee.  [Chorus refrain]: 'Cause He's a Denizen...  I ride real fast, My name is Chuck, It somehow seems to fit. I over-rate the worst bad f*ck, But like a real good sh*t.  Oh, I'm a Denizen and I'm okay! I flame all night and I ride all day.  [Chorus refrain]: Oh, He's a Denizen...  I wear high heels And bright pink shorts,  full leathers and a bra. I wish I rode a Harley,  just like my dear mama.  [Chorus refrain]  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                      Why you have to be killed.  Well, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed to read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started as a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.  Sometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: \\\"What does DoD stand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it?\\\" Naturally, a Denizen who had watched the movie \\\"Top Gun\\\" a few times too many rose to the occasion and replied:  \\\"That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you.\\\"  And the rest is history.  A variation on the \\\"security\\\" theme is to supply disinformation about what DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where known) include:  Daughters of Democracy (DoD 23)  Doers of Donuts Dancers of Despair (DoD 9)  Debasers of Daughters Dickweeds of Denver   Driveway of Death Debauchers of Donuts   Dumpers of Dirtbikes  Note that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be limited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                       The rec.moto.photo archive  First a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck Rogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made, and several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in unknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not only provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.  Not only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk at their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the server too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages, the general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.  Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how to use the archive.  **********************************************************  Via ftp:  cerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]  Via e-mail:  The address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the message.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The arguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For rec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:  dir [dod] send [dod]bruce_tanner.gif send [dod]dodframe.ps  and you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts of bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.  Oh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to the next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of 50K each; not a good idea. --  Bruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDU Cerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner  **********************************************************  A couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so why not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful? Second, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind of you to access it after normal working hours (California time).   ------------------------------------------------------------------------                        Patches? What patches?  You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches & pins. And your reaction was probably: \\\"I want!\\\", or \\\"That's sick!\\\", or perhaps \\\"That's sick! I want!\\\"  Well, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that there's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad news is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn't because of any \\\"exclusivity\\\" attempt, but simply because there is no \\\"DoD store\\\" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by individual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is someone says \\\"I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost $xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?\\\" Then orders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the pre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a DoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all this is anarchy in action.  Here's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and perpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99), motorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts (DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and patches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by popular demand].  All \\\"profits\\\" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association Motorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been contributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum, you'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of \\\"Denizens of Doom, USENET, The World\\\", complete with a DoD pin.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Here's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.  ~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles ~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu> ~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum ~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT  I received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum, the other day.  \\\"Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:  Congratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the Denizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated is now $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitude to all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presently being prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to  see the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way, I will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.  Again, thank  you for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the museum, and the fulfillment of its goals.

Rides:  Summer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third year, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass trip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got together for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north as NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of North Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great Pacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for riding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have come to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]  Also worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the Moab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up, riding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal 2-strokes.  And though it's not an \\\"official\\\" (as if anything could be official with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races in Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters to gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah. European Denizens have staged some gathers too.

I've also noticed that he usually gets away with it. Just as examples last night, I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in the head, which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens (Scott) and Tocchet 2 minute minors. He also KICKED John McLean. Of course he wasn't called for that. Isn't kicking an automatic match penalty and 10 game suspension? I think Glenn Anderson got one a few years ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest. There's no doubt in my mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall. He's also very good.

Comparing Prince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable.  Prince has never hit well in the minors and he's now 27 years old, I think.  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter in the minors.  (I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't have another brain cramp and forget.)  He had a very good year at Louisville  before coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the  majors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he  became Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation  as an outstanding defensive catcher.  It's not clear he ever learned to hit.  His four years with more than 100 AB--  Born 31 July 1962 Year     AB      BA     SLG     OBA   1988    195    .282    .320    .328 1990    220    .277    .373    .321 1991    459    .264    .351    .317 1992    485    .249    .359    .290   No power, less-than-league-average walks, peak year when he turned 28,  now declining.  If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince, given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors, it's not a rosy picture.

Mike Ruff\",\"The latest Israeli \\\"proposal\\\", first proposed in February of 1992, contains  the following assumptions concerning the nature of any \\\"interim status\\\"  refering to the WB and Gaza, the Palestinians, implemented by negotiations. It states that:        >Israel will remain the existing source of authority until \\\"final status\\\"     is agreed upon;    >Israel will negiotiate the delegation of power to the organs of the      Interim Self-Government Arrangements (ISGA);    >The ISGA will apply to the \\\"Palestinian inhabitants of the territories\\\"     under Israeli military administration. The arrangements will not have a      territorial application, nor will they apply to the Israeli population      of the territories or to the Palestinian inhabitants of Jerusalem;    >Residual powers not delegated under the ISGA will be reserved by Israel;    >Israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd;    >Israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects-     external, internal- and for the maintenance of public order;    >The organs of the ISGA will be of an administrative-functional nature;    >The exercise of powers under the ISGA will be subject to cooperation and      coordination with Israel.     >Israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the      areas of administration, justice, personnel, agriculture, education,     business, tourism, labor and social welfare, local police,     local transportation and communications, municipal affairs and religious     affairs.  Several question do come to mind concerning the \\\"success\\\" we all hope for  in the ongoing negotiation process. These arrangements certainly seem to  be essentially a rejection of any Palestinian \\\"interim\\\" self-control.  Without exposing itself to unwarranted risks and creating irresversible  vulnerability, can Israel reasonably put forward (at later points in the  negotiating process) more \\\"relaxed\\\" proposals for this\\\"interim\\\" period?  How should proposals (from either side) be altered to temper their  \\\"maximalist\\\" approaches as stated above? How can Israeli worries ,and  desire for some \\\"interim control\\\", be addressed while providing for a   very *real* interim Palestinian self-governing entity?

PST                     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING  on the aid package.        SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The  President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed  yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic  and political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.          Before taking your questions and running through the  basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.   First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do  with available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds  have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is  no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund  any of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently  are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin  tomorrow.              The second point is that this package is designed to  support Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package  are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have  been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian  government.              Third, the President is determined that we will  deliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed  to maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we  wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we  feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in  front of you.              Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of  trade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's  capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend  well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of  governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do  so.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make  trade and investment a major priority in the relationship.                They also agreed that there would be a new joint  commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by  Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through  the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote  a vastly expanded relationship.              If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down  the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just  give you some general background on what these programs are.   I'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.              The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food  and medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has  been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian  grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure  there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the  major cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food  for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also  be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and  pharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.              The second item is concessional food sales.  As you  know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship  with Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia  that we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the  Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.   The value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are  concessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out,  but I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on  principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates  thereafter for the life of the deal.              The third program is a collection of private sector  support.  We think this is one of the most important things we're  going to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses  is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.   And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American  enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the  goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in  Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses.                The President has also decided to create a  privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian  government in its priority objective of trying to convert state  enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has  also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a  Eurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by  prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.              The fourth grouping you see there in the summary  page is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that  this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of  pursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total  of $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed  tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're  launching.                The President is also calling for the development of  a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to  try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public  efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in  Russia.              The fifth program you see is Russian office of  resettlement.  This is a new initiative created and  conceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration  project.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military  to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic  states and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to  make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's  with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American  construction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration  basis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working  very closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say  that we have a long-term commitment to this project.                The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They  are two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our  initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the  possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and  gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in  the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much  environmental damage.              I've talked a little bit about trade and investment,  about the new group being created that the Vice President will  chair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing  with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development  committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy,  to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede  trade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time  investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this  problem full-time.                And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and  investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an  analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we  just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a  commitment within our own government to have people work on it --  senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly  important.              You'll notice that the United States is going to  support Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer  status.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested  our advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the  long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is  paramount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are  supporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting  their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.                You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in  credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended  $150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil  project.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an  agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion  framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance  Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services.  We think this is a very important development.  We think we'll  get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo  conference, the G-7 conference.              Before I take any further questions, I'd like to  defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance  objectives with you.              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major  unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts  in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and  secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory  under the terms of the START I and START II agreements.    Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important  agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding  to three important programs.  The first is the program of $130  million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement  program.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for  bomber dismantlement -- $130 million.              The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for  the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed  from the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially  contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the  construction of that storage facility.                And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help  in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear  materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we  add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance  which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall  safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety  measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the  last couple of years.                So this is an area where we will be going a lot more  work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks,  and Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last  couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for  safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian  territory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of  START I, an agreement to accede to NPT.               So we are working very hard with all the parties to  the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with  them.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia  as a very important step in that process.              Q   The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in  Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with  Kazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the  same one, why do you feel it's necessary?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same  deal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil  field.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights  oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced  today.  So it's completely new.              Q   Can you tell us more about what's involved?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like  other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do  two things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west  Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating  oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.   The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the  natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which  will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what  Russia needs.              So we think this deal is very, very good development  for Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an  American company.  And the American government has played a  leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility  in OPIC and through the loan guarantee.              Q   So it's to search and also to renovate fields  that are already there?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.              Q   On that point, should other American companies  expect to get administration support for such deals, or should  they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2  billion?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know,  Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the  U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department  and the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we  think it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th,  there will be $2 billion in financing available for American  companies to sell their equipment and sell their services.              Q   That should take up all of the rest of the  deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be  support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a  tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas  companies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and  gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will  soak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may  even extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.              Q   What's the current year budget costs of that  $2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any  current year budget costs --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer  you to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.              Q   The concessional food sales -- is there any  current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in  which the payments are due?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional  food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.   USDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to  expend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd  refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.              Q   Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?              Q      and the private sector -- how many folks are  going to be involved in that?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start  with the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt  coming into office that there were literally thousands of  organization, private organizations in the United States that in  one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve  democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.   And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that  had a variety of programs in this area.  And so the  administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try  to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give  some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the  efforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.              It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will  soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in  the former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might  use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of  our own government, but the resources of the American private  sector and schools and communities across the nation.              Q      any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word  yet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated  besides the $300 million the President talked about?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration  is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What  the President has done this weekend is to consult really  intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional  measures the United States could take in some of these areas to  support reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he  returns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other  ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.              Q   Two questions about the $700 billion  agricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of  consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.   So why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you  explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans  for food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit  into that situation?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the  United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains  and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think  between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history  here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through  the Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle  to ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of  last year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on  that program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and  therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that  program.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and  other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we  could promote American grain sales.                And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've  announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the  Food for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient  authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked  for a concessional loan program.                I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a  short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but  a long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what  this program is.  It will provide, once the final details are  worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of  principal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the  life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of  interest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we  believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal  for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments  and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this  very important grain relationship, which is important for them,  and it's important for the American farm community.              Q   I gather from what you say that this could make  it explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC  loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through,  is that right?               SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit  about that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing   the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program  because of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you  know about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around  $640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having  taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American  market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to  respond to a specific request from the Russian government for  major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the  grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there,  we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to  great effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with  the Russian government and arrived at this solution.                I think the Russians are pleased because it provides  them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on  the short-term payments.              Q   Where do those funds actually come from?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the  Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's  authority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do  not need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want  to make that general point again:  Everything in this package,  the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been  allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration  can begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very  important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year,  that we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be  able to do so.              Q   How did you arrive at the figure of $700  million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually  have a range from 0 to --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason  for it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us  that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and  harvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the  shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the  harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the  same level of food imports from the West.              Q   I would imagine there's going to be some  considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other  republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.   Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for  the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with  some of the other republics?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very  conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending  American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet  Union.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the  area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that  you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and  roughly 50 percent to the other countries.               In the area of food sales, we have been active with  Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We  will continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this  summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the  other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are  productive and they're hard-hitting.              Q   Has anything happened at the summit to lead  American energy companies and other companies to believe that  Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of  taxing, legalities, bureaucracy?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our  primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not  only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd  like to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're  convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to  support Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of  Western governments have the financial resources over the next  decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private  sector can do that.                We look at our own society and we see tremendous  capability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very  good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial  investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new  technology and new capital to finance new production.                That's what the Russian government has told us it  wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis  on it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on  the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently  last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President  Clinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong  signal to the American business community that we support their  efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex- Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to  support them.              Q   My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to  deliver on making Russia a more --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I  would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr.  Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas  sector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice  President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the  barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil  and gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that  committee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to  the work.              Q   What type of mechanism is already in place to  administer the private sector portion of the program?  And will  the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of  the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the  Russian government for distribution at their will?                   SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking  about the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the  program itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working  through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure  that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to  the intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the  Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can  account for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of  months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of  these programs.              But they are all quite different.  For instance, in  the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it  is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of  the food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working  through Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the  housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers,  we'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the  democratization projects, we're working directly with Russian  private individuals and private foundations.  We're working with  journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have  noticed.              So we literally have here 30 to 40 different  activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be  carried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the  Russian government, some with Russian citizens.              Q   The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and  on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the  President has to do on that?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George  noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in  the relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's  fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we  return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and  we'll get back to the Russian government.              Q   You were not prepared for these questions when  you got here?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared  for these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not  prepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require -- let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require  consultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with  the American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those  concerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before  we take any action.              Q   Is this package designed so that you will not  have to go to Congress for anything at this point?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the  beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all  the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.   So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to  seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In  effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the  agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And  that's the advantage of this particular initiative.              Q   If this, as the President says, is a long-term,  long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment  heading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to  Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are  prepared to go to Congress for various things?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been  clear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with  President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American  funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a  major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by  Representative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that  delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.   And we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where  it stands now.              Q   We've been told repeatedly that a number of  these items represent different or new ways of spending the money  already appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these  items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways  that it was not previously set to be?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've  said that these are all projects that either Congress had  allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were  some funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this  administration took office and had some new ideas about how the  funds might be expended.              We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or  the FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations -- Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to  further our programs.              And example of that is the Food for Progress  concessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of  funding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we  looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American  market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we  found it.              Q   Where, for example, are you getting the money  for this Russian officer resettlement --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the  Freedom Support Act funds.              Q   In other words, all of the money is being  directly spent in new ways, so to speak --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant  projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the  second chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if  you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that  total $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act  funding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year  '92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the  legislative history of those funds.              Q      cooperation --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I  don't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.              Q   Could you tell us please, has anything happened  here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and  Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's  happened here --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents,  President Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this  issue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security  and arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's  session.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly  reinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been  talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple  of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the  discussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very  important negotiation that's been going on essentially between  Moscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially  discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute  to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.                But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend,  I don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.              Q?     Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is  any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current  year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been  earmarked and put it into this fund?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and  mirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We  could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included  out-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to  many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the  privatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already  talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.                We could have put in really big numbers and this  could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:   This package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're  going to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President  feels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy  that the western governments, the combination of governments, put  up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not  able to meet them, we're determined, and the President is  determined, to carry out every single program in this package.   And we'll do it.                But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's  part of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking  for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively  support reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment  on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.              Q      taken it way from any --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.   Okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds;  so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in  Russia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.              Q   In terms of funding, there is no available  monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money  somewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I  don't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the  example is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit  guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay  back within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt  problem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we  looked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement  for grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and  also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers  have a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply  look for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative  authority to do it.  This program has been successful in other  areas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union,  but we thought we should now.                 Q   Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package  for Russia, since these funds were really first derived by  initiatives put forward by President Bush?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think  that's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were  appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This  administration took office and inherited some obligations that  the Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven  week review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments  that had been made by the previous administration.                But we have gone well beyond them in funding the  enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not  been filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to  it.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them  into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say,  is another Clinton initiative.                Further, we listened to the Russian government and  listened to the Russian military who told us that the  resettlement of their officers was important to them for  political and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton  has responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment  that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out  a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.                I would also say that the President has given  impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly  about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we  have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends  itself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the  creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative,  we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private  sector as well as the American government, to achieve that  objective.                So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And  as most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the  last administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last  administration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton  assistance package for Russia.              Q   There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the  past has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this  outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money  will not just disappear because it's being administered by the  Russian government?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I  know that the President and other senior officials of our  government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and  that it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's  intended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the  State Department will take great care in making sure that the  funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their  source.              I would not that this package is not simply a  package of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of  these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are  going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals,  with businesses.  The private enterprise support is another  example of that.              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add  a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one  area that we've been looking at very, very closely is  consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting  for these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely,  of course, with the American firms, who would be the prime  contractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of  a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that  funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in  Russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent  efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.              Q   When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly  when do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President  is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think  it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over  the next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties  on May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over  the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach  out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us  to help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said  that we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate  in a much more effective way the activities of our own  government.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in  Russia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw  them together and to focus their efforts.              Q   Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will  actually be spent in the United States by American made goods?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any  figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something  up in the next couple of days on that.              Q   This figure is larger than the figure that has  been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result  of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think -- unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and  I'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put  us to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was  briefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the  intellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of  the ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we  had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have  been refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week  going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in  Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.   And so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been  together for about two weeks.              Q   Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There  was so much talk before about the President wanted to get  Yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.   Is that in the out years?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.   President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance,  that support for the creation of private businesses is important  to him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is  important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize  the state industries is important to them.                And so what we did was to try to make those the  centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We  listened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been  working with the Russian government for months on this trying to  work out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of  these programs was involved every step of the way.                But let me get at the other part of your question.   The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader  set of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking  for his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the  table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in  housing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to  consult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other  allied governments that are also active.              Q   There's essentially nothing that happened in  the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that  you came in with?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular  package, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks  ago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on  the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've  primarily talked about future, about what more the United States  and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia,  which is our base objective here.              Q   I noticed that you -- that money appropriated  to train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me  what about job training for workers who are displaced by  privatization?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we  have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and  financial services in the United States.  Part of the housing  initiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain  Russian officers who are retiring into other professions.              Q      money for job training for workers whose  jobs are disappearing because of privatization --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet  allocated any money for that.              Q   Why not?              Q      of the $6 million is going to build 450  housing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the  Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do  housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework  of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've  got to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think  about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also  retraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming  out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.   We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers  as well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian  government.              Q      of the $6 million will go to retrain --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.              Q   Are you talking about apartment buildings or  single --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about  single, individual dwellings.              Q   You're saying that only 450 families will be  served by this?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I  thought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.   What we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the  Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building  housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with  a huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next  couple of months and try to figure out with American  organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job  done.                I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.   And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into  this in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to  spend the money wisely.              Q   What is it about this program that convinces  you that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be  in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back,  especially considering their other debt problem?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think  it's important to note that the United States on its own does not  have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.   It's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to  our allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what  the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We  can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do  so, which is consistent with our national interests.              Q   Did the President say that the value of the  U.S. contribution was that it would create security and  prosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this  program that does this?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to  go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia,  and that is we want to do everything we can to support the  continuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay  in power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear  forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction,  which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in  Russia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that  this program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we  have to make a long-term commitment to it.              Q   And then on the question of Russia's ability to  repay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15  years from now?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian  government has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping  is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve  their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency  revenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years  from now to pay back those loans.              Q      substantial government-to-government loan  we've ever gotten into with the Russians?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to  answer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years  on this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because  the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to  just ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of  effort.              Q      government loans in any other sector that  you recall?  I know it wasn't done in --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair  to say this is a new and unique effort.\",\"  [...]   [...]   Quite interesting.

[evil result of human sinfulness, rather than the will of God]  whoo.  i'm going to have to be very careful with my language here.  i think God is voluntarily giving up his omniscience in this world so that we can decide on our own where we go -- free will.  in this sense God allows evil to occur, and in this sense can be \\\"held responsible\\\" as my chaplain says.  however, his will is, of course, that all be saved.  he's not going to save us \\\"by himself\\\" -- we have to take a step in his direction before he will save us.  read that last sentence carefully -- i'm not saying we save ourselves.  i'm saying we have to ACCEPT our salvation.  i do not believe in predestination -- it would appear from what you say further down that you do.    [stuff deleted]  ok -- i have trouble with that, but i guess that's one of those things that can't be resolved by argument.  i accept your interpretation.  [more deleted]         ^^^^^^^^^ this is what indicates to me that you may believe in predestination. am i correct?  i do not believe in predestination -- i believe we all choose whether or not we will accept God's gift of salvation to us. again, fundamental difference which can't really be resolved.  [yet more deleted]  yes, it is up to God to judge.  but he will only mete out that punishment at the last judgement.  as for now, evil can be done by human beings that is NOT God's will -- and the best we can do is see taht some good comes out of it somehow.  the thing that most worries me about the \\\"it is the will of God\\\" argument is that this will convince people that we should not STOP the rape and killing when i think that it is most christ-like to do just that.  if jesus stopped the stoning of an adulterous woman (perhaps this is not a good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we not stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more innocent? \",\"  ( in <1993Apr16.163729.867@batman.bmd.trw.com> )   ( responding to Dave \\\"First With Official A.A Nickname\\\" Fuller )   [ ... ]  That means that it is an effective anti-recidivism measure.  It does not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime in the first place.  The true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually stop one from murdering.  (Or commiting treason -- are there any other capital crimes anywhere in the USA?)  That is, if there were no death penalty, would its introduction deter a would-be criminal from committing her/his crime?  I doubt it.  This is only the first step.  Even if it were a strong deterrent (short of being a complete deterrent) I would reject it.  For what about the case of the innocent executed?  And even if we could eliminate this possibility, I would reject the death penalty as immoral. This makes me something of a radical on the issue, although I think there are many opponents of captial punishment who agree with me, but who find the innocent executed the strongest argument to make.  I would, if magically placed in charge, facilitate state-aided suicide for criminals who have life-sentences.  This could be a replacement for capital punishment.

The real fear comes from them doing more than this.  This is a voluntary program, and thus harder for us to object to on the surface.  Their strategy is a business one rather than legal one.  They are pushing to get a standard in place, a secret standard, and if they get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market. It will be legal to sell better, untapable encryption that doesn't have registered keys, but it will be difficult, and thus not a plan for most phone companies.  You see, with clipper chip phones you'll be able to talk to any cellular company, or other phones or ports because they will follow the standard.  AT&T has already announced a clipper chip encryption product.  The government has marketed hard to get major vendors to use these chips.   If they get enough market share, they will rule.  And thus there will be very little market for systems that can't be tapped by the police.  The public isn't that concerned about it now, after all.  They freely do calls that anybody with an old TV can listen to today!  They won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure them only from the police.  Well, some people will buy these phones, but they will only work with other proprietary phones, so the market will be small and the phones expensive.

Is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is missing the mark?   Are they clear or do you have doubts?   An important first step; the realization that Paul was human.   Yes, and he was writing and speaking for an audience that was at best, very weak in the faith; most could not read, most were unfamiliar with the Hebrew Scriptures in even the Septuagint form. Paul adapted the message of the Bible to a largely uneducated market. Granted, this market still exists today, but do you count yourself as part of it? To be \\\"weak in the faith\\\" is not missing the mark (hamartia) if you do the best that your education allows. Are you doing the best?   Let me make clear that the \\\"Law\\\" is none other than the Pentateuch of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. What did Jesus say about the \\\"Law\\\" in Matt5:14-19? Where did Jesus say that the \\\"Law\\\" only applies to Jews and that Gentiles are above the \\\"Law\\\"?   Who acknowledged this fact? On what basis? Are we extra-biblical at this point? Why not also acknowledge that the Bhagavad-Gita is the only relevant text for Gentiles, after all we see in the Bible that it was Magus from the east who observed the star-signs of Jesus? Why bother with any texts at all? Why not just follow whatever the Church has to say?   I don't see how you can say this with a straight face. Are you a follower of Christ, or do you follow someone else? Are you saying that the words of Jesus only apply to Jews?   How Jewish was Paul after he changed his name from Saul?   Who says Gentile Christians are not covered by the first five books? Who says that Gentile Christians are above the Ten Commandments?   You're implying that Jesus' words are valid only for Jews. Is this really what you mean to say? You do realize that you are gutting rather large portions of the Bible? When you read Jesus' words, did you ever consider that maybe, just maybe Jesus is talking to you, no matter what your race or sex? If the Hebrew Scriptures and the Gospel accounts of Jesus are only directed to Jews, why were they translated into English?   As Paul would call him, one who was weak in the faith.   Which is more important: 1) The recorded word of Jesus or 2) Indications that you can deduce from the Bible? Was Jesus God only of the Jews, or God of all humankind of all race and sex?   This is your understanding of Paul. Compare this to the word of Jesus. Are you Christian or Pauline?   Again, this is your understanding of Paul. Did Jesus say that the Law was an \\\"impossible standard?\\\" Did Jesus say that He superceded the Law? Are you Christian or Pauline?   You acknowledge that it is *your* reading of Paul. What did Jesus say? Can you deny that Matt5:14-19 is quite clear in its meaning? Are you  Christian or Pauline?   When did Jesus say that the purpose of the Law was conviction of sin?   Please reread Matt5:14-19. Are you Christian or Pauline?   Are you saying that the Ten Commandments are ceremonial details?   You call observance of the Sabbath, the day on which the Lord rested, ceremonial? Has circumcision been superceded for Christians?  ....  Are you Christian or Pauline?  [Both.  There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is not, at least not in this case.  Jesus did not deal explicitly with the question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  That's why I have to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.  As to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studies of Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I can't come up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, various Christian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and in other newsgroups.  Mat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid.  It does not say that it applies to Gentiles.  And yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on the Sabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when you're looking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.  I'm not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, it's unfortunate the Jesus didn't answer the question directly.  However we do know (1) what the 1st Cent. Jewish approach was, (2) how Jesus dealt with at least one Gentile, and (3) how Jesus' disciples dealt with the issue when it became more acute (I'm referring to Acts 15 more than Paul).  Given that these are all in agreement, I don't see that there's a big problem.\",\" I just talked to a rep for my AT&T mastercard regarding this:  There is no maximum claim, and you only have to notify them of the warranty when the  item needs repair.

If there is no law that covers a specific subject, say scam insurance companies, a regulator cannot create one.  So they have to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted.  For the California Insurance Commissioner, there are two possible legislative bodies:  the California State Legislature and the U.S. Congress.  We all know how little the California State Legislature accomplishes, esp.  along the lines of insurance reform legislation (negative movement).  So Garamendi wants the feds to do it, because: (a) he has a better chance of getting a federal law through, and (b) since many of the scam companies work across state lines/national borders, it is better to have a law that reach out into other jurisdictions.\",\" It seems sad that people lose all perspective when they here about a case of violence by teenagers...

[I've got a vested interest, since my machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed.] He already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD (again, I forget the model number but I can find out.)  Anyway, I can't seem to get the bloody thing up.  I've managed to get one or the other drive up (with the other disconnected), but not both at the same time; whenever I try, the thing hangs during bootup - never gets past the system test.  The IDE controller's instruction sheet says it supports two drives; I think I've configured the CMOS correctly; the power's plugged in properly; I even learned about the master/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn't know PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpers properly (the 85MB one is the master, the new 210MB one is the slave).  The only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong.  I've tried several combinations:  controller - master - slave controller - slave - master master - controller - slave  None of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can't think of any others.  Another possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into two seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for \\\"C: drive\\\" and \\\"D: drive\\\" setup info rather than \\\"drive 1\\\" and \\\"drive 2\\\" like most others I've seen.  Could this be confusing things?  So, I need HELP!

Thus I've never really believed in God and heaven, although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either - I'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess.         Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how religious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though I want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof - just as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can't definitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by religious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.          Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is correct?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian God exists and the Gods of other religions don't?? How do you feel about people who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me - agnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their beliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isn't there contradiction between the religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do you have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they follow a different religion than you would if they were Christian??          Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in the bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??          I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are fairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and 'Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. The only part I find hard is the actual belief in God.          Finally, what is God's attitude to people like me, who don't quite believe in Him, but are generally fairly 'good' people. Surely not believing doesn't make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering why I so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.          Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they came into my head. I'm sure I probably repeated myself a bit too.

The motto is dangerous in itself, it tells the world that every *true* American is god-fearing, and puts down those who do not fear gods. It doesn't need anyone to make it dangerous, it does a good job itself by just existing on your currency.

He had  a surgery when he was one year old. Another surgery had  to be performed one year after, when he was two years old.  He turned three this February and he is still getting  afflicted by this illness, like having to get hospitalised  for vomitting and accompanying stomach pain.He managed  not having a third surgery so far.    *   One thing me and my wife noticed is that his affliction   peaks around the time he was born, on nearabouts, like in   March every year.  Any significance to this?    * Why does this recur? Me and my family go through severe pain   when our little boy have to undergo surgery. Why does surgery   not rectify the situation?     * Also, which hospital in US or Canada specialize in this malady?    * What will be a good book explaining this disease in detail?    * Will keeping a particular diet keep down the probability of    recurrence?    * As time goes on, will the probability of recurrence go down   considering he is getting stronger and healthier and probably   less prone to attacks? Or is this assumption wrong?    * Any help throwing light on these queries will be highly appreciated.   Thanks very much!\",\"Is anyone familiar with a virus that infects the WINHELP.EXE file?

The Roman Empire lasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  The main reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by the men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had been excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city of Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of Mazinkert.  After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter of time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto the rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle should be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack of Constantinople only hastened the inevitable along.  For if the Greeks had wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the Crusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rd Crusades?  Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they considered heretics, even though those \\\"heretics\\\" were fighting for the cause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkish hordes in Anatolia, Edessa, Lebanon, Palastine, and Syria, the some hordes who were to later sack Constantinople, and overrun a third of Europe (the Balkans, Hungary, the Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc.)\",\"The regular season of the 1992-93 Davis Tabletop Baseball League has just come to an end.  To help us with next year's league, I would appreciate it if you would take a couple of minutes and vote for our league MVP and CY winners.  These awards, and players' standings in them, will inflate their salaries for next year's league.   Please vote for 5 in each category, in order.  For example...   1.  Barry Bonds 2.  Frank Thomas 3.  Biff Pocoroba 4.  Shooty Babitt 5.  \\\"Lips\\\" Lundy.   Please do NOT vote for pitchers in MVP voting for this league.  Each team in the league gets one candidate for MVP, and one for CY.

(Though I was wrong about your use of the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it said the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that has changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the Nicene - Constantinopolitan did not.  Of course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene Creed (it wasn't there to begin with), but they certainly did from the Athanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.  I might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in ways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East emphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father through the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the Son.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see below)   \\\"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do call God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the root and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the river are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms, but coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must necessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on that account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there are two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is third from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit of the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river, and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray.\\\"  -Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)  and   \\\"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father through the Son\\\"  -Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)  And as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36, Articles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of generation, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession emphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in a more preeminent way.   \\\"For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it from the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the Father alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called unbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of theologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a matter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives to the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit proceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of the Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound mind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each, however, but proceeds from each and both.\\\"  -St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)  So, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at least), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but in proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the procession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the Father through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father, the Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any mention of the Son being necessary.  In any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope St. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St. Damsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose of Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the Fathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic position, which I enunciated above.  As for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I will point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke of the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone \\\"to produce, write, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by the Fathers of Nicea.\\\"  That Creed is a different Creed than that of Constantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of course in that they were condemning the adoption of the Constantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of Nicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious, who had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the Church, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy Spirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan Creed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council Chalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been against explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves approved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations of the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work done by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows that the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed by the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians in Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until many years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was not disputed, I provide more quotes below.   \\\"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to God, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly clear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding from it.\\\"  -St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial Trinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)   \\\"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he is the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone loves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him'; and again it is written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the Holy Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel, that the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,' and that `He shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you.'\\\"  -Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)   \\\"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the appelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to the Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the Father,' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,' and `will receive of mine,' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the Son, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit divine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of the Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like soul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father and of the Son, a third by appelation....  \\\"The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit breathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor is the Spirit created.\\\"  -St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored, 8 and 75 (374 AD)   \\\"Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is it necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him, it is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary to speak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and the Son, His Sources.\\\"  -St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)   Thus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt, Palastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time, all have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine expressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church that they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus who all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is not enough to bring up the \\\"proceeds from the Father\\\" line of the Creed or the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.  But it does not say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son, only that He does proceed from the Father.\",\"[]   \\\"These LPT1, COM1, disk controller are call devices.

For example, if your Soundblaster wants to drive interrupt number 7, then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0 or 1 at all times, depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt. This precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7.

This is true perhaps only for the Lega Nord. The referendum Sunday is expected to establish a British/American style first-past-the-post system in the Senate.  If implemented, it would encourage a two- (or perhaps three-) party system in Italy. Most likely the DC and PSI will not be these parties; rather there will be a shakeup of the entire party structure from which 2 new parties will emerge to dominate.  Will Lega Nord be one of these?  Who knows.  (The Camera dei Deputati (lower house) will likely remain with Proportional Representation for a while, but there is talk of switching a portion of that house, too. Maybe as much as 40% first-past-the-post)  Overall, the electoral reform in Italy is a welcome change.  Italians are tired of having crappy government.  Porn stars, Pavarotti's and Hunters & Fishers won't gain seats because PR is dead.  A good two-party system will bring Italy efficient, accountable government.

The hard part is getting the radioactives to put in it.  Have you ever read Tom Clancy's _The Sum of All Fears_?  It describes in great detail how a Palestinian terrorist group constructed a nuclear bomb using stolen (actually found) plutonium, with some help from an East German nuclear physicist.  For some non fiction, read Tom Clancy's article _Five Minutes Till Midnight_.  It shows how a terrorist group could construct a nuke using Neptunium, a low grade radioactive waste product dumped in toxic waste sites and forgotten about.

Both the SDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's defense is basically nonmeasurable at present.  You can talk about how important calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls in the dirt.  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various catcher's rank in \\\"defense\\\".     Looking at Lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspect that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves (or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher?  As far as I can tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics (such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking the ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to clear that up is playing and practice time.  I can't see how repetitions at AAA are any better then reps in the majors!     All we're left with is the calling the game aspect.  Olsen  and Berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping the pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost all veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn the major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to learn Tom Glavine's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn't be supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over pitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But  given time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.   Now, since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major league pitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaring problem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he can't learn just as well while in the majors?  \",\" I'm not sure why you don't consider it an option.

Toss in  a glass break sensor, and shock sensor. Door lock and unlock, two remotes and panic feature are also nice to have.  Most important is where you have the installation done!

The pin outs on the CD-ROM line-out and the SB Pro CD-IN are not the same.  I am considering taking the RCA output jacks on the Mitsumi interface card and routing them to the line-in input on the SB Pro.  Will this work with multi-media software that uses the CD-ROM and the SB Pro or do I need to go to the CD-IN pins on the SB-Pro.

With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView. I put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage() is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the Sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory pixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that: (1) the X protocol communication is slowing things down; or (2) XPutImage is inefficient...or both! My question is, what is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to a window? Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is running on the same machine as the server? Or am I stuck with XPutImage() (in which case I might as well give up now...)?  All help appreciated...thanks!

Here's the outcome from the research (condenced versions, copyright San Jose Mercury news):  ---   Bombings in the two largest cities in southern Lebanon killed 11 people and  wounded 80 others. A car bomb blew up in Tyre, killing 10 people and wounding  75. A man was killed and five others seriously wounded in an explosion in  Nabatiye. ---   An Israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a rubber guerrilla boat off  southern Lebanon early today, killing the two men aboard, the army command  said.         It said in a communique that a Dvora patrol boat opened fire on the  motorized rubber dinghy north of Tyre after identifying it as hostile. The army  said no one on the Israeli boat was injured. The affiliation of the slain  guerrillas was not immediately known. ---   Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal  battled Sunday in Tyre, Lebanon, with machine guns and rocket-propelled  grenades, killing at least four people and wounding 15, police said. ---  Lebanon's mainstream Shiite Muslim militia said Thursday that it had  uncovered a network of tunnels in a southern Lebanese village where it said pro- Iranian kidnappers had held Western hostages.         Officials of the militia, Amal, led local journalists through the catacomb- like alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village,  Kawthariyet al Siyad, near Tyre, the ancient port city, about 40 miles south of  Beirut.         The officials said they were certain that U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R.  Higgins was detained there shortly after he was seized by gunmen on a road  outside Tyre in February 1988. -------------- ...anyway, I counted 20 articles during these 3 years of reporting. I also found out the possible reason why the numbers for the inhabitants of the city is defined between 14000 and 24000. It seems that Tyre is one of the places where people from Libanon flee to during more extensive bombings, so there's a constant flow of refugees entering and leaving Tyre (articles mentioned thousands of people entering and leaving this place).  I counted 0 articles for my home town, Kristinestad, so from now I will consider this place to be a fishing village :-).

Arafat explicitly *denies* this claim.   from a Libyan televison interview with Yasser Arafat 7-19-1991 Q: Some people say that the Palestinian revolution has many times changed    its strategies and tactics, something which has left its imprint on the    Palestinian problem and on the Palestinian Liberation Front.  The    [strategies and tactics] have not been clear.  The question is, is the    direction of the Palestinian problem clear?  The Palestinian leadership    has stopped, or at least this is what has been said in the media, this    happened on the way to the dialogue with the United States, the PLO    recognized something called \\\"Israel\\\"...  A: No, no, no!  We do not recognize the State of Israel.  We said    \\\"recognition\\\" -- when a Palestinian state is established.  It will then    decide if to recognize Israel or not.  When it is established, its    parliament will convene and decide.    And replace them with what?  If Israel is to withdraw its control of any territory, there must be two prerequsites.  One is that it leads to a reduction in deaths.  The second is that it should not weaken Israels bargianing position with respect to peace talks.   Leaving Gaza unilateraly is a bad idea because it encourages arabs to think they can get what they want by killing Jews.  The only way Israel should pull out of Gaza is at the end of negotiations. These negotiations should lead to a mutually agreeable solution with security guarantees for both sides.   Until arabs are ready to sit down at the table and talk again, they should not expect, or recieve more concessions.

It's at ftp.cica.indiana.edu, in /pub/pc/win3/uploads, titled simply bungee.zip.  Be sure to set your ftp connection to binary mode before downloading. If you have any other After Dark shareware/freeware modules, please upload them too.  The more the merrier.   Andrew --\",\"A few days ago I posted a question about trying to call a function which set up an X app multiple times.  It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize() should never be called more than once.  This helped.  However, I am still having some problems.  Below is a new little test program that more closely models my real program.  In the actual program, I am writing a library, callable from any other program.  This means that the first time the lib function is called, it must initialize things, and after that, it should just use the old stuff (still around because of static variables).  In the demo below, main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents the interface to the library function.  #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include <Xm/PushB.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h>  void bla(XtAppContext app, Widget top) {         Widget topone = top;  // in real prog, these are member vars         XtAppContext theapp = app; // of a class         int junk = 0;         Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, &junk,                                         NULL);          Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(\\\"blaaa\\\", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,                         topone,                         XmNheight, 50,                         XmNwidth, 50,                         NULL);          XtRealizeWidget(topone);         for (int i=0;i<=25;i++) // real prog returns when \\\"Exit\\\" button clicked         {                 XEvent event;                 XtAppNextEvent(theapp, &event);                 XtDispatchEvent(&event);         }         XtDestroyWidget(box);         XtCloseDisplay(dis); }  // SetItUp - should be called once only void SetItUp(XtAppContext *app, Widget *top) {         int junk = 0;         (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app, \\\"test\\\", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,                 NULL, NULL, 0); }  // doit - some library function callable from the outside void doit() {         static XtAppContext app; // use these every time called         static Widget top;          static int setup = 0;          if (!setup)         {                 SetItUp(&app, &top);                 setup = 1;         }         bla(app, top); }  // main - program which links to my library main() {         for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)         {                 doit();                 printf(\\\"sleeping...\\\\n\\\");//widget still on screen at this point                 sleep(5);         } }   The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created. (It is still on the screen -- unusuable -- during the \\\"sleep\\\" in the main prog, despite the XtDestroyWidget call).  Anyone see something I'm missing?  Thanks very much.

Maybe you missed it amidst the flurry of responses? Yet again, the use of this newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters they have substantial knowledge of.  For cites on MSG, look up almost anything by John W. Olney, a toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on development.  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an excitotoxic food additive, and that its major constituent, glutamate is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain (humans included).  Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrown off.  Glutamate and aspartate, also an excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts, and are freely available in many foods, but the amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single food.  By eating lots of junk food, packaged soups, and diet soft drinks, it is possible to jack your blood levels so high, that anyone with a sensitivity to these compounds will suffer numerous *real* physi9logical effects.  Read Olney's review paper in Prog. Brain Res, 1988, and check *his* sources. They are impecable. There is no dispute.\",\"This is turning into a FAQ   Here is how to violate your Quadra 700 warranty and install your own memory.  1)  Insert usual disclaimer here   2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and     hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static     precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do     this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back  of the mac.   3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the     tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.     The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the     tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may     also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power     supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you     need release.   4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon     SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable     leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.     The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed     to release it.                                              5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount  6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A     phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop     it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful     here.  7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the     right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding  posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then  lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.  8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM     slots.  9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to     gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their  chips facing the front of the motherboard.       The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in  sets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely  and firmly into a fully upright position.   10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the     tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about  1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into  place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.     Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks     into place.   11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY     DRIVE CABLE.  12) Replace the phillips head screw  13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.  14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount\",\" : >Hi, it's an *easy* question for you Windows gurus.

Have any of you read Tony Campollo's book- liar,  ->lunatic, or the real thing?  (I might be a little off on the title, but he  ->writes the book.  Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity,  ->in the process he became a Christian himself.  Sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy.  Just what organization did he  belong to? Does it have a name?  -> The book says that Jesus was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a  ->modern day Koresh) or he was actually who he said he was.  Logic alert - artificial trifercation.  The are many other possible explainations.  Could have been that he never existed.  There have been some good points made in this group that is not  impossible  that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths, Mithra comes to mind.  -> Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.  Who would  ->die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People  ->gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing  ->someone who was or had been healed.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did  ->heal people.     Logic alert -  argument from incredulity.  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn't mean that it isn't true.  Liars can be very pursuasive, just look at Koresh that you yourself site. He has followers that don't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die. By not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what  he believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more  that faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling, so the stories got bigger to appeal better.  -> Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn  ->to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example  ->anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see  ->this right away. -> Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the  ->real thing.     Or might not have existed, or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, because in the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are  possible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives.  However, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the  incomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at  least one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one of the other two alternative is no longer valid.  -> Some other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in  ->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal  ->and Crucifixion.  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I  ->write I will use it.  JC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn't be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.  What would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then,  yet  fullfilled them anyway.  -> I don't think most people understand what a Christian is.  It  ->is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.  Rather I think it  ->should be a way of life, and a total sacrafice of everything for God's  ->sake.  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the  ->same.  Hey we can't do it, God himself inspires us to turn our lives  ->over to him.  That's tuff and most people don't want to do it, to be a  ->real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at.  But  ->just like weight lifting or guitar playing, drums, whatever it takes  ->time.  We don't rush it in one day, Christianity is your whole life.   ->It is not going to church once a week, or helping poor people once in  ->a while.  We box everything into time units.  Such as work at this  ->time, sports, Tv, social life.  God is above these boxes and should be  ->carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for  ->ourselves.    Here I agree with you.  Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says  seriously, and what it says is that it must be a total way of life.  I have very little respect for  Xians that don't.  If the myth is true, then it is true in its entirity.  The picking and choosing that I see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

And so, by their own choice, they will remain in darkness, sort of like bugs under a rock.  However, some people, but not many, will not like the darkness.  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable. These people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blinded at first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.  And, after a while, now that they can see things for what they really are, they will also see the heights which they can reach, and the places they can go, and they will learn to choose their own paths through the world, and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their successes.  They will see that there is much much more to the world than just the narrow experiences under the rock.  They will discover that life under a rock was incredibly yucky, and that life on their own terms is great -- so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it.  Do you see my point?  I think you're the one under the rock, and I'm getting a great tan out here in the sunlight.  My life has improved immesurably since I abandoned theism -- come and join me!  It will be a difficult trip at first, until you build up your muscles for the long hike, but it's well worth it!   Look, you just practically equated Odin and Zeus?  They're as much different as your god is from them...  Don't you see?  I'm not going to accept ANYTHING that I can't witness with my own eyes or experience with my own senses, especially not something as mega-powerful as what you're trying to get me to accept. Surely if you believe in it this strongly, you must have a good *reason* to, don't you?   When did I say that?  I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead of being subject to the whims of a deity, but that if the deity decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am, then so be it.   Nope -- most people are Christian.  Most people are fond of feeling that they are imperfect, of believing that the world is an undesirable place, of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and holy again, of doing just as their priests tell them, like good little sheep.  You enjoy darkness, and you're proud of it.  You may know the Bible well -- but have you read any of the Koran?  Or Zen writings?  Or Hare Krishna literature?  If you haven't, then how can you say you have an open mind?   Nope.  You make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your failures; then you die.  If you are content with the life you've led as you reflect back on it in your final moments, then you've led a good life.   Please do.   I'm sorry, I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god I'd worship would do, unless the sacrifice was only temporary, in which case it's not really all that important.  Forget the Bible for a minute.  Forget quoting verses, forget about who said what about this or that.  *Show me.*  Picture just you and me and a wide open hilltop, and convince me that you're right. \",\"HI, I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related subjects.

It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim to know what God thinks/wants. Especially when it's based upon your interpretation of a book. The logic in the above statement is faulty in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can't both be correct. It's all about perception. No two people are exactly alike. No two people perceive everything in the same way. I believe that there is one truth. Call it God's truth, a universal truth, or call it what you will. I don't believe God presents this truth. I think it is just there and it's up to you to look for and see it, through prayer, meditation, inspir- ation, dreams or whatever. Just because people may perceive this truth differently, it doesn't mean one is wrong and the other is right. As an example, take the question, \\\"Is the glass half empty or half full\\\"? You can have two different answers which are contradictory and yet both are correct.

(Of course these could all be wrong.....)   from                        THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                Dorothy Denning                            Revised, April 21, 1993  . . .  The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  . . .  ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.  Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,   which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed.  ------------------  suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip, but did not know F, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from if law enforcement field     E[E[K; U] + N; F] not knowing N would might make this much harder.  Now suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not), If I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know U for a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for the other party.  If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field, since I could make my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also allows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are saying but I could know who you are saying it too.  Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of messages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the key generation method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that matter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U's will be chosen from know weak keys for the system.  Obviously the compromise of F would be a disaster, both to law enforcement for whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that it is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot of people (more then 1) know what it is (and if some \\\"panel of experts\\\" is going to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forget grinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.

I've got some specimen CELP code but it's not obvious that it runs in real time; I think it's just proof-of- concept code, and I have some mucking about with file formats to do before I can put my own sample through it.  Looks like the current option is to use a voice-mail modem with built-in DSP chip to do this in hardware.  That means two modems for a system, putting the cost at $600 upwards.  Ouch.  Maybe soon we'll be able to do it in software on high-powered games consoles - isn't the 3DO an Acorn RISC machine inside?  That cpu runs like shit off a shovel... and will be nicely mass-market too.\",\" Then don't complain (maybe it wasn't you) that SCSI was so expensive on PC's because all we've had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus. (ie no one buys SCSI for ISA because ISA is slow) Are you saying that SCSI on an ISA bus is not an automatic winner when compared to IDE?   I get different transfer rates out of my IDE when I change my ISA bus speed.   IDE is just a variant of the old IBM- MFM AT controller.  (at least that's how it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different platforms.  Is there any argument that  IDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the drive is able to provide the data?  Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface (because of a higher RPM platter, different arrangement of heads, etc?)?   If data is going from one drive to another, and if SCSI has the ability to perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main memory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know, IDE can't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored in main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives  at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the same time?  Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA (or whatever) bus?   A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that's 245 million bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface, he gets close to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers?   So you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type, considering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or tape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and run DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives at the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years ago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice.   But on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you get more performance for the money.  For all the people that will only have a single hard drive in their system (regardless of the OS) will the SCSI choice really give them more performance than IDE?   True, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option is there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.   No argument.  This is always held up to the first time SCSI buyer as the best reason.  But how many SCSI devices will the first time SCSI buyer eventually acquire?  Again does it make sense to go SCSI for a single hard drive system?   With all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs, are you really sure that PC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible?  And even if they are,  is the data accessible from either machine (ie are there no formatting/ partitioning or file table differences?)  Is it really plug'n'play?   So the C: drive on the connor becomes a logical D: drive to DOS.  Is this really a problem?     After having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers, I have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor have I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or to/from the same drive.   That is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up).  I do believe that there is the possibility for up to 4 IDE drives on a PC. \",\"AllThe Devil ReincarnateSWR meter for CB radios  TD>From: ssave@ole.cdac.com (The Devil Reincarnate) TD>Organization: CDAC, WA TD>What TD>is a good choice for a CB? 1/4 or 1/8 wave? TD>  I read the installation instructions on a 1/4 wave antenna, TD>and they suggested that I use an SWR to tune it at channel 12 TD>and channel 32 for a minimum reading.  Question is, why channel TD>12 and 32?  The best antenna is one that will let out the most wave (probably not the  best explanation, but the rest makes sense) A one wave will cancell itself  out (BTW no such beastie) . The best is a 1/2 wave antenna, followed by  1/4, then 1/8 etc.  As for SWRing in, what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct  length for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on. Since the  wavelength varies with the channel you use, then it's recommended to SWR  in using the middle channel of those you are going to use. Anyway in the beginning of CB's, all new antennas had to be SWR'ed in,  nowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on, so that there's not  much point in SWRing. Then again you may be a fanatic and whish to do it  anyway.\",\":You are loosing.  \\\"Loosing\\\"?

The Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens.  That means if the Isles beat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.   However, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in general that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders  back-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that  the Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period, come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable how many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty  wide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played  a golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL  debut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this  guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a  Mahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it's because the Isles don't shoot  correctly.  Has anyone else noticed this?   Also, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick Vukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey talent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the puck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties.  Richard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he's a defenseman.  He's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus.  This guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \\\"enforcers\\\"?  Not only do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are really trying to play the game.  I'll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a  good fight once in a while, but only when it's \\\"called for\\\".  You know, when a guy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of \\\"hockey ethics\\\" might cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are losing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees need to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already.  I'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the referee doesn't call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy, not physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost.  If you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to pull a guy down to prevent it, you don't deserve to win in the first place.  Just My Honest Opinion,\",\"# >...

Generally, these telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, for example, we have the following set regarding children:   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to   the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum   [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem   families and received as servants when they are left alone through   the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect   all such children in your province and send them to the places of   deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to   the people.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [1]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the   time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their   lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.      Minister of the Interior,       Talaat\\\" [2]   \\\"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.    November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the   orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their   places of exile.        Abdullahad Nuri. [3]    \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been   opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is   done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt   of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or   any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it   purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as   detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received   into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish   special orphanages for them.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat.\\\" [4]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.     Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures   to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with   the caravans.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [5]   \\\"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.    At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows   of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is   not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by   Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble   in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned   out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of   deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent   away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [6]  In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \\\"rationalizing\\\" this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:   \\\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for   its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks   it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I   shall die for it.\\\" [7]   These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never questioned these \\\"death march orders\\\" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.  For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.  If one were to examine the sample \\\"authentic text\\\" provided in the Turkish  Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it  too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the  Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or  Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery.   Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul, Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide  architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a  heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.  This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian.     - - - references - - -  [1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60  [2] ibid, page 60  [3] ibid, page 60  [4] ibid, page 61  [5] ibid, page 61  [6] ibid, page 62  [7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and     London), 1926, page 387  \",\"  I second that.

Avoid things that would plug her up.  Crohn's has no dietary restriction in general.   The feeling obout this has changed in the GI community.  The current feeling is that inflammation is not induced by food.  There is even evidence that patients deprived of food have mucosal atrophy due to lack of stimulation of intestinal growth factors.  There is now interest in providing small amounts of nasogastric feeding to patients on IV nutrition.  But I digress.   Symptoms can be drastically enhanced by food, but not inflammation.   The low residue diet is appropriate for you if you still have obstructions. Again, it is not felt that food causes inflammation.  These foods are avoided because they may get stuck.  I'd go ahead and have the fudge, though ;-)  .  Spencer makes an especially good point in having an observant and informed patient.  Would that many patients be able to tell what causes them problems.  The digestive processing idea is changing, but if a food causes problems, avoid them.  Be sure that the foods are  tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.  Crohn's commonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with severly restricted diets that take months to renormalize.  There was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussed the issue of dietary restriction of fiber.  It would be worth reading to anyone with an interest in Crohn's.  And, as I always say when dealing with Crohn's, as does Spencer, Good Luck!\",\"frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer) writes ...  While I'll agree that these are generally held to be \\\"good things\\\", I question whether they come very close to being objective values. Especially considering that at one time or another each has been viewed as being undesirable.  I doubt you could even come up with anything that could be said to be universally \\\"good\\\" or \\\"bad\\\".  And when I referred to \\\"the truth\\\" I was using the term hypothetically, realizing full well that there may not even be such a thing.   True enough.  But they cannot be said to be anything more than personal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any sense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some \\\"higher authority\\\" (aka, absolute moral truth).   An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth? Interesting notion.   :-)  Certainly one can have as one's morals a belief that compromise is good.  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most people do very successfully.  I suppose one could hold compromise as being an absolute moral, but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?   Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying a commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long & healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most agressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulating production.  The equation is always more complex than presented. To characterize relative morals as merely following one's own conscience / desires is to unduly simplify it. \",\" JB>    RR> \\\"I don't doubt that the placebo effect is alive and well with JB>    RR>  EVERY medical modality - estimated by some to be around 20+%, JB>    RR>  but why would it be higher with alternative versus conventional JB>    RR>  medicine?\\\" JB>   JB>  Because most the the time, closer to 90% in my experience, there is no JB>  substance to the 'alternative' intervention beyond the good intentions of the JB>  practitioner, which in itself is quite therapeutic.

If someone runs a medical practice with only a 10% success rate,    they either tackle problems for which they are not qualified to    treat, or they have no conscience and are only in business for    fraudulent purposes.

However, i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who have the right for it.  As for the Arabian and Palestinean voices that are against the current negotiations and the so-called peace process, they are not against peace per se, but rather for their well-founded predictions that Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank (and most probably the same for Golan Heights) back to the Arabs. An 18 months of \\\"negotiations\\\" in Madrid, and Washington proved these predictions. Now many will jump on me saying why are you blaming israelis for no-result negotiations.

He is only insurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcher is injured during a game.     So to free up this roster spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever, why not invoke a catcher re-substitution rule:  If the last roster catcher on a team is injured during a game, the team is permitted to substitute in his place for defensive purposes a catcher who has previously been yanked from the game.

During WWII, the British managed to supply arms to the Yugoslavs despite German occupation.  If the Europeans had the will to do anything besides sponsoring peace conferences, they would have no problem putting any kind of weapon they wanted into Bosnia.  I guess I would favor ending the embargo if the Congress would pass a law forbidding export of US military supplies to Yugoslavia, including via third parties.  Until then the risks of the US being drawn into a more active role would be too great.  I do not see the arms embargo as a major factor in the outcome of the war.   Both sides are certainly not equal in the eyes of the press.  And that's about all we have to go on, isn't it?    And I wish you'd quit hurling words like racist around.

Some 'tips and techniques' are included here:   I found that I needed some smaller sockets to undo the shocks. And a can of WD40 helped...  The sockets needed were metric (exact fit) but I was able to use some SAE sockets...  13/16 and 15/16 are rather close to 21 and 24mm... It CAN be fun having a Canadian Ford ...   Didn't have to undo the end bolts/bushings.  Just the 2 U bolts on each side and the shock absorber.  Jacking up the frame some more (had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden  platform on top of that to get the 'floor jack' high enough to raise the frame ... I't one TALLL truck...) lifted the spring free of the axel.  Taking out the block gave me enough room to undo the pin holding the spring pack together.  The spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head on the other end....  No wrench head...  Vice Grips worked fine... I soaked the nut with WD40 and it came right off.  Flipped the bottom spring and then...   I donno ... I'm a little more sore today than after working on a 1911A1 ...  A 1.5 foot pipe cheater was a real help.  Torque spec for the U bolt nuts is 150 to 200 ft-lbs (!).   A 1911-A1 doesn't have that kind of torque spec ...  It was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring pack.   Squeeze pack with two hands, hold bolt with third, put nut on with fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth and sixth hands ...  I used some string to tie the pack together while holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let go to get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.  Getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too... until I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and/or 2) rolled forward.  One the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential tilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right hole.  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling forward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up.  Spent more than an hour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block with levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a  break and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore (since it HAD been lined up before, and *I* didn't move it, something ELSE must  have ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move  it back... hmmm...).  After that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.  BTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for. At least it now sits level..  --   E.

Then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the faces sharing a given edge (where an edge is two integers representing the two shared vertices).  Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE.  Using the edge dictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of this face.  And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistently orienting the entire surface.  Find the average of the vertices in this surface.  Using that point, calculate a volume measurement, taking into account the face's orientation.  If the volume turns out to be positive, assume the faces are oriented correctly.  If it is negative, reverse their orientations (mark them CLOCKWISE).  If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this, choose another face and go through the algorithm again.  At the end, faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversed before facet normals are found.

(remembering that good humor always dances uncomfortably close to the truth)   I can't wait to see the inevitable flames.  :-) \",\"Thanks to all those people who recommended Workspace managers for Windows 3.1.  I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia's MS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some sites in the U.S.  The three I found were:  1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)                                 This was the smallest and simplest    of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.    It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra    button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the    title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press    a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would    have been nice if there was an \\\"ALWAYS ON TOP\\\" setting for the little    window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified    strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be    a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace    manager makes it an attractive package.  2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)                                While this workspace manager offered a    few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming    to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace    is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take \\\"snapshots\\\"    of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what     applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,    but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.    With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in    a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this    viewing functionality which is quite useful.  3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)                             This is an interesting package, which contains    a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies    include \\\"Backmenu\\\", which provides a pop-up root menu when you    press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu    is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,    which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could    say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also    bundled in \\\"backdesk.zip\\\" is a program called \\\"WRUN\\\", which allows    you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS    instead of using the File Manager to run applications.      The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite    differently to the other two workspace managers in that it    doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.    In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,    and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to    focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different    viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which    each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window    allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically    the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area    while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up    of a particular section.\",\" HMMM... that brings up a neat idea.

I think this is going to be a tough measure to fight, since the Government has invested a lot of resources in developing this high-profile initiative.  They are serious about it now.  It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate Bill 266 in 1991.  Possible actions to take in response:  1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, and more.  2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and technology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet, write some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or newspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea.  Remember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be slow to grasp why it's a bad idea, since it seems so technical and arcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one.   3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your Member of Congress in your own district, as well as your two US Senators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of technology issues.  Talk to those aides.  4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party would certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings of the Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a surprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the political spectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other activist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government that can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play themselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you want to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues.  4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assuming these groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal expenses and lobbying.  5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably develop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be lobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a telecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then present your company's management with a united front of engineering talent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your management, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold meetings on it.  6)  Publicize, deploy and entrench as much guerrilla techno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That means PGP, anonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP, PGP key servers, etc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might also be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed by Government action.  I will also be working to develop new useful tools for these purposes.   7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on this topic.  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be, so we may have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can't outright defeat it, we may have to live with a modified version of this Clipper chip plan in the end.  So we'd better be prepared to analyze the Government's plan, and articulate how we want it modified. \",\" I have a long sighted eye and a short sighted eye.

Similarly, a company called Red Hot Television is broadcasting pornographic material which can be received in Britain.  If they were broadcasting in Britain, they would be committing a crime.  But they are not, they are broadcasting from Denmark, so the British Government is powerless to do anything about it, in spite of the apparent law-breaking.

More confusingly, I could be right in some countries but not in others... \",\"I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly, (motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only \\\"real solution\\\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both  legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the \\\"internal nerves\\\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd  always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that \\\"force\\\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.  Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\",\" So what's your point?  Mark's comment still is valid.  To suggest that AIDS is \\\"deserved\\\" IS ludicrous.  I sin.  I can resolve to abstain from  sin, and do weekly (more often, actually).  Yet I routinely fail. I surely do deserve what I get, yet God compassionately provided  the Incarnate Logos, Jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation. If AIDS is deserved, I surely deserve instant death just as much, as do we all, as St. Paul so cogently remids us.  To willingly judge \\\"others\\\" as deserving punishment seems to me to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.      So what's the point here?  I can get AIDS and NEVER engage in \\\"deviant\\\" sexual behavior.  In fact, I could engage in LOTS of deviant sexual behavior with HIV+ people and never be infected.  AIDS is a consequence of particular behaviors, many of which are not sexual.  And not all sexual behaviors carry the risk of transmission.      The end of all things is to know, love and serve God, growing daily closer through prayer, meditation and discipline.  Even so I could get AIDS.

That's *your* *interpretation* of these texts.   2 Peter 1:20-21 But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter  of one's own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.  The study notes in my Bible offer three possible meanings for verse 20. Apparantly it's not as clear to Charles Ryrie as it is to you.  2 Timothy 3:16-17 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.  Galations 1:11-12 For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.  For I neither received it from man,  nor was I taught it, but I receieved it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.  When I read these passages, it was not immediately clear to me what every phrase meant.  I had stop and think about the possible connotations of words, what the intent of the author may have been, wonder if the translator used the correct English word to convey the  same meaning: I had to interpret.  If you want to believe that your  are not interpreting Scripture as you read, there's probably nothing  I can say to change your mind.  But I think it's naive to think that  our culture, experiences, education, do not affect everything we read.   In college, I took an entire course in Biblical interpretation.

The two-day program, cosponsored by the library and Baltimore Hebrew University, with additional support from the Project Judaica Foundation, will be held in the library's Mumford Room, sixth floor, Madison Building.    Seating is limited, and admission to any session of the symposium must be requested in writing (see Note A).    The symposium will be held one week before the public opening of a major exhibition, \\\"Scrolls from the Dead Sea: The Ancient Library of Qumran and Modern Scholarship,\\\" that opens at the Library of Congress on April 29.  On view will be fragmentary scrolls and archaeological artifacts excavated at Qumran, on loan from the Israel Antiquities Authority.  Approximately 50 items from Library of Congress special collections will augment these materials.  The exhibition, on view in the Madison Gallery, through Aug. 1, is made possible by a generous gift from the Project Judaica Foundation of Washington, D.C.    The Dead Sea Scrolls have been the focus of public and scholarly interest since 1947, when they were discovered in the desert 13 miles east of Jerusalem.  The symposium will explore the origin and meaning of the scrolls and current scholarship.  Scholars from diverse academic backgrounds and religious affiliations, will offer their disparate views, ensuring a lively discussion.    The symposium schedule includes opening remarks on April 21, at 2 p.m., by Librarian of Congress James H. Billington, and by Dr. Norma Furst, president, Baltimore Hebrew University.  Co-chairing the symposium are Joseph Baumgarten, professor of Rabbinic Literature and Institutions, Baltimore Hebrew University and Michael Grunberger, head, Hebraic Section, Library of Congress.    Geza Vermes, professor emeritus of Jewish studies, Oxford University, will give the keynote address on the current state of scroll research, focusing on where we stand today. On the second day, the closing address will be given by Shmaryahu Talmon, who will propose a research agenda, picking up the theme of how the Qumran studies might proceed.    On Wednesday, April 21, other speakers will include:     -- Eugene Ulrich, professor of Hebrew Scriptures, University of Notre Dame and chief editor, Biblical Scrolls from Qumran, on \\\"The Bible at Qumran;\\\"    -- Michael Stone, National Endowment for the Humanities distinguished visiting professor of religious studies, University of Richmond, on \\\"The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Pseudepigrapha.\\\"    -- From 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. a special preview of the exhibition will be given to symposium participants and guests.     On Thursday, April 22, beginning at 9 a.m., speakers will include:     -- Magen Broshi, curator, shrine of the Book, Israel Museum, Jerusalem, on \\\"Qumran: The Archaeological Evidence;\\\"    -- P. Kyle McCarter, Albright professor of Biblical and ancient near Eastern studies, The Johns Hopkins University, on \\\"The Copper Scroll;\\\"    -- Lawrence H. Schiffman, professor of Hebrew and Judaic studies, New York University, on \\\"The Dead Sea Scrolls and the History of Judaism;\\\" and    -- James VanderKam, professor of theology, University of Notre Dame, on \\\"Messianism in the Scrolls and in Early Christianity.\\\"     The Thursday afternoon sessions, at 1:30 p.m., include:     -- Devorah Dimant, associate professor of Bible and Ancient Jewish Thought, University of Haifa, on \\\"Qumran Manuscripts: Library of a Jewish Community;\\\"    -- Norman Golb, Rosenberger professor of Jewish history and civilization, Oriental Institute, University of Chicago, on \\\"The Current Status of the Jerusalem Origin of the Scrolls;\\\"    -- Shmaryahu Talmon, J.L. Magnas professor emeritus of Biblical studies, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, on \\\"The Essential 'Commune of the Renewed Covenant': How Should Qumran Studies Proceed?\\\" will close the symposium.     There will be ample time for question and answer periods at the end of each session.     Also on Wednesday, April 21, at 11 a.m.:    The Library of Congress and The Israel Antiquities Authority will hold a lecture by Esther Boyd-Alkalay, consulting conservator, Israel Antiquities Authority, on \\\"Preserving the Dead Sea Scrolls\\\" in the Mumford Room, LM-649, James Madison Memorial Building, The Library of Congress, 101 Independence Ave., S.E., Washington, D.C.     ------    NOTE A: For more information about admission to the symposium, please contact, in writing, Dr. Michael Grunberger, head, Hebraic Section, African and Middle Eastern Division, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540.  -30-\",\"Well, it looks like the folks in soc.religion.islam have loosened up a bit and are discussing this topic as well as the banking/interest topic.  A few books on the subject have also been mentioned in addition to the one you mentioned.  These may be hard to find, but I think I may take a stab at it out of curiosity.  I know the one film I saw on this subject was pretty weak and the only two quotes I have seen which were used to show science in the Koran (which I posted here) were also pretty  vague.  I suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the quotes they have.  At least one poster on the Islam channel seems to have some misgivings about the practice of using the Koran to decide what is good science.  I wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians \\\"Creation Science\\\" on any topic.  It would be interesting to find a history of scientific interpretations of the Koran, to see if anyone used the Koran to support earlier science which has since been discarded.  It is all too easy to look at science as it exists today and then \\\"interpret\\\" passages to match those findings.  People do similar things with the sayings of Nostradamus all the time.\",\" Reflex sympathetic dystrophy.

Here you admit that you have no alternative, no possible basis for the claim that there is anything other than reason or that reason is inapplicable in religious knowledge, except possibly that reason conflicts with \\\"religious knowledge\\\".

A couple of years I was involved in a low-speed getoff in which I landed on my back on the pavement.  My head (helmeted) hit the pavement with a \\\"clunk\\\", leaving a couple of dings and chips in the paint at the point of impact, but no other visible damage.  I called the helmet manufacturer and inquired about damage.  They said that the way a fiberglass shell works is to first give, then delaminate, then crack. This is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a wider area.  After the fiberglass has done its thing, the crushable foam liner takes care of absorbing (hopefully) the remaining impact force. They told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality (delamination of the glass/resin layers) can occur with NO visible signs, either inside or outside of the helmet.  They suggested that I send them the helmet and they would inspect it (including X-raying).  I did so.  They sent back the helmet with a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would compromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection. (I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim prior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.)  The bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integrity can be compromised with no visible signs.  The only way to know for sure is to send it back and have it inspected.  Note that some helmet manufacturers provide inspections services and some do not.  Another point to consider when purchasing a lid. \",\" I don't think anyone is arguing that there would be no effect. But there would be no _net_ _positive_ effect. You also have to  consider the negative side: Law abiding citizens, armed with  fireamrs (pistols for the most part), prevent between 80,000 (National Crime Survey) and 1,000,000 (Dr. Kleck) crimes each year. (Those are the extremes. Most studies find the number to be 500,000 to 600,000.) About 1% of those crimes are homicides, so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately 5,000 lives each year. There are roughly 12,000 criminal homicides and fatal accidents involving guns each year. For there to  be any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measures would disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns. That would be very hard to do: According the the federal BATF, only 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Since gun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legal sales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed, law-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on armed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.)  That doesn't sound like a net benefit to me.     Since most were with licensed weapons, I assume you are not supporting \\\"reasonable\\\" laws (i.e. waiting periods, background checks, licenses, etc...). Since only a complete ban would  alter the statistic you refer to, I assume that's what you are supporting.  By the way, 1135 people dies in 1986 from falling down stairs. 250 accidental handgun deaths isn't significant next to  other household accidents.   1080 children under the age of 10 died by drowning, 69 from  drinking poisonous household chemicals (like Drano), 139 from falls. If the real goal is to reduce the tragic, accidental deaths of children, wouldn't a ban on drain cleaners be a  better palce to start? (Or, perhaps, restricting ownership to professionals like plumbers?)   While you might call it \\\"emphasis\\\", refering to completely two statistics in the same sentence _implies_ a comparison. If it isn't valid, and you put the numbers together to convince people you are right, the kindest thing I could call it is propaganda.\",\" Actually, they won't.  What they'll tell you is that if you add up the number of suicides, murders of one drug dealer by another, legit self-defenses of a battered spouse, and so on, you'll end up with a number that is much larger than the number of self-defense killings against strangers committed in the bedroom.  (BTW - they didn't honestly count the latter either, but let's not quibble.)  They try to claim that comparison is between the costs of self-defense and the benefits, but they're wrong.  This comparison doesn't measure the costs of self-defense and it doesn't measure the benefits either.  For example, the goal is not to kill the attacker, whatever your relationship to him, but to stop him. While the number of killings may be proportional to the number of stops, it isn't equal.  Anyone who confuses that comparison with an honest evaluation is either lying or....  -andy\",\"Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. \",\"Second Wave makes NuBus card cages that work on the PDS slots of at least three Macs: the SE/30, IIsi and Centris 610.

The hardware will automagically wrap IRQ2 to IRQ9 on AT class machines (eg, anything with high IRQs). This is what I'm doing on my set up right now.     I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software), COM1 on IRQ3, SoundBlaster on IRQ5, LPT1 on IRQ7, and my ATI BusMouse port on one of the interrupts in between. Works just great.    If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that details how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the higher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.    It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9.

The IR source could be emitting a signature; I'm leaning toward 30 KHz square wave with 50% duty cycle.  I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic Inc. to give information to a pan/tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the angles.  For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LED(s), possibly an Optek OP290 or Motorola MLED81.  Wazing would mean at least 1 Amp current pulses.  At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to 10% and I would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the 50% required.

The original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print GrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer (and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible).  This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to Apple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.  SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour version, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).  There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older computers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult  time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).  Just one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to do so, whatever Mac you were using.

As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice. They showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as hydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman constant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out of kilter, and you get sick and die.  I've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real life.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this book, I would imagine you would have to:  1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy    water.  2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other    molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.  During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and eventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the water the victim ingested was heavy.  You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both alarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly begin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real story here.  Come to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was no longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.  The most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids would literally be \\\"heavy\\\".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and heavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by about 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that the victim's urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test involving the specific gravity of a body fluid?

My apology.     (Deletion)     So? No fun, but I must have met the minority then. And \\\"given by god\\\" refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something.     Rob, I am not intimate with Jewish theology, but I understand that you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god views, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute evil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.     (Deletion)   The context was metaphysics, even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent, the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion. I wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system.     (Deletion)   Is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds. The context is repulsive, and it is foul play, IMO, to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book.     (Big deletion)   No, not the interpretation of some laws, but the interpretation of the bible. As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue with god. The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo- logic question) is proof of a theology used.       It is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection between the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of it, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better. You might answer that one can't becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but that holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place? Can't it be replaced somehow? Is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other message that is included as well?     (Deletion)   Sorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system.   (Deletion)   If we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?     And the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it can be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way, and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god.\",\"From article <93111.225707PP3903A@auvm.american.edu>, by Paul H.

Did you ever read newspaper at all?   \\\"PAINFUL SEARCH ..\\\"  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \\\"Hojali Disaster\\\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \\\"We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\\\" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. \\\"We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.\\\"  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. \\\"Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\\\" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. \\\"This  is just a small percentage of the dead,\\\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. \\\"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.\\\"  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  \\\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\\\" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  \\\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.\\\"  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.  THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92   HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES  AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.  \\\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\\\" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. \\\"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive.\\\"  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  \\\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  \\\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother.  \\\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\\\" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \\\"We have never got any of the bodies back.\\\"  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  \\\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\\\" Mr Sadikov said. \\\"I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock.\\\"  Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all that.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.  Joe Buehler  ...  Schism and Disobedience  According to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the Church united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.  The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection of the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend \\\"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\\\"  It adds that \\\"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\\\"Not only does Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command, but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and his intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \\\"We pray for the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations last June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he is a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor heresy.\\\"  ...  Intrinsically Schismatic?  The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is not true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917 Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope, that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman Pontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the Church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in response.  It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The first part deals with \\\"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the Church\\\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the Church.  But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" which is entitled \\\"Usurpation of Ecclesial Functions and Offenses in their Exercise\\\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is Canon 1382, which reads: \\\"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication reserved to the Holy See.\\\"  The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder.  I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father Patrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs actuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel Church.  Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to      The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not     in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with     offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses     against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are     apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a     pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the     exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the     consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh     Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated     he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because     there was no intention of a breach with the Church.  ....  It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy, and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon Law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred excommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the Church and the salvation of souls.  Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce Association, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he knows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and the Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February 1989 Remnant merits careful study:\",\"The following items are for sale:  1)      ONKYO TX-901/910 reciever/amplifier.

I've refrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with the OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to say something.  Many things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightest suggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the Gospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death of Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to break down these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  If Moslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't kill them.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions. There are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under attack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are living together peacefully.  The precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two different things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into Canaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have promised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be a holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those attacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be defeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in Joshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was possible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once that was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were expected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of agreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted Bosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior would have disqualified this from being a holy war.  The other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by Assyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel for her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a judgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay of the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because illness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God for good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn't justify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that in attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as *unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God's people, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were actually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action. Furthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are judgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, through his prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets to Bosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting, I am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But that doesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it from judgement.\",\"   There is no notion of heliocentric, or even galacticentric either.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\",\"} >I'd have to say the most impressive HRs I've ever see came from Dave Kingman } >and his infamous moon-raker drives... }  } I remember one he hit circa 1976 at Wrigley Field that went across } the street (in dead center field) and hit a house on the roof.

Windows will use a swap file larger than the recommended size.  Last summer I went to a Microsoft Windows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information that the general public might not be aware of.  Anyway in the main book they handed out they have a section on \\\"Creating larger than recommended swapfile\\\".  I'll quote the information    If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size, you   will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything   larger than the recommended size.

Official history says that  the first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi  party, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red herring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of  the histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using  homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that Hitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse official history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts right. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in a coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of homosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it is possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubt it - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his former right hand man was a homosexual?).   Anyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references  to the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the  night of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even  the Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case,  this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the  1920's.   Ah, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the paranoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with  homosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know  what tainted \\\"evidence\\\" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made  by persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those  accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the  1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in  time and plant \\\"tainted\\\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers  which were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being  obvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter do you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in  these matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a  false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point  here seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof  falls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework  before making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.   This is just about the *only* thing we agree on.   I suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and  his SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this must be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what lies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If  you really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them  and ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from  their footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and tracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my specialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my time trying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.   Given that you already consider all evidence \\\"tainted\\\", what on earth would constitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been considered \\\"shrewd guesses\\\"?  I suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) - historians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious  footnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually  provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place  to start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.  I'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already.

I believe I discussed countersteering a horse before.  Basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins under his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit (which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).

Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5.  Monday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial.  Synopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that Randy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National Firearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.  The testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently ended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither by KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.  The day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley, who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person named Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms in his dealings with Randy Weaver.  Fadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an Aryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two then met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in time) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons transaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, \\\"He felt like he (Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the White cause.\\\"  The two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and later went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second meeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to tape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12- gauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of 19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge shotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of 24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel length and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver is reported to have said that he could perform better work once his machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility of future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars for the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty dollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have simply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 - over a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).  The next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that his \\\"source\\\" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead of the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaver suspected he was dealing with an informant, \\\"I had a guy in Spokane tell me you were bad.\\\"  Fadeley managed to convince Weaver otherwise.  The _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were made of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these meetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also reported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki Weaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There must have also been phone taps.  These tapes were played to the court via both headphones and loudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver's attorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to make sure that the government proved its case, \\\"...if it has a case at all...\\\" according to the rules.  Randy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his wife's voice on the tape.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect this trial is not explained.  Other notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning Kevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are surprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were surprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained in the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy Weaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that Harris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report that the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming at Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics are charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the only non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and Deputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that Harris's survival is simply due to divine intervention.\",\"In the mist of the Rangers soap box (i.e. Captain neMesis-ier/ex-coach  Roger Nebula bad blood bath) and with high hopes turned to new coach  Mr. Klean (Commissar Keenan)...

I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the *process* of science and the end result.    As an end result of science, one wants to get results that are objectively verifiable.  But there is nothing objective about the *process* of science.    If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information. But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This is where you and I disagree with Turpin.  In order to have science, one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypotheses.  Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, but they are merely the culmination of scientific research.  The most important part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING.   Without this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing.  (No, hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data. Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or looking out the window.  At least not unless you've done a lot of really good thinking beforehand.)    The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology.   It depends on the quality of their THINKING.    It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies.  And it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such as certain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all,  but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses.    And I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes.  Simply avoiding mistakes doesn't get you anywhere.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"Are you (two) joking? Is the entire Internet flaming you (two)? Ahh!, now I remember that Ohmite company was the first introducing \\\"the pink colored resistor\\\", only for electronics working females ;-)\",\"  My knowledge about driving in the U.S. is also second-hand, but I think I can correct your statements about our Autobahn:   Oh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I've heard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg- ressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car at the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that he grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in Germany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic). What you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due to fear':  When driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the majority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody fails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can go (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :). So any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex- posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to handle it - or you lose...  That's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation -  whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to the volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more people (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened) and each accident is one accident too much.   Better designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto- bahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word -  a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high); those guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals can crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is that esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very timid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.   You're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) - but the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that in Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abiding the local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'm used to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I consider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...   Sorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a Peugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' over here - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.   I disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars weigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at 130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph, it makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on a bicycle: Your're dead.

God's love  is unconditional, unqualified, unfathomable.  We are capable of  rejecting God's love but He never fails to love us.  These verses do not show that God's love is qualified but rather that He  is opposed to evil.  I am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be  an innappropriate emphasis on Hell.  God deserves our love and worship  because of who He is.  I do not like the idea of frightening people into  accepting Christ.    I see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows God's love with  putting into words and explaining that love.  Preaching the Gospel  without living the Gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a  clanging cymbal.

The crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use unless they make you do some experiments.  I've known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit out loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.  (Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for Warren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created. Other species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me, Warren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)   I'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really working in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong, you will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_. If you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all in mind, you will probably get nowhere.   Unfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science: Lysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.   I don't agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at which I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing process.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.  Another point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental design''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_, not design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously been found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny nose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage was well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.   It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.\",\"  Several years ago GM was having trouble with the rings sticking on the 5.7 diesel.

While there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But since public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.  But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself.   There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter. One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve (Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).  Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius, op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.  Writings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is \\\"You seem to me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you\\\" (_Clementine Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.  Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.   But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist?  Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which I have taken a few:  1. \\\"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given\\\" (Matt. 13:11).  2. \\\"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\\\" (Matt. 19:11).  3. \\\"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\\\" (John 16:12).  4. \\\"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father\\\" (John 16:25).  5. \\\"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\\\" (1 Cor. 3:1-2).  6. \\\"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ... come unto you and speak face to face\\\" (2 Jn. 1:12).  (Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)  Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly.   Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons. There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific connection has yet been established.  My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------          Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City                     jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu\",\"    Hi:     Does anybody known how much about to buy an ethernet card for mac se ?

Can we perhaps as the question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal to the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written with something else in mind and \\\"propoganda\\\" put out by its supporters.         But let's be honest about something, here.  When was the last time you brought up all the valid points against your own arguments?         Or are they simply propogranda?  We can't know what Phill *really* means because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince.          If they're true or false, regardles of why they were said, why on earth did you make a point of calling them \\\"propogranda?\\\"  That would seem to be irrelevent.          Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don't believe they no longer apply, but that's because I think most of them were good arguments.  I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.          Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political system, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this particular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure and tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)           In principle no?  That they had less power of that they should have had less power?           Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  While the Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although badly) to the U.S. President.          Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives is \\\"in principle\\\" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate) but in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the Constitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh darn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put those extra restrictions on the Senate in?         Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell you, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of government to \\\"attack\\\" which presents them with the best chance of getting what they want.  With national \\\"interest groups\\\" it is simply a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a law rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less  \\\"contributions\\\" to make.          Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at the Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little state battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance, medicine, and most other questions.        Local government has not \\\"failed\\\" in that it hasn't done what it should, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their rules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout, only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because it can impose its will on the lower.        I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus- and such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed to a local crime?        The more people want the more Congress will take power to \\\"sell\\\" it to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of \\\"special interests\\\" is coincidence with the increased power of Congress.          Bingo.  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual need matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher levels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to in effectiveness.          Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York?  I remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable of educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And if you leave it to them, you only have to worry about the \\\"pork\\\" in that state.  And since industries can't concentrate their political power and wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get what they want, individual voices have more relative impact.         The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must \\\"buy off\\\" states, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.          But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself  that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact national legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem is significantly reduced.          The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable to action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering the government the usually the institution with the sole power to enforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those decisions a good thing.          The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have more legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution than the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is harder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing new deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out without a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the entire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different areas, different solutions may be called for.         And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local and state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to the city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather the majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in Washington with half a million or more constituents.         I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels are more corrupt.            Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators should be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was suppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this. Which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders wanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them, I never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution, which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for the House.          The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration of Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other examples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the reasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)          To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something it wasn't intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering the Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they want them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying about the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which almost necessitates its abuse.          *BUSH?*  Phill, that's absurd.  Bush had *37* vetos, one of which was over-ridden.  Go read up on FDR if you think that's anything resembling a record.          Why not?  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system against action?  Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have not been successful.  When you're in a position of imposing federal power on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to got through something more than a bare majority          Now we're switching from a general question of a fillibuster to a specific bill.

The problem is that there is no guarantee that this premium would be lower for those who chose this type of contract.  Although you are removing one service, that may have feedbacks into other types of covered care which results in a net increase in actuarial costs.  For an illustrative example in the opposite direction, it may be possible to ADD services to an insurance contract and REDUCE the premium.

I am not at all sure this is the best path to follow.  While the Bible is, for Christians, the word of God, the  revelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of this revalation is the Church. I am not recommending any one denommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian congregation in which to develop your faith, rather than just reading the Bible.  This does not mean that the Bible should not be read, although I would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid the Book of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you are comfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects to read the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable lack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the really sturdy, somewhere in Chronicles.  The point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith of Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vital beliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned - the Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church organization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the lived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one hopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studies in the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading.  Following up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I  would even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the christian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing the nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction into the christian faith was brought about [after grace] through reading Graham Greene: _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greene's _Monsignor Quixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian, but such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly, I often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after reading many parts of the Bible. And that after all is what being a Christian is all about: letting your soul and your life be, in some way, directed towards the infinite, represented to us by the person of Jesus Christ.\",\"}>On a }>waterski bike, you turn the handlebars left to lean right, just like on }>a motorcycle, so this supports the move-the-contact-patch-from-beneath-the }>centre-of-mass theory on how to *lean*.

BM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?     It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped    into Armenia if SHE could.

I will believe it when I see it.   Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing         to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean  BURNING people ALIVE !  BM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  BM] futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  BM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  BM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.     Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are          NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN.   BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent  BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe  BM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better  BM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?   Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the  conflict.

Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension         to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH         are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.  BM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  BM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians BM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate  BM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.

You lurkers can join in at any time, you know!  Ahhh.. Talk.politics.guns -- the kindler, gentler newsgroup.  Who would have thought?    I remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5' a reasonable space limitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to those nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at what distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the endangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility of being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and draw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user. Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault rifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has only range and acurracy going for it.    I disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this is not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change quite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians intent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.    That seems to be the case already, given that heavy weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low numbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks, whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.    I had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers of a select group, and the like would exercise control over the heavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman tank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders from the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large, though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should therefore be jointly maintained and operated.    This I'll agree with to a point.  The State having control over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state to have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that the ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise, I would have to assume that State control would rest on the authority of the Governor and militia officers.    I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons, fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few people with government support.  Just as you argued above that the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry. I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.    We have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble. I'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their armory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in. I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.    So would I, but the resources often aren't available to outfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to call in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster than anything else.    Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up field pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton trucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff of a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units in Iowa are currently fielding in some units.   Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy equipment under State control, with little but numbers and light stuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local ranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly, hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally, the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for other responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a very minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias for these functions.\",\"On March 21, 1993 Roger Maynard wrote (in reply to an article by Graham Hudson):    This was <1993Mar21.223936.6192@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca>, for anybody who would like to check.

When work for a large program like    Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the    center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts    to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the    center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to    be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about    that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10    billion won't be spent on anything having anything    to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion    was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done    with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting    the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the    existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the    term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are    getting and the price they are paying and note that    it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware    that a third of the money is going for something else.\\\"  My dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple of weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I talked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station at Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post a response immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposed to be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz data & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low on the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend in Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers  Association conference, extolling the virtues of SSF to 15,000 science teachers.]  First off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' does exist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax' for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million. This was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4 center 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at $2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is 04/2.2 = 1.8%  Over the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30 billion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to $540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I will concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket change.  I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could be close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds that are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some states, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat the food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get it take-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT* subject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds go to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax rate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at the center, and not to the prime contracts.  This leads to the obvious question \\\"What is the government doing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors? (i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A big portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens to the balance of the funds, which aren't eaten up by the center tax?)\\\"  At WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting development funds (as they are supporting the development work done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to setup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical power system architecture. Our testbed has a real life solar array field (left over from solar cell research research a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries (to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC switchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated loads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability of the power system.  We have also used the supporting development money to purchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life testing at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in Indiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on test recently hit the four year life test milestone. 38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the on-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).  As a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal computers and work stations, for performing system analyses (like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system, availability calculations using a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a  database with information on weight of the power system elements).  Finally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not all go into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the director does control a small discretionary fund. Each year, any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.  Most of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general' services at the Center, like the library, the  central computer services division, the Contractor  who removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the SSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To get an accurate figure, you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library (for example), and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support SSF (which would be hard to compute by itself - how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for 1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it on the person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week versus the rest of the center personnel). You would then have to compare this estimate of the SSF portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library. Who knows, maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but we underpay for snow removal?

I agree that Syria wants Lebanon to be part of its greater Syria. I don't necessarily see that the Syrians would be unhappy to see Israel up to its neck in another Lebanese morass afterwhich Syria could continue on its merry schedule when Israeli public opinion would lead to a second pullout.   <*sigh*>  Why can't some gov'ts negotiate as easily as some people? \",\"Experiment: From a Sun openwindows 4.1.3 xterm window log into a Solaris 2.x machine using rlogin; now do an \\\"ls\\\" and get the first character of each line display in the last column of the display with the rest of the line wrapped to the next line of the display.

And also better, because a neurologist can make a differential diagnosis between migraine, tension-type headache, cluster, benign intracranial hypertension, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, and other headache syndromes that all appear normal on a scan.

DN> And easier than taking the time to reassure the patient, right? DN> Personally, I don't think this can ever be justified.  Sigh.  It may never be justifiable, but I sometimes do it.  Even after I try to show thoroughness with a detailed history, neurologic examination, and discussion with the patient about my diagnosis, salted with lots of reassurance, patients still ask \\\"why can't you order a scan, so we can be absolutely sure?\\\"  Aunt Millie often gets into the conversation, as in \\\"they ignored Aunt Millie's headaches for years\\\", and then she died of a brain tumor, aneurysm, or whatever.  If you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a patient with an obviously benign headache syndrome, I'd like to hear what your magic is.  Every once in a while I am able to bypass imaging by getting an EEG. Mind you, I don't think EEG is terribly sensitive for brain tumor, but the patient feels like \\\"something is being done\\\" (as if the hours I spent talking with and examining the patient were \\\"nothing\\\"), the EEG has no ionizing radiation, it's *much* cheaper than CT or MRI, and the EEG brings in some money to my department.\",\"Here it is  Zoom 14.4k  FAX/DATA v.32bis modem.

Very little acne as a teenager. I didn't have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily it really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry.   Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day vitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it   is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease  on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating meat).  Keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it softens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with oilyness.   Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't be an infection afterwards.  Tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry makes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples).  \",\"The explanations of Federal law enforcement officials about what happened in Waco is just another example of the survivors writing the history books to put themselves in the best of a bad light. --  Dave Feustel N9MYI <feustel@netcom.com>\",\"Subject: Re: NETTEKI BUTUN VATANSEVERLERE DUYURU....  ca (Suat Kiniklioglu) [a.k.a.

The old tires that are on the bike are for the front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon Roadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger than that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend, and was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first motorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner tube qualities?  The above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current rear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought 100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be very good at getting close to matching mail order prices.  I am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the front and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer  lasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and FJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive behavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable back end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving much better tire milage life. Any comments?  A friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very good, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to mount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be careful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to check out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and I havn't had a chance to check the rim type.  On another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?) Vetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually I would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be fork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame mounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower bars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition runner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe' style. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is just that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)  -----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------                              edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475                              (208)323-2174   P.O.

I have delved a bit deeper (XKeyEvent) and found what I was looking for.  ev->state   has a bunch of masks to check against (LockMask is the one for CapsLock).  Unfortunately, it appears that the NumLock mask varies from server to server.  How does one tell what mask is numlock and which are for Meta (Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask). eg, SGI's vendor server has Mod2Mask being NumLock, whereas Solaris 1.0.1 OpenWindows 3.0 has Mod3Mask for NumLock.  Is there an unambiguous means of determining NumLock's mask at runtime for any given server?  Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance.\",\"   Ask the practitioner whether he uses the pre-sterilized disposable needles, or if he reuses needles, sterilizing them between use.  In the former case there's no conceivable way to get AIDS from the needles.  In the latter case it's highly unlikely (though many practitioners use the disposable variety anyway).  euclid\",\" I don't find this a credible argument, for two reasons.  One you have supplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the future (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to decap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating high-profit arcade machines and the like - who wouldn't care less), I am not  going to care much about US confidentiality, am I?  Only people like the real me, who does care about travelling to various countries for business reasons, will sit up and follow laws like this, but I would contend that we're not the main threat.  I also have grave doubts whether an algorythm widely distributed in silicon could possibly be called \\\"classified.\\\"  It's like handing out military secrets to the whole world in envelopes marked \\\"don't open me.\\\"  I can imagine several credible defences which could be employed if it came to a trial.  One would be the stupidity of the government's actions.   Amusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable for a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware? In DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you just swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect on the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of that cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that it would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search algorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware. I have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.   However, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its  designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion  of such techniques seems credible.  Hmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name \\\"Clipper\\\" for this device. :) \",\"I'd *desparately* prefer it if we didn't rehash the same arguments that went on ad infinitum last time.  That's especially true for sci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since the traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.  I'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my followup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your feelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an 80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less acceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one repository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper would need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out in this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search. A slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number, and then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys, neither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant to attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect the subkeys even more.  Other thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of the databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be their back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories' public keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session keys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This would answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you make sure they stop''.  We can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back door -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record of the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of the warrant.  I can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100 public key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need more keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be used to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant; the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very long.  I suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from the obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the back door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned about foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard rumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with DES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it was much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping the details secret so that others don't build their own implementations without the back door.\",\"I am a novice (at best) in working with pc networks, and am in the process of planning a small accounting system for a small business.  The particular need in this case is for three machines, each in a different office of the same building, each having access to a Windows-based accounting system.  My first thought is to set up MS Windows for Workgroups on each of the machines (likely a 486 and two 386's) along with the appropriate Ethernet cards and cabling that come with the Windows for Workgroups starter kit (one additional user kit will be necessary).  It then seems logical to purchase a simple multi-user accounting system, along the lines of DacEasy or M.Y.O.B., and fire it all up!  The 486 will more or less act as server with a report/check printer attached to it. Cable runs of 30-40 feet will be necessary for this setup.  Well, this all seems too easy to me.

You set up your answering machine on 4 rings and your fax on six rings.  You'd give out the new # as your fax #. A device would measure the length of rings.  When it detects a short ring, it turns off your answering machine. Five rings later your fax picks up the call.  This should be cheaper and more elegant than the $80 switches now available.

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers) =====================================================================  I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?  1. Free options  The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.  Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will  be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86  is listed below.   X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was  done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).  It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.  There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,  X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you  don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).  X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).  2. Commercial options       1) Metro Link  2213 W.

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?  3. What is XFree86?     XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with    X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and    other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:      1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,        selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require        an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of        1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by        default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield        up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.     2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default        operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now        equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately        20% faster than X386 1.2.     3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,        or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4        with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from        SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.     4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.        Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about        the ATI and Trident drivers.     5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's        code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).     6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is        compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the        contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.     7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font        renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary        distributions.     8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.     9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA        cards is now included.     The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2    (they were not in XFree86 1.1):      1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of        available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200         (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).     2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the        monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \\\"two        headed\\\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only        been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).     3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.     4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to        consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for        more information.)     5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some         versions of these devices were not previously compatible).     6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor        timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous        documentation and a lot of experimentation).     7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including        implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many         vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more         information).     8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has        been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of        0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks        line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.     9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig        configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative        and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new        options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1)         manual page for more information on the format of this file).         Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file        in the source distribution for full details.     Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the    current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.  4. What OSs are supported?      XFree86 supports:  SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2  SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC  SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2  Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1   BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active  BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.   Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,  but anyone should feel free to submit patches.  If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to  xfree86@physics.su.oz.au  5. What video hardware is supported?     At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:   Tseng ET4000  Tseng ET3000  Paradise PVGA1  Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of   the PVGA1, and use its driver)  Genoa GVGA  Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000  ATI 18800, 28800   All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,  with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in  256 color mode.   The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of  video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the  ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome  server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.   It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to  non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To  avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86  1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel  clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are  discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how  these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such  a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with  future XFree86 releases.   If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,  it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the  Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not  work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.  In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond  products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions  of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).  If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.   Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA  video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the  CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It  could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset  on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot  of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested  theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not  working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86  working fine on them.  6. What about accelerated boards?   At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards  like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available  in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).   An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact  <hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.   A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>  or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.  7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?   The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the  16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory  contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-  planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each  of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-  buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled  16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code  could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).  But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer  implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,  but nothing is yet available from the project.  8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?   Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run  X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.  The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending  on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).  To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will  be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable   lower bound.  9. Where can I get source for XFree86?   Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22  from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:   export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)   ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)   ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)  (For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)   Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information  on which files you need to get to build your distribution.  10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?   Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from:   ftp.physics.su.oz.au  - SVR4 binaries    under /XFree86/SVR4   ftp.win.tue.nl   - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/XFree86/SVR4   ferkel.ucsb.edu   - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/SVR4/XFree86   stasi.bradley.edu  - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/XFree86/SVR4   blancmange.ma.utexas.edu - SVR3 (ISC) binaries    under /pub/ISC   ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries    under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86   tsx-11.mit.edu   - Linux binaries    under /pub/linux/packages/X11   agate.berkeley.edu  - 386BSD binaries    under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86   ftp.cs.uwm.edu   - Mach binaries    under /i386   Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may  archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will  contain a README file that describes what files you need to take  from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were  made when building the distribution.  IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?  11. Installation directories   The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot  (/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include  files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.   This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified  via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is  nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed  alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.  12. Configuration files   The XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\\\"Xconfig\\\") on startup.  The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in  the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.  13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes   David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known  clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.  The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and  is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is  also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on  export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated  occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the  settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to  David for inclusion in the database.   If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file   with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.  It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use  this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information  to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.   NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and        is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot        clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from        your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The        server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.        You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your        Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up        starting the server in the future.  14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit   If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to  reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is  fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.  V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?   First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).  15. SVR4  Why won't my xterm run properly?   If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define  CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.  csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'   The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping  problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be  installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.  16. SVR3   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.  17. 386BSD   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.   Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey  <Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the  file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:       agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2      wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2      grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2  18. Linux   You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc  jump libraries installed.   Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.   If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to  run the server as \\\"X -pn\\\". The default startup configuration assumes  that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files  /usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the  -pn argument to X386.   Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major  number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not  owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit  console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but  startx won't.   When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with  a tty, for example \\\"xdm < /dev/console &\\\".   For more detailed information, please read the file README present  with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.  19. Mach   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.  VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?   This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is  fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.  Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.  VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?  20. BSD compatibility library   A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.  The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a  which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),  seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include  <X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro  definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are  linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these  functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a  21. ANSICCOPTIONS   This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the  ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite  the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see  something like   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of   ANSICCOPTIONS=\\\"-ansi\\\"   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:   ANSICCOPTIONS=  to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death  with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because  CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must  add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.  XFree86 Contact Information      Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86     Core Team.  At this time the Core Team consists of:   The original \\\"gang of four\\\":   David Dawes <dawes@physics.su.oz.au>   Glenn Lai <glenn@cs.utexas.edu>   Jim Tsillas <jtsilla@damon.ccs.northeastern.edu>   David Wexelblat <dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com>   Those supporting non-SYSV operating systems:   Robert Baron <Robert.Baron@ernst.mach.cs.cmu.edu> [Mach]   Rich Murphey <Rich@Rice.edu> [386BSD]   Orest Zborowski <obz@kodak.com> [Linux]      e-mail sent to <xfree86@physics.su.oz.au> will reach all of the core team.   --------------------------------------------------  Thanks to all the people who already sent me corrections or additions, especially David Wexelblat (one of the major contributors of updates).\",\"Does anybody have an X server for NT that they're willing to share files or experiences?\",\"While driving through the middle of nowhere, I picked up KNBR, AM 1070, a clear-channel station based in Los Angeles.

Just as international law recognizes the right of the occupying  entity to maintain order, especially in the face of elements that are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil structure.  Ironically, international law recognizes each of these focusses (that of the occupied and the occupier) even though they are  inherently in conflict.  Israel certainly cannot, and should not, continue its present policies towards Gazan residents. There is, however, a third  alternative- the creation and implementation of a jewish \\\"dhimmi\\\" system with Gazans/Palestinians as benignly \\\"protected\\\" citizens. Would you find THAT as acceptable in that form as you do with regard to Islam's policies towards its minorities?    It is a race, then?

I got it from a The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the editor.       Saint Aloysius Gonzaga      The Patron of Youth       The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince     Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured     soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of     Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and     honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in     the manner expected.      Saint Aloysius' mother was a woman who received immense joy  from     praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the     life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this     life.  As  Saint  Aloysius grew, he began to resemble his mother     more than his father.      Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father's     soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he     fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an     example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).      About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received     from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself     became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and     asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.      He wanted to share Our Lord's suffering to show  his  reciprocal     love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the     finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of     wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.     While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his     younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.     Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well     with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,     intelligent and always had something interesting to say.       Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint Igna-     tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)     towards which Saint Aloysius         -12-            began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the     marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.      After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in     order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even      through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the     religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.      The Marquis' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his     son:  \\\"Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-     ness?\\\" \\\"I will not, father,\\\" was the  in-evitable  reply. \\\"Then     leave from my sight and don't return until you change your mind!\\\"     With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to pray:     \\\"Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!\\\" He knelt down     to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but     this  time he was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This     at last brought the proud man to his senses. \\\"The Lord wants him,     the Lord can have him.\\\" He gave his consent for his son to become     a Jesuit.      After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-     ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and     could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy-     sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare     the dying for a holy death.      Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from carrying  and     nursing  the  sick.  For three months he lay with a burning fever     and finally, on June 21st, 1591, he gave his  soul to  the  Lord     while gazing at a crucifix.      Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his     humility, purity and confidence in prayer.      Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, pray for us.      - Brendan Arthur           Prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service  of     others as a sword is to a soldier  God Bless  From Simon Lines:  106\",\"try comp.dcom -  I was reading a thread a while back about an 800 number that you could dial.  worked here.

On a scale from cold to hot, you are at 0 degrees Kelvin.   Then as you understand it, what is it?   Yes.  I agree with that.  But what does that have to do with Jesus? Punishment you say?  Jesus did not regard his death as punishment.    Good.  I wouldn't either--not the way you understand it.     Ask Jesus himself.  He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for a persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your question.  Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason why Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with his punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that we would \\\"stop doubting and believe\\\" (John 21:27).  The fact that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise from the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it. Without this obvious point, I would have no hope and my faith would be vanity.  Why did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus says why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  \\\"The world hates him without reason.\\\"  It is a direct proclamation of how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we need a Saviour.\",\"Most of you will have probably seen the news by the time you read this, but the Branch Davidian compound is no more.  This morning about 6:00, the feds punched holes in the compound walls by using a tank.  They  then started using non-lethal tear gas.  Shortly after noon, 2 cult members were seen setting fire to the compound.  So far, about 20-30 people have been seen outside the compound.  The fate of the other 60 or 70 people is unknown, neither is the fate of the 17 children that were inside.  The compound did burn to the ground.  Koresh, who at times has claimed to be the Messiah, but then backed off and only claimed to be a prophet, had promised several times to come out peacefully if his demands were met.  First, he demanded that his message be broadcast on the radio, which it was, but he didn't come out. He claimed to be waiting for a message from God.  Finally, he said that God told him that he needed to decipher the mystery of the 7 seals in Revelation, and when he was finished, he'd come out.  He finished the first one, but didn't do any more work that anyone knows of since then. The federal agents did warn him that if they didn't come out, they  would be subjected to tear gas.  I think it's really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere man, even if he did claim to be the son of God, and/or a prophet.  I think it underscores the importance of putting you faith only in things that are eternal and knowing for yourself what the Scriptures say and what they mean, instead of relying on others to do it for you, even if those others are learned and mean well.\",\"I want to go from 512K to 1M VRAM on my Quadra 800.

EDT                     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you  in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking  part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.              You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas  Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to  mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he  has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all  followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education  here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according  to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational  system.              His philosophy of government, his belief in the  importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest  here this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us  President Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in  the Chamber of Commerce studios.                Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for  taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite  network and we welcome you here this evening.              Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.   And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening  also.              I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure  many of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that  you'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In  Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.              I believe the President has a few words that he might  want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that  at this time.  It's great to have you.              THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.              I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob  Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the  Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making,  along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine  tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people  from school to the work place.              I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts,  recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this  economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to  work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to  make things happen.              This satellite town meeting is a good example of that  kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home  state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart  Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing  several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I  appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all  the rest of you.              I have tried as hard as I could to move toward  constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about  this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson  believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in  education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion,  freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and  third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.                If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this  beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful  cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change  with changing times.              For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit  and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we  can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight -- about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless  we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in  government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase  our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the  long run.              We also have to have people who can carry their load.   And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven  or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system  and continues into the work force where education must go on for a  lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can  learn.              And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing  we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership  between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the  private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're  trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that  would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many  thousands that have a strong education component so our young people  can be learning and working at the same time.              Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good  place we can begin, I think, the discussion.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.              Each month we get together and talk about ways that all  citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And  tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours  can prepare students for this world of work.              This week, the Education Department and the Labor  Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called  Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.   The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's  proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched  jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged  areas of the country.                Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it  somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls  for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your  words is that so important?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.   First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may  have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want  them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to  continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of  research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may  forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year  over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for  schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already  taught before.              Secondly, we want to help these young people progress,  not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to  abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is  learning because we think that the best and most productive workers  will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience  could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to  succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are  disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go  into the next year, is really even greater.                Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs  throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this  educational component of training.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr.  Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer  or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with  education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people,  for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning  geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or  working on something, and they can see the exact and direct  application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a  lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between  education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.   It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of  young people even beyond the summer.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.                Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship  program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell  us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it  developing.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why  it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade  will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will  require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people  get in a high school diploma.                If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries  of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school  education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young  people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not  go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because  they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their  employers.              So we think America has a big economic interest in  trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school  but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes  two years of further training either in a community college, a  vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in  this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some  funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states  and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in  a way that would be customized essentially by the business community,  based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could  revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and  the earnings of American workers.              SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think  you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the  people watching this program -- that the business community and  educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many  of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In  fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The  people watching this program probably are the ones who are most  directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley  and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes  already out there.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight  about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning   career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal  with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of  these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and  you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much  longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business  community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're  doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The  Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these  kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've  aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.              The business community is going to be actively engaged  in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and  helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions  develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.              Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is  one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these  players in a community come together and work together and cooperate  together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and  the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody  is talking, but they're not really working together in a common  strategy.              And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick,  would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic  excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a  tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to  make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be  eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year  college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're  talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation  skills for on-the-job learning.              And again, those are the critical components.  It's  already being done.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one  point based on my personal experience at home -- the business  community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are  the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught,  but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort  of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are  going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the  second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and  influence them.  So I think that's very important.              And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at  the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some  funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make  sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the  quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to  determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.              SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of  course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery  program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about  long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr.  President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the  communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be  coming forth before too long.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I  were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public  schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that  a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.                I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals  that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President  Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to  do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in  Congress that will actually define the things that the national  government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the  children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those  goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school  ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school  graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are  confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are  second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe,  disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took  them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of  life-long learning in this country.              And each one of those goals there's a national role, a  state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector  role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to  introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is;  and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job  is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality  that we need to meet.              It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite  like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.   Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their  money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and  partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really  it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms  of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to  support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform  efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.              Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to  the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of  course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and  I wonder if you would comment on that.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of  our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they  don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system  of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had  national skill standards to which they could aspire and which  employers would understand as a national credential, many of these  young people would actually find that they were much more eligible  for jobs.              Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other  countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to  college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain  technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If  you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to  develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working  with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private  industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the  kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other  institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go  ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce  Todd of Austin, Texas.              Q   Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and  Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We  have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who  have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me  simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with  much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are  very supportive.                We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our  summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to  have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much  as 3,500 with the federal assistance.                Much of the question that we had designed you have  answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But  the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day  would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round  is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal  level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year- round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the  local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's  something that we believe is very important to success in this  effort.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to  answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling,  and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.   I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.                First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can  structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer  program and that will move a lot of these young people back into  schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in  the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to  try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs  to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're  working on that.              Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the  Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to  build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job  training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give  heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you  asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we  hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being  trained on a year-round basis.              And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said  a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen  as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people  actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when  they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we  hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and  we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget  cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue  raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be  able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.              Bob, do you want to say anything?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out  of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing,  and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high  school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in  addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of  jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.   It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the  economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything  else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I  think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I  think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or  greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going  to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything  right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000  will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into  next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it  will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working  together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And  then the state, with all the various school districts, a very  important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I  think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that  moving.              The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.                Doctor?              Q   Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to  be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school  and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since  its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two  alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages  we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an  extremely effective learning strategy.              And over the years, we've come to believe that there are  several principles that are very important in bridging the school and  work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with  practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure  to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect  upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and  lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the  development of high performance competencies.                My question, then is:  How can the general education  faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with  transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies  can you suggest to achieve this integration?              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think --  and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting  work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next  guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists    in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to  them and we can discuss it later.              You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?              THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one  thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as  clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the  people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more  explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics  is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish  what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is  vocational learning and what is academic learning.              I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think  we should have a strong component for people who are in the  vocational program.              SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to  rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and  work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're  important for all students.  It's not just a special group of  students that needs them.              Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United  States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream  experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and  12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience  and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on  to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they  can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and  career directions.              But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often  goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work- related work within the classroom, within our schools.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's  going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I  think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank  you and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and  your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \",\"Archive-name: Xt-FAQ Version: $Id: FAQ-Xt,v 1.28 93/04/02 12:41:12 ware Exp $        The X Toolkit Intrinsics F.A.Q      A monthly posting   This article contains the answers to some Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) from comp.windows.x about the X Toolkit Intrinsics.

Xt Glossary ----------------------------------------------------------------------  o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code   to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with   this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,   RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,   etc.  The terms \\\"Xt\\\" and \\\"Intrinsics\\\" are used interchangeably,   however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X   window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,   Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the   Intrinsics are not especially useful.  o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The   precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It   is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the   Object class although these are more accurately called windowless   widgets or gadgets.  o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below   the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib   functions because Xt provides most such services although an   understanding of Xlib helps with problems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  In brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for critical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the appropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a list traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.  The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the interrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous to add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never be called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop about the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal. However, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.  Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.          Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4.  How do I use a different visual than the default? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has three things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and border pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap resource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions deals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen and DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is not properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is created.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends on the visual being used.    How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier because the basic information you need is available.  The first is a little harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the needed information.  /*  * Some sample code to start up an application using something other  * than the default visual.  *  * To compile:  * cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm  *  * To run:  * ./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow  *  * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap  * to install.  */  #include <X11/Intrinsic.h> #include <X11/StringDefs.h> #include <X11/Shell.h>  typedef struct {  Visual *visual;  int depth; } OptionsRec;  OptionsRec Options;  XtResource resources[] = {  {\\\"visual\\\", \\\"Visual\\\", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *),  XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL},  {\\\"depth\\\", \\\"Depth\\\", XtRInt, sizeof (int),  XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL}, };  XrmOptionDescRec Desc[] = {  {\\\"-visual\\\", \\\"*visual\\\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL},  {\\\"-depth\\\", \\\"*depth\\\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL} };    int main (argc, argv)  int  argc;  char  **argv; {  XtAppContext app;  /* the application context */  Widget  top;  /* toplevel widget */  Display  *dpy;  /* display */  char  **xargv; /* saved argument vector */  int  xargc;  /* saved argument count */  Colormap colormap; /* created colormap */  XVisualInfo vinfo;  /* template for find visual */  XVisualInfo *vinfo_list; /* returned list of visuals */  int  count;  /* number of matchs (only 1?) */  Arg  args[10];  Cardinal cnt;  char  *name = \\\"test\\\";  char  *class = \\\"Test\\\";   /*   * save the command line arguments   */   xargc = argc;  xargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *));  bcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));   /*   * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can   * retrieve the appropriate visual resource.   */  cnt = 0;  top = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv,           (String *) NULL, args, cnt);  dpy = XtDisplay (top);  cnt = 0;  XtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources,        XtNumber (resources),        args, cnt);  cnt = 0;  if (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top)))  {   XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt;   /*    * Now we create an appropriate colormap.

Which visual should an application use? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to be specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your application probably falls into the category of always using the default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular visual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some such).  Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server allocates resources I may not always want your application to run in TrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may be very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor or just monochrome.  As an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different possible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static color, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above  plus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that shell.  A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have its own realize method to use the visual when it calls XCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be obtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A reasonable value is probably XtNvisual.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This is interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen() and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e. it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.  If the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies colormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the visual.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This was especially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  See section 2.8 of the Xt specification.  It eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The Intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed. It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any pending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned up before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then performed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have completed, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the list is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among other things.  As some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the Intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the widgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs immediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not destroyed until returning to the outer event loop.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting an application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget may not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open sockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):    Widget  ToplevelGet (gw)   Widget  gw;  /* widget to find toplevel */  {   Widget  top;    for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))    /* empty */;   return (top);  }   void  ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)   Widget  gw;  /* widget */   XtPointer closure; /* data the app specified */   XtPointer call_data; /* widget specific data */  {   Widget  toplevel;    toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);   XtUnmapWidget (toplevel); /* make it disappear quickly */   XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);   exit (0);  }  One can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying the toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never occur.    This works for most widgets and most applications but will not work for those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant of the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the widget may change and someday require that some external state is cleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.  One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and difficult to maintain practices.  Try the following code instead.   #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>   extern Widget ToplevelGet (  #if NeedFunctionPrototypes   Widget  gw  #endif  );   extern Boolean ExitWorkProc (  #if NeedFunctionPrototypes   XtPointer closure  #endif  );   extern void ExitCallback (  #if NeedFunctionPrototypes   Widget  gw,   XtPointer closure,   XtPointer call_data  #endif  );   Widget  ToplevelGet (gw)  Widget  gw;  /* widget to find toplevel */  {   Widget  top;    for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))    /* empty */;   return (top);  }    void  ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)  Widget  gw;  /* widget */  XtPointer closure; /* data the app specified */  XtPointer call_data; /* widget specific data */  {   Widget  toplevel;    toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);   XtUnmapWidget (toplevel); /* make it disappear quickly */   XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);   XtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),       ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);  }   Boolean  ExitWorkProc (closure)   XtPointer closure;  {   exit (0);   /*NOTREACHED*/  }   ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the application is next idle -- which happens after all the events are processed and the destroy callbacks are executed.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. How do I resize a Shell widget? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  After it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper thing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget using XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the Shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the request.  However, the Shell must have the resource XtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the window manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.  To change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not the child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  It does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does not fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not block, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to block.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For a file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF -- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to be read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based OS's it is the poll() system call.  How to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use another process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe to connect the application with this other process and pass the file descriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on BSD systems is \\\"tail -f filename\\\".  It's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_ reliable.  In particular:   - IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while    (several thousand times) and then stop until some other    event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race    condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.   - Pyramid, doesn't work at all.   - Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as    sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing    side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it    all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at    a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks    (get raound it by detecting the situation and having    select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had    been given the whole block).   Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as read(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and may not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with part of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this point I don't know.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  I have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full details of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already familiar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may not find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, which means its a 1000 pages.  Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., \\\"X Window System Toolkit, The  Complete Programmer's Guide and Specification\\\", Digital Press,  1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by  Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC  Direct at 1-800-DIGITAL.  The other book I commonly recomend to novices is:  Young, Doug. \\\"The X Window System: Applications and Programming with  Xt (Motif Version),\\\" Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8).  (ISBN 0-13-972167-3)  And of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt. O'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt reference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively overhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding it very useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related information.  I read two periodicals, \\\"The X Resource\\\" and the \\\"The X Journal\\\". These are the only two dealing specifically with X.  \\\"The X Resource\\\" is published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being the MIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no advertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  For orders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorial matters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted at math.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in ~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.   \\\"The X Journal\\\" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising. The articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical audience.  I read it more to see what's going on then with an expectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a fairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty good collection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call (908) 563-9033.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 14. What Widgets are available? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  There are three popular widget sets:  Athena - The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most    purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is    available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z. Motif - From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on    many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but    Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think    it is poorly implemented. OLIT - The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets    implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by    AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.    I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.  In addition the following collection of widgets are also available:  Xtra - a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software    Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked    bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,    spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen    them so I can't comment. FWF - The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of    freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,    FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets    can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine    a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z. Xcu - The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the    early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for    buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so    widely used. Xs - The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but    seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise. Xw - The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written    for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.    Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.    The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was    originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided    much experience for the designers of Xt. Xo - A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you    can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*  The following specialized widgets are also available:  Tbl - Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif    widgets as children.  Part of Wcl. Plots - The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).    Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there? ----------------------------------------------------------------------   __________________________________________  Name  Language Vendor  __________________________________________  Xview  C  Sun  OI  C++  ParcPlace  Interviews C++  Stanford  Tcl/tk  C  sprite.berkeley.edu  __________________________________________   However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and implementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop in the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language other than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  First, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)  typdef struct  {       String name;      long value;  } Arg;  and the code:  Arg arg;   XtSetArg (arg, \\\"name\\\", 3.2)  expands to  Arg arg;   arg.name = \\\"name\\\";  arg.value = 3.2;  you can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value gets the integer \\\"3\\\" instead of the floating point value \\\"3.2\\\".  When the value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is wildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So, how to get around this?  The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now recomending it over the previous suggestions.  #define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\\\     if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\\\         XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\\\     } else { \\\\         XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\\\         XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\\\     }   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. How do I write a resource converter? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Courtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):  The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5) Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow for destructors and caching of converted values.  There are several main types of resource converters:      string to data type     data type to string     data type to data type  i) string to data type     Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings     that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often     used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:   Name  Value  \\\"True\\\"  1  \\\"False\\\"  0      In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare     the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most     readily accomplished by the use of the \\\"quark\\\" mechanism of the     resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,     which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a     single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the     quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.      If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many     converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then     a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the     resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of     these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks     and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one     of the converters.  ii) data type to string     This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data     type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,     the data type value is simply converted to a string value,     probably by the use of sprintf.      Data type to string converters are useful for applications that     wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that     they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This     mechanism can be used to provide a \\\"snapshot\\\" of application state     into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to     a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.      If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type     converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to     string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure     that they are consistent.  iii) data type to data type     This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type     value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be     converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for     red, green and blue.   The type signature for a resource converter is as follows:  typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,  XrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);     Display *dpy;     XrmValuePtr args;     Cardinal *num_args;     XrmValuePtr fromVal;     XrmValuePtr toVal;     XtPointer *converter_data;  When the converter is invoked, the \\\"fromVal\\\" argument points to the source X resource manager value and the \\\"toVal\\\" argument points to the destination X resource manager value.  The \\\"converter_data\\\" argument is an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified when the converter is registered.  The \\\"args\\\" and \\\"num_args\\\" arguments allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is invoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the Pixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.  Care must be taken with the \\\"toVal\\\" argument.  An XrmValue has the following type definition and specifies a size and location for a converted value:  typedef struct {     unsigned int    size;     caddr_t         addr; } XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;  When the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of the given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL. In the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the destination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If the destination area is not large enough, then the converter should set the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the converter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply copy the converted value into the space given and return True.  If the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to the address of a static variable containing the converted value and return True.  When writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it becomes convenient to define a macro:      #define DONE(var, type) \\\\       if (toVal->addr) \\\\  { \\\\    if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\\      { \\\\        toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\        return False; \\\\      } \\\\    else \\\\      *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\\  } \\\\       else \\\\  toVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\\\       toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\       return True;      #define DONESTR(str) \\\\       if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\\  { \\\\    toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\    return False; \\\\  } \\\\       else \\\\  toVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\\\       toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\       return True;  Inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety checking on the \\\"num_args\\\" and \\\"args\\\" arguments to ensure that your converter is being called properly.  Once you have written your converter, you need to register it with the Intrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.  To register a converter with a single application context, use XtAppSetTypeConverter:  void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,  cache, destructor)     XtAppContext context;     String from;     String to;     XtTypeConverter converter;     XtConvertArgList args;     Cardinal num_args;     XtCacheType cache;     XtDestructor destructor;  To register a converter with all application contexts, use XtSetTypeConverter:  void XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,  cache, destructor)     String from;     String to;     XtTypeConverter converter;     XtConvertArgList args;     Cardinal num_args;     XtCacheType cache;     XtDestructor destructor;  In the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and XtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter and XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be used.  When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a \\\"cache\\\" argument specifies how converted resource values are to be cached:      XtCacheNone  Don't cache any converted values     XtCacheAll  Cache all converted values     XtCacheByDisplay Cache converted values on a per display basis  Caching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a good idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).  The \\\"destructor\\\" argument is a routine that is invoked then the resource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is being destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:  typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,  XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);     XtAppContext context;     XrmValuePtr to;     XtPointer converter_data;     XrmValuePtr args;     Cardinal *num_args;  The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated with the \\\"to\\\" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed to by the \\\"to\\\" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the conversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments for the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to free the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private data passed in when the converter was registered.  Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT R5 distribution:      mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c     contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c     contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. How do I open multiple displays? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  See \\\"Multi-user Application Software Using Xt\\\", The X Resource, Issue 3, (Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues involved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a nutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_ application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display and remove it from the application context.  The real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can happen 3 ways:  1. User selects a \\\"quit\\\" button on one of the displays,  2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,  3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,     server shutdown/crash, or network failure.  I'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a problem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that display.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.  The third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the Oliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult problem.  The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O error is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true for a single display X based application, but not true for a multiple display program or an application that does things other than display information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the I/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit() happens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid returning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment demonstrates this:  #include <setjmp.h> jmp_buf XIOrecover;  void XIOHandler (dpy)  Display  *dpy; {  destroyDisplay (dpy);  longjmp (XIOrecover, 1); }  main () {  ...  if (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)   XSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);  XtAppMainLoop (app_context); }  The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go back to the application specific data and perform any necessary cleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().  For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is first called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the jmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to the same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value of this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to longjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this purpose it is adequate.  Some other problems you might run into are resource converters that improperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors such as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical value.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to connect to a display.  There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in November of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically said this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 19. What changed from R3 to R4 to R5? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This addresses only changes in the Intrinsics.  First, the general changes for each release are described.  Then a, certainly incomplete, list of new functions added and others that are now deprecated are listed.  Brevity is a primary goal.  Much of the following information is retrieved from Chapter 13 of the MIT Xt Intrinsics Manual and from O'Reilly Volume 5, 3rd edition.  From R3 to R4 - Addition of gadgets (windowless widgets) - New resource type converter interface to handle cacheing and   additional  data. - Variable argument list interface. - #define XtSpecificationRelease 4  (added with this release) - WMShellPart, TopLevelShellPart & TransientShellPart changed   incompatibly. - core.initialize, core.set_values added ArgList and count parameters - event handlers had continue_to_dispatch parameter added - core.set_values_almost specification changed. - core.compress_exposure changed to an enumerated data type from Boolean - core.class_inited changed to enumerated data type from Boolean - constraint.get_values_hook added to extension record - core.initialize_hook obsolete as info is passed to core.initialize - shell.root_geometry_manager added to extension record - core.set_values_hook obsolete as info is passed to core.set_values - Calling XtQueryGeometry() must store complete geometry. - Added UnrealizeCallback. - XtTranslateCoords() actually works under R4.

Where are the resources loaded from? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places (from highest priority to lowest priority):   1. Args passed at creation time.  2. Command line arguments.  3. User's per host defaults file  4. User's defaults file.  5. User's per application default file.  6. System wide per application default file.  Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result of steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.  The per host defaults file contains customizations for all applications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either specified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.  The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program \\\"xrdb\\\" is used to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the display must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is reasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER but most do not.  A user may have many per application default files containing customizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.  The system wide per application default files are typically found in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the fallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.  [Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]  You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.  Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located):   setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N  The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see XtResolvePathname()):   %N The value of the filename parameter, or the   application's class name.  %T The value of the file \\\"type\\\".  In this case, the   literal string \\\"app-defaults\\\"  %C customization resource (R5 only)  %S Suffix.  None for app-defaults.  %L Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \\\"ja_JP.EUC\\\")  %l Language part of %L  (e.g. \\\"ja\\\")  %t The territory part of the display's language string  %c The codeset part of the display's language string  Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is \\\"Myterm\\\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm  $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm  As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.  Let's consider another example. This time, let's set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.   setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N  The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,       for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is       defined so %T and %S are useless.  With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization resource value.  For example, you might run the \\\"myterm\\\" application like this:   myterm -xrm \\\"*customization: -color\\\"  If one of your pathname specifications had the value \\\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C\\\" then the expanded pathname would be \\\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\\\" because the %C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource.  The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:    /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N  (Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings.)  The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is     <root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   <root>/%L/%N:\\\\   <root>/%l/%N:\\\\   <root>/%N:  <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.  Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to \\\".\\\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \\\"./\\\", a dot followed by a slash.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. What order are callbacks executed in? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)  The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to modify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one currently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot guarantee the order of execution.  The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have; therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the list.  Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback    \\\"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the   procedure is to be appended.\\\"   you may not infer from the word \\\"appended\\\" that the callback routines are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback list.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 22. How do I know if a widget is visible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)   Right, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a \\\"deficiency\\\" in the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the protocol.  (The \\\"deficiency\\\" is that the information is available in one way, in this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section carefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.  A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from viewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped; that is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency. Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol; see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.   You'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.   As an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action routine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget which contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the map_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are suggestions.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  You can't.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc() tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is handled something like:   ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))  if (!ptr)  {   perror (\\\"malloc in xyzzy()\\\");   exit (1)  } To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions XtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which all use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and realloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.  In addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses XtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:   if (!ptr)   ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));  else   ptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));  ++count;  to be written as:   ptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);  Also, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I've found the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'm allocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so I can fully recover from not enough memory errors.  XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a structure or copying a string:     struct abc *xyzzy;    char      *ptr;    char      *str = \\\"abcdef\\\";     xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc); /* takes care of type casting */    ptr = XtNewString (str);  A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with malloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:    char       *ptr;    ptr = XtMalloc (100);   /* ... */   free (ptr);  may not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did this broken and complain to the vendor.  A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string when they should really be using XmStringFree().  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. How to debug an Xt application? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First, I'd recomend getting \\\"purify\\\" from Pure Software.  This is a great package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey at $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb (contact support@pure.com for more info).   Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into  the object code produced by existing compilers.  These  instructions check every memory read and write performed by  the program under test and detect several types of access  errors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past  malloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts  checking logic into all of the code in a program, including  third party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies  system call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory  usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel  adaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly  comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program  down typically by a factor of two to five.  An alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on many Unix's and has pretty similar features is \\\"The SENTINEL Debugging Environment\\\".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library functions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com for more info)  Next, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run in synchronous mode, easily accomplished with the \\\"-sync\\\" command line argument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then set a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the original Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous mode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to Xlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the server are asynchronous.  Next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the undocumented resource \\\"xtIdentifyWindows\\\" or the class resource \\\"XtDebug\\\" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window. For example:      example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &     example% xwininfo -tree       <click in new xload window>  will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each window is included.  This can help for checking the location and size of errant widgets.  Next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to test the way a widget manages it's children, you can try export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour of both.  It's a very clever idea.  The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from a pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to go to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands. Unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to your application which is stopped.  The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on your desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment) on one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly using a command sequence like this:   othermachine% xhost +thismachine  thismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;  thismachine% gdb application # Your favorite debugger.  or this:  othermachine% xhost +thismachine  thismachine% gdb application  (gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0  (gdb) run ...  I believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method of dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to release any grabs during breakpoints.  Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and knowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing the internals of a particular widget but not very far without understanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great deal.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work? ----------------------------------------------------------------------    I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,    XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when    I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.    I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works    perfect, but in my \\\"real\\\" application nothing happens.   The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those routines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is they use a default application context different then the one you may have created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per application context basis and you are using two application contexts, you won't get those events.  For example:   ...  cnt = 0;  toplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,        Desc, XtNumber (Desc),        &argc, argv,        Fallback, args, cnt);   XtAddTimeOut (...)  XtAddWorkProc (...)   XtAppMainLoop (app)  would never invoke the timeout.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)  Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an ``intuitive'' fashion.  Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has supported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with each other, and so far as I know, they are not published.  I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public protocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to support a \\\"standard\\\" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop and contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long as it is based on Xt).  The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM conventions, for more details read the code.  I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that it works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif anyway.  The latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from netcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.  A (possibly older) version is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib.\",\"Well, the title says it all...I'm looking to buy cheap used TG-16 Gmaes which have 2 or more player support (Simultaneous)....

I must say that the connections between the power supply and the Monitor and Main Board are usable to this failure, Ram simms can be badly connected due to some corrosion and the powersupply can be in the last phase (lower Voltage).

More than enough to carry away excessive heat.  My opinions once again. \",\"I used to be a marriage commissioner for the Alaska Court System (sort of a justice of the peace).  I had great difficulty with that duty.  I used to pray earnestly in the courthouse bathroom before the ceremonies, mostly asking that the couples would come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and divine purpose in marriage--couples who obviously didn't realize that marriage is God's institution, not the state's.  Gradually, however, I came to conclude that because I was acting in a strictly secular, public capacity, established as such by both the state and the expectations of the couples involved, I was really conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with no greater moral or religious implications than if I had been conducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony, to \\\"please hurry it up\\\" may have helped me to this conclusion).        I thought I had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp distinction between marriage before God, and \\\"marriage\\\" before the state, until I had to deal with my own divorce.  Keeping Matthew 19:6 in mind, I felt that the state had no business dissolving my marriage established before God, but of course it assumed jurisdiction nonetheless.          I would ask those of you proposing answers to this question to consider this issue's logical extension: If intercourse, or the mental intent of the parties, or the ceremony of the church, or any combination thereof, establishes marriage, then at what moment is it dissolved?  \",\"Sorry to everyone for wasting space.  Matt, the other day you posted that you were doing a mailing list of playoff stats.  I lost your address.  Please put me on that list.  Thanks.\",\" My choice for the escow house would be the Smithsonian, and someplace on the west coast.  My biggest concern isn't that the escrow house could be compromised (it will be), but the fact it has been compromised will be kept secret.    The keys could be kept under glass, with 24-hour C-SPAN coverage.  If you thought your key had been stolen just turn on the cable, and wait until the roving camera reachs the musuem case with your key.  Or if you think the C-SPAN satellite has been compromised, take a tour of the Smithsonian yourself, and view the seal on your key. \",\"I believe it goes or will go: 680060 powerPC Pentium 680040 486 680030 386 680020 286=680000  In a resent article in one of the macMags I think a 50mHz 030 accelerator was  slightly slower than a 25mHz 040 accel. But, this is using a system designed  for the 030. So, It stands to reason that a system designed for an 040 ie  quadra) would do better. So overall I'd figure 040 = 030 * 2.5 or so.     Along the same lines the new POwerPC stuff is supposed to run the system  at the level of a fast quadra, but system 8 or whatever will allow 3 times the  speed of a 040 in the powerPC based systems. and wait for the 680060. I think  it laps the pentium.  pro-life pro-women  \",\"       I am not Mathew (Mantis) but any (successful) first year logic student will see that you are logically correct, the other poster is logically incorrect. \",\" I am told that Planned Parenthood/SIECUS-style \\\"values-free\\\" methods, that teach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make \\\"choices\\\", actually _increase_ pregnancy rates. I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.  The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate.  The difference is not in \\\"contraceptive technology\\\" but in the values taught to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids.  Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired.    Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't we teach \\\"safe drug use\\\" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it because we know that a class in \\\"how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs\\\" would increase drug use?  Why isn't \\\"drug abstinence education\\\" barred from schools because it teaches \\\"religion\\\"?  Aren't we abandoning those children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe use?  \",\"Try the firearms archive.  Larry Cipriani's instructions follow.

This directory can be used for things like articles by Kates, Wright, Tonso, Levinson, Supreme Court Decisions, the RIA vs US decision, copies of legislation, and so on.  It's not meant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.  So, in the future if you're looking for something check there first and then ask here.  Instructions:  Short version for techies:  The site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into the directory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commands get, put, mget, or mput should work.  Give the command \\\"type binary\\\" to be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be moved to the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget.  I will maintain an index which you should get first to check if the file you want to read or write already is archived.  Long version for non-techies:  In order for you to use this archive your computer must be on the Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command:   ftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu  If that doesn't work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftp command is successful you'll get this prompt asking you for a login:  Name (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):  Instead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with:   ftp  Next you'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:   Guest login ok, send e-mail address as password:  I would enter:   l.v.cipriani@att.com  You'll enter your own e-mail address.  You'll get these lines or similar as output:   Remote system is UNIX.  Using binary mode to transfer files.  Next, the command prompt is printed:   ftp>   If you do not get the line \\\"Using binary mode to transfer files.\\\" Run the command:   type binary  Now you're logged in to the archive machine.  There are many directories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are   /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba and  /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming  There are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.  When you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreive files change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:   cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba or  cd pub/firearms/politics/rkba  To submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with the command:   cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming or  cd pub/firearms/politics/incoming  Once you do this you'll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter another command.  To find the names of the existing files in the directory you are in run the command:   ls -l  This will produce something like:  total 6021 -r--r--r--  1 karl          6932 Jun 16  1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP -r--r--r--  1 karl         69149 Apr  5 19:20 INDEX -r--r--r--  1 karl         18965 Jun 16  1992 Knox_AW_lies -r--r--r--  1 karl         10930 Apr 30  1992 S361 -r--r--r--  1 karl          8958 Jun 16  1992 WSJ_Crimestrike -r--r--r--  1 karl          2649 Jan 13 18:33 academia-bias -r--r--r--  1 karl           935 Mar 22 22:38 academics -r--r--r--  1 karl         36079 Aug  4  1992 aclu ... and so on ...  Each line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left, the fields are the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of the file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need to be concerned with.  To get a file run the command \\\"get\\\" followed by the name of the file you want, for example:   get INDEX or  get noduty  After the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:   Transfer complete.  19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)  You can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive. You can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the file you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025 you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first and then retrieve it:   cd congress/103rd  get HR1025  Once you're finished you can log off with the command:   quit  If you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little different.  First of all you should find out if the file already exists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above and look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry.  The index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba directory.  For example:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- File: whitemanslaw  White Man's Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985 Reason magazine ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Once you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry, login and change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once you are in the incoming directory use the command:   put file_name  In this case:   put whitemanslaw  Again there'll be a \\\"Transfer complete, so many bytes transfered in so many seconds\\\" message.  Now your file is on the archive machine.  Another thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure there isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same as the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you'll overwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message].  Your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a file by the same name in the rkba directory.  Once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for the INDEX file and I will add it to the file.  If you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute a file email the file to me and I'll take care of the rest.  If you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so be sure to let me know first.  If you have any questions feel free to ask me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --  Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com     \",\"Hello fellow humans, and other net creatures...   If you're at all interested in this merchandise, please e-mail me: djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu   I'm compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system, so I have two monitors and cards for sale. Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces, I'm just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from one screen.   I'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas (within driving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but I CAN ship to you if you don't live near here. Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxes for the monitors, but I'm confident that my few months of full-time service in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and flip it in your direction.

Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 meg SIMMS).   Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking **$525** (shipping included this time, it's just a card). Original box and packaging.

In practice?  The technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key.  If the frequency path depends on they key, as I understand it to, it *could* be made effectively impossible to record.  Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule today.  But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain cellular calls and then ask a judge, \\\"Hey, can we have permission to listen to those tapes?\\\" can they?   Yes, that is a major concern, but I think that they think they can win just by having 99.5% of the USA use this system.  They don't even have to care about the cautious .5% that's left.  They don't catch the really smart crooks anyway.

They like this enough that they are dropping the so called \\\"Digital Telephony\\\" proposal, according to rumours.

(formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in the process of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0  and C Exponent Graphics 2.0.  (Both X Exponent Graphics and C Exponent Graphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through  June 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with  ansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge  tape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products.   X Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts:   1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types    available through a large collection of X resources. 2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers. 3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization. 4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback. 5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget     library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar     to X programmers. 6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge's UIM/X product.    This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical    layout of an application.   C Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts:   1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library    is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C    standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C. 2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse     interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control    with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization. 3. Large collection of high-level application functions for \\\"two-call\\\"    graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available    with minimal programming effort. 4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling    the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot    the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can     control the event loop.

I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++, and a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examination of Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the toolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and I have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result in significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which looks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance, but the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly not significantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews looks promising, but I haven't found a free version with Motif support, and I'm not confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted, and what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  The other libraries produce code which is less Motif-like, but which does not make sufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task.  At this point, my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in C, and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited to my specific task.  Later, if OSF or some credible standards-setting body comes up with a C++ interface to Motif, I will change to that.  It does me no goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry directions.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both useless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the only library I'd consider right now, but in our environment, we'd end up spending nearly $5000 to use it, and I can't justify it when it's likely to cause short-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction, and is unlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits at the high end of the J curve.  - Brad\",\"Since I have some free time while looking for a job I thought  I would offer Linux on disk and tape for those who need it.

The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits  for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution.   The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed  unsafe under federal air quality laws.        \\\"People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to  exacerbate that inflammation,\\\" said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental  Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  \\\"When people are on  the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over  the edge.\\\"       The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits  with daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter  of 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because  they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of  compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10  exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.        In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at  levels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30  microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with  asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.        The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory  Disease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung  Association's medical section.        The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that  particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study  by Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles  may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.   Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms  and bronchitis in children.        \\\"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\\\"  says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"But more and more research is showing that particles are  bad actors as well.\\\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate  air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.

Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with  asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.      \\\"In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only  cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's  rarely particulate matter,\\\" says Dr.  Schwartz.  \\\"However, PM10 doesn't have  to be near its violation range to be unhealthy.\\\"                                HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993                 NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma  The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on  Diagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in  dermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance  techniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care  professionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological  characteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management,  and followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi  and their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in  preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.  Following 2 days of  presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel  weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement.    Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a  distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins;  (2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential  for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical  excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and  extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4)  patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high  risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely;  (5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for  melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education  and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality  from melanoma.

Within the program, there are four types  of cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily  in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on  clinical research; \\\"comprehensive\\\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a  multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community  outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer  prevention and control research.    Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was  the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new  cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage  of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened  the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and  cancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew  progressively.    In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today,  there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria  for comprehensive status.    To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an  institution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly  established in 1990, the eight criteria for \\\"comprehensiveness\\\" include the  requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in  several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong  program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings  into clinical practice.    Moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly  beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also  referred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting  the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass  strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials,  significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important  outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of  sources.    The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and  capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit  important new findings or address timely research questions.

These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers  engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators  and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications  from new discoveries in the laboratory.    Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and  clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently  incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their  overall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today.    Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely  structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and  control research.  These centers interface with state and local public health  departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention  and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions  responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.   Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with  institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community  hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials.    Together, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward  creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through  interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the  laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

The  decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to  test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of  Health, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and   Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the  therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies  including Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH  that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is  intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the   replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's  reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the  MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.   \\\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the  next 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\\\" said Shalala.    Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine  Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had  convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested  simultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of  multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two  years.  ==================================================================       HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  \\\"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV\\\" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol.  114, No. 14, P. 18        AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was  approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome,  the manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the  drug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that  although HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk  of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit   disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of  the three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the  drug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S.  researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials,  many argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients  experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of   AIDS symptoms.

One slightly off the subject case in point. My brother got stung by a bee. I know he is allergic to bee stings, but that his reaction is severe localized swelling, not anaphylactic shock.

I would not be surprised in the least to find out the SOME people have bad reactions to MSG, including headaches, stomachaches and even vomiting.

I would suggest that you take your code, and submit it to comp.sys.mac.binaries to be distributed (including to the ftp sites).  Many folks, myself included, would enjoy the extra code.   Just to clarify, the 3D routines that are mentioned in various places on the mac are in a libray, not the ROM of the mac.  A few years ago before I knew anything about implementing graphics, I came across a demo of the Apple GrafSys3D library and it actually did a lot.  However, it is quite limited in the sense that it's a low-level 3D library; your code still has to plot individual points, draw each line, etc ad nauseum.  It has nothing on GL, for example, where you can handle objects.  Other things to consider when talking about Apple's old 3D GrafSys library:  * Unsupported;  never was and no plans exist to do so in the future  * Undocumented; unless you call header files documentation...  If one knows something about graphics, you could probably figure it out, but I'd assume there's better software available that gives better output and is, at the same time, programmatically nicer (i.e. easier to program).

David N. Bixler    Auburn University\",\"Several recent posts have identified the English word 'Easter' with the Babylonian goddess 'Ishtar'.  'Easter' is a pagan word all right, but it has nothing to do with Ishtar. If 'Easter' and 'Ishtar' were related, their history would show it. But in Old English, Easter was 'Eostre', cognate with English 'East' and German 'Ost'.   The reconstructed Proto-Germanic form is 'Austron'. Not until after 1400 did 'Easter' have a high front vowel like 'Ishtar'. Clearly, the two words have quite separate origins.  There may be neo-pagans who worship Ishtar at Easter, but if so, they are making either a mistake of etymology, or a deliberate play on words.  -- Michael Covington  (Ph.D., linguistics)   \",\"[...] henrik]  Country.

What do henrik] want them to do. Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them.  News reports I've seen say otherwise both location and motives wise.   CAPS don't change facts.  BM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment, BM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it BM] is a part of it.    henrik]   Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged  henrik]   training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.  So?  Should I, at this point break into caps and start talking about  DEFENSE etc.?  I don't know how 'fully engaged' Turkey is/was though.  henrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000  henrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the  henrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending  henrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION.   BM] Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them BM]  within their borders?    henrik] Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into  henrik] the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.  So I hear.  This justifies bloodshed N years after the fact?  henrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the  henrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER  henrik] OCCUR again.  BM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?  henrik] It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped henrik] into Armenia if SHE could.  Why would Turkey do that?  Do you not realize that this is a local clash that Turkey never wished to see happen?  Turkey has other plans for region, like economic revival, co-operation etc.  Good stuff in other words,  I'd be happy to bicker with Armenians over trade barriers and such on USENET rather than 'who killed whom in what way' which I detest doing and wouldn't  do.    BM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header BM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?    henrik]    Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many henrik]    cases, HISTORY repeats itself.   Even if one buys into your implicit premise, the sane thing to do would be to try not to provoke Turkey as was done in '74.  If there'd been a democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in Athens at the time, everybody would have stayed home with their families.  [I have no wish to go into the Cyprus quarrel, but I suspect what I've said is not only accurate but also palatable to all parties involved]  BM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes  BM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring BM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians  BM] are attacking Azeri towns.  henrik]    So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey henrik]    wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!  So what do you think we want?  War, death and destruction?    henrik]    I will believe it when I see it.  No, if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it.  henrik]  Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing henrik]to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?   This kind of childish rhetoric doesn't help anthing.  henrik]  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the henrik]  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean henrik]  BURNING people ALIVE !  Now, some Azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff perpetrated by Armenians.  One should re-hash stuff like this often to keep the hatred alive, right?  BM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  BM]futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  BM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  BM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.    henrik]    Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are  henrik]    NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY  henrik]    from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN.   Well they obviously aren't getting anywhere with their current methods of asking (not very peaceful I'd say).  BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent  BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe  BM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better  BM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?  henrik]    Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the henrik]    conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in henrik]    KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.  I don't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans. Peace isn't what's happening right now, furthermore what's happening right now isn't condusive to peace.  You can spend days and nights  raving about how 'right' the Armenian position is and I'm sure there'll be others who'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other side.  If entrenched positions lead to war, and if people want peace than they should sit down and talk about a compromise.  Armenia isn't strong enough to exercise the 'we think we're right, and we have the  bombs, so we'll do whatever we want, so there...' style of foreign  relations.  Yes you can type Stalin in caps, and give one sided atrocity stories etc. but for peace you need to be willing to talk to  the other side.  You personally can choose not to do that of course, this being just USENET.  The people in power shouldn't be so childish.   BM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes BM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of  BM] their blood and future.   henrik]    Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension henrik]    to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH henrik]    are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.  Azeri's would disagree with you on this, and the maps I've seen support what they'd be saying.  It doesn't seem likely that a solution will be reached in this manner.    BM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  BM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians BM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate  BM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in BM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for BM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading BM] inflammatory half-truths.  henrik]   It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative. I am absolutely henrik]   for it.   It didn't look it when I read your posting.  It would seem to me  that if you can spew mis-information about a boogey-man, you can also talk about how one might avoid the nastiness.  Fair?  henrik] But, in the meantime, if you do not take care of yourself, henrik] you will be WIPED out. Such as the case in the era of 1915-20 of henrik] The Armenian Massacres.  You don't realize I can say the same thing about 'The Turkish Massacres.' Yes, boys and girls, let's always talk about how bad and nasty things were. Let's do that so we're overwhelmed by anger, and let's do that so our kids will also be hateful.  Sounds crazy doesn't it?

Even blanks [which have no projectile] can cause death if the muzzle is in close proximity to the victim.  I have heard of rubber or plastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations [where the intent is crowd control, rather than close range self defense]; i've also seen reports of deaths caused by them [the British in Northern Ireland].  Use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the gravest of situations; at that point, i consider deadly [lethal] force to  be a proper reaction [and so does the law].

His equivalent average started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. So let us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 level of play.  That is good. Very good, in fact. But it probably doesn't make the top ten in the league. The 10th best EQA in the AL in 1992 was Dave Winfield's .296; Thomas was first at .350. First in the NL was Bonds, an incroyable .378; tenth was Bip Roberts, .297. But .280 is better than any season in the past five years by Joe Carter; it is about what Mattingly had in 1988 (.285); what Felix Jose had the last two years; just ahead of Time Raines' five-year average; better than Ryan Klesko's MLEs.   He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his baseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting. That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. The media would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was a good, maybe very good hitter.

We want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network.  The  copier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured the printer with the \\\"lp\\\" system using the parallel interface and can print  postscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in  turn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a  publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts  are less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of  programs, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript  with tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98  rather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that  acceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format and translating the image into postscript.  We suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality  pictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the  SCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a  warranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without  some assurance that the product will work.   Here my questions:  If anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or  parallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?  Is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is the limiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on  the printer?

Leading the first Armenian units who crossed the Ottoman  border in the company of the Russian invaders was the former Ottoman  Parliamentary representative for Erzurum, Karekin Pastirmaciyan, who  assumed the revolutionary name Armen Garo. Another former Ottoman  parliamentarian, Hamparsum Boyaciyan, led the Armenian guerrilla forces  who ravaged Turkish villages behind the lines under the nickname \\\"Murad\\\",  especially ordering that            'Kill Turks and Kurds wherever you find them and in            whatever circumstances you find them. Turkish children            also should be killed as they form a danger to the            Armenian nation.' (Hamparsum Boyadjian - 1914)[1]   [1] M. Varandian, \\\"History of the Dashnaktsutiun,\\\" p. 85.  Another former Member of Parliament, Papazyan, led the Armenian  guerrilla forces that ravaged the areas of Van, Bitlis and Mush.  In March 1915, the Russian forces began to move toward Van. Immediately, in April 11, 1915 the Armenians of Van began a revolt, massacring all  the Turks in the vicinity so as to make possible its quick and easy  conquest by Russians. Little wonder that Czar Nicholas II sent a  telegram of thanks to the Armenian Revolutionary Committee of Van in  April 21, 1915, \\\"thanking it for its services to Russia.\\\" The Armenian  newspaper Gochnak, published in the United States, also proudly  reported in May 24, 1915 that   \\\"only 1,500 Turks remained in Van the rest having been slaughtered.\\\"  Source: Hovannisian, Richard G.: Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918.

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\"   (See also Map 1.

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole   length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to   Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain   plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of   Tartar villages.

The main legal principles of the Turkish State  are summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:   \\\"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State  governed by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public  peace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;  loyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental  tenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.\\\"  Freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing the many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The fact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be attributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution. The first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856. Although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force only temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.  The 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and the right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution of 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing the power of the Parliament and the government.  The First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the occupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was abolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the occupying forces.  During the Independence War, the \\\"Turkish Grand National Assembly\\\" held their first meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new Turkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish Republic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new Constitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal  backbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a  multi-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by others in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been based on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national sovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.  \\\"Major Principles of the Constitution\\\"  The constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic within the following principles:  - The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by    law; - It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,   human rights and the objectives of Ataturk; - The language of the State is Turkish; - Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.   Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation; - Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This   power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else; - Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers; - Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the   Turkish nation; - All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,   sex, or political beliefs; - Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.  \\\"Structure of the State\\\"  In accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the principle of \\\"division of power\\\" to create a balanced and self-controlled system. The power is divided into \\\"legislative power,\\\" \\\"executive power,\\\" and \\\"judicial power,\\\" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each other (self-control).   A. Legislative Power:   The \\\"Turkish Grand National Assembly\\\" is a parliament with one House, elected  by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on  behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:   - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;  - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;  - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;  - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;  - to ratify international agreements;  - to grant amnesty or pardons.   Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral  or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is  divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is  calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age  of twenty-one can vote.   Elections are supervised by the \\\"Supreme Council of Elections,\\\" which solves  all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local \\\"Board of Election\\\"  runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the  Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among   independent judges.   B. Executive Power:   The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government  as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:   - to represent the State and the Country;  - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;  - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;  - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;  - to ratify laws and government decrees.    The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven  years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may   call for a referendum.   Executive power is exercised by the \\\"Council of Ministers,\\\" headed by the  Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the  members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval  by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their  program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)  Ministers in the Council.   Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent  \\\"administrative\\\" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or  functions against any law.   C. Judicial Power:   Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can  instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be   discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the  reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories  of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:   - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The     decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice    upon the appeal of the parties involved.  - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime    Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in    administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.    The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the    high administrative court.   The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the  \\\"Constitutional Court\\\" if they contradict the Constitution. If found  contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.

Jim,  There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is determnined. This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about- an event can have value.  The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment, from teaching, training, observation and experience and are only significant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical activity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a hill. How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to establish your values. Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any \\\"absolute\\\" sense. That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been conditioned; there is no \\\"truth\\\" content. The whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality. I didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and to be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human thought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil, etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no weight whatsoever.\",\"  Although the Hebrew expression LE'UM is used, the ID card specifically states on the 2nd page: EZRACHUT YISREALIT: Israeli citizen. This is true for all Israeli citizens no matter what their ethnicity. In the United States most official forms have RACE (Caucasian, Black, AmerIndian, etc.).   Funny, I have a number of maps and ALL of them have fixed borders.     Probably yes. So what ?      Apart from Mordechai Vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors, there was one other espionage case (the nutty professor at the Nes Ziona Biological Institute who was a K.G.B. mole) who was tried \\\"in camera\\\". I wouldn't exactly call it a state secret. The trial was simply tried behind closed doors. I hate to disappoint you but the United States has tried a number of espionage cases in camera.    Not Jews. Israeli citizens. Jordanian law is in effect in the West Bank but the KNESSET passed a law that Israeli law would be binding on Israeli citizens residing in the West Bank. These citizens could be Jews, Israeli Muslims, Druze, or Israeli Christians. It has NOTHING to do with religion.      Anyone who was registered (Jew, Muslim, Christian) could return. You might be confusing this with the census taken in June 1967 on the West Bank after the Six Day War. In *this* instance, if the Arab was not physically present he couldn't reside on the West Bank (e.g. if he had been visting Jordan).    No. Not even if you drowned him in bourbon, scotch or brandy :-)     Not true. Although a minority, there *are* some Israeli Arabs living on kibbutzim. On the other hand, at my age (42) I wouldn't be admitted to a kibbutz nor could the family join me. Not that I would be so thrilled to do so in the first place. The kibbbutz movement places candidates under rigorous membership criteria. Many Israeli Jews are not admitted.    The religious status quo in Israel has marriage and divorce  handled by the religious courts. The RABBANUT handles marriage and divorce for Jews, the Muslim SHAARIA  courts are for Muslims, the Christian denominations have their religious courts, and the Druze have their own courts. The entire religious establishment (Jewish, Muslim, Druze, Christian) wants to keep it that way.   I believe it's adjacent to a former Muslim cemetary. From what I heard (and I'd like to get feedback from Muslins  on the net) sanctity of cemetaries is not held that sancrosanct as it is held by Jews. The current Israeli Ministry of Trade and Industry on Agron Road in Jerusalem is housed in a former hotel that was built by Arabs in the 1920's on the site of an Arab cemetary.

Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, art dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendants in the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court.      The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith, a group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on them, including data from state and federal agencies.      The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the governments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a \\\"a massive spying operation.\\\"      The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000 anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the plaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.      Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.      The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that Gerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.      The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles.      The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California, which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources. It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as other unspecified damages.      Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the plaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and his wife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.      One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence Minister.      Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on him in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of Palestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.      According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both kept information on thousands of California political activists.      In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and Bullock received confidential information from the authorities.      No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing.   REUTER AC KG CM    APn  04/14 2202  ADL Lawsuit  Copyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.  By CATALINA ORTIZ  Associated Press Writer    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arab-Americans and critics of Israel sued the Anti-Defamation League on Wednesday, saying it invaded their privacy by illegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network.    The ADL, a national group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, intended to use the data to discredit them because of their political views, according to the class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court.    \\\"None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or anti-Semitism or hate crimes, or any of the other `isms' that the ADL claims to protect against. None of us is violent or criminal in any way,\\\" said Carol El-Shaieb, an education consultant who develops programs on Arab culture.    The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens, son of former Israel Defense Minister Moshe Arens. The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably because he has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians.    \\\"The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks politically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite,\\\" Arens said.    The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn't comment on the lawsuit because it hasn't reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL's New York headquarters.    The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that the ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including white supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco public television station KQED.    Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government records, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit. No charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.    The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California's privacy law, which forbids the intentional disclosure of personal information \\\"not otherwise public\\\" from state or federal records.    The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to \\\"persons and entities\\\" who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn't elaborate.    Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut, director of the ADL's office in San Francisco. He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.    Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock, an alleged ADL informant over the past four decades, and former police officer Tom Gerard. Gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed information on to Bullock.    Gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the Philippines. Bullock's lawyer, Richard Breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuit because he had not yet studied it.

He threw 2 straight fastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the first one, but Bonds hit the second one out of the park.  Then in the 3rd, when Clark was at third base with one out, Maddux did not intentionally walk Bonds, and Bonds dropped a single to left-center.       The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has not scored a run yet.  He will always hit around .300, but I'm concerning about his on-base percentage.  The key in the lineup is Matt Williams, he has to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base.         The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL.  Burba has done a superb job filling in so far, he looks like a different pitcher from last year.  However, Swift is terrible in both of his starts.  With Burba moving into the rotation, Mike Jackson is the only right-handed reliever aside from Rod Beck, he'll get a lot of actions.  I also hope that Dusty can manage his bullpen better than Roger Craig, especially on Beck. I was concerned when Beck was used for 3 straight days earlier this week.

You are correct about 'majority.'  Somewhere between 1 out of three and  one out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent  assault.  The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems like heart attack and stroke.  'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1,000,000 Americans using firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some may have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in  using firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population. (Yes, I know that is a REAL rough estimate.  We're closer to 270 million now,  but many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage if anything is low.)  At any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred  to as 'tiny' minorities, so I don't see how the other part of the group  can be referred to as the 'vast' majority.  A little more work might  support a 'simple' majority of Americans never use, own or display a firearm.  Certainly when you are talking about OWNERSHIP you are wrong.  Nearly half of your fellow citizens own one or more firearms.     Please provide a list of other means that are as effective.  Then you might  convince your local police departments to switch.

With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that their faith will survive this land.     \\\"There is a fear - a real fear, too,\\\" said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette. \\\"We have one generation to do it or to die.\\\"     Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land. But for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.     Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where \\\"historical sites\\\" are sometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great Persian Empire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ was born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three Zoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians, Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the Zoroastrian prophet.     Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are  a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a people is very much on their minds.     Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance of the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause their young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they actually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children become totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than the world at large - who will be the losers.     \\\"It's important to have an identity,\\\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose, a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \\\"It's important for everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life. You don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect. You can fall back on your own identity.\\\"     For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.     Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was only one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which translates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.  _Good vs. evil_     Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with the good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for good, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity, kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.     But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to follow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact, Joseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths, traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of Mount Hamilton, is \\\"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\\\"     So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India, where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape persecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy; the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.     About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India and Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from Iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state where others had no rights.     Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \\\"good deeds\\\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose, the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because Manou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's dedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the Zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.     The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an Iranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples in North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount Hamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto, and Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on this continent.     Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the property already had a large house that they have converted to a community center.     The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet  Zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted  ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.     Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed- in area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are  sometimes called \\\"fire worshippers,\\\" they actually consider fire just  a symbol of God.  \\\"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the  cross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\\\" Bhujwala said.     The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all Iranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With Zoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the United States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.    For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people came to worship and revel.     \\\"The good things in life are not forbidden,\\\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani, a leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed proved him right.     Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking sandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit and nuts.     Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \\\"People eat the fruit,\\\" Tarapore said.  \\\"It's a way to participate in the ceremony.\\\"  _Santa Claus, sort of_     The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white hair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green symbolic of spring) and red.     He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and played a tambourine.     The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \\\"This is all new for us, too,\\\" one told a visitor who asked what was going on.     A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with the religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have no procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their centuries of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu king who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his people's religion.     But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the San Jose temple whenever he can.     \\\"When I first heard about this religion,\\\" he said, \\\"I thought, my God, this is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.     \\\"People who don't have a tradition, something to lean on, what's the difference with the lower animals?\\\"\",\"  As a person who is very sensitive to msg and whose wife and kids are too, I WANT TO KNOW WHY THE FOOD INDUSTRY WANTS TO PUT MSG IN FOOD!!!

Adam Adam Shostack            adam@das.harvard.edu\",\"I am trying to get my system to work with a Tandberg 3600 + Future Domain TMC-1660 + Seagate ST-21M MFM controller.   The system boots up if the Tandberg is disconnected from the system, and of course no SCSI devices found (I have no other SCSI devices).  The system boots up if the Seagate MFM controller is removed from the system. The Future Domain card reports finding the Tandberg 3660 on the SCSI bus. The system then of course stops booting because my MFM hard disks can't be found.  The system hangs if all three (Tandberg, Future Domain TMC-1660 & Seagate MFM controller) are in the system.   Looks like there is some conflict between the Seagate and Future Domain card. But the funny thing is that it only hangs if the Tandberg is connected.  I have checked that there are no conflict in BIOS addresses, IRQ & I/O port. Have I missed anything?  I am lost here. Any suggestions are most welcomed. Thanks in advance.  Delman.    -- ______________________________________________________________________\",\"From the \\\"JPL Universe\\\" April 23, 1993  SIRTF is still very much in business\",\"[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.]  Gun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day with a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30. It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began, whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.  Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of \\\"election fraud\\\" to hold their jobs.  Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too many cases, who they were).  Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater of Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident.  The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner Auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive husbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room.  One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy. He said, \\\"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is always so organized every year.\\\"  I got a little pissed, and replied, \\\"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.\\\"  At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and several Simon's Rock anti-gun \\\"close-the-loophole\\\" protestors. (Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)  The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.  Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up to \\\"support GOAL's position\\\" on \\\"all bills.\\\"  First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students had some curfew, I guess).    Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock folks called the current law a \\\"loophole\\\" and wanted it closed.  Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \\\"SKS assault rifle.\\\" The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri, and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \\\"as strong as\\\" that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.  Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  \\\"In some of these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!\\\" (Oooooo!)  \\\"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't be having this situation -- but they won't.\\\"  (Naughty, naughty!)  Next up was Boston city councilman Albert \\\"Dapper\\\" O'Neill.  He was there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were judge, he'd give arrestees their \\\"last rights\\\" (pun intended) on the spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.) He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(  Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction -- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying, \\\"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted.\\\"  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.  Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable every five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible. \\\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\\\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the law-abiding instead of the crook.  The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga. Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \\\"restraining order\\\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He  was a co-sponsor of one of the \\\"restraining order\\\" bills as well.)  One of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \\\"every year it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\\\" It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been more effective.  At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue. Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was disconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \\\"public\\\" testimony; the other got a seat this time.  Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change. He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great quote: \\\"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state computer system until 1999.\\\"  (This was also an argument he used against the renewable FID card.)  Testimony was heard from several \\\"battered women,\\\" one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he got it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how 50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women needed to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long rambling circumlocution in response.  Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts. Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.  Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law. One of the junior reps noted that \\\"this is America\\\" and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga reiterated this, saying that \\\"people who abuse smaller people can go to Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order.\\\"  (Point and match, Senator.)  Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his citizenship \\\"expired every 5 years,\\\" and that a driver's license was a privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.  A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public hangings.  The speaker then responded, \\\"I'll make you a deal.  You get me the rope, and I'll tie the noose.\\\"  Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \\\"he wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside\\\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \\\"loophole\\\" should be closed to prevent something like this from \\\"ever happening again\\\".  Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of spilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually shot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on, saying, \\\"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are safe -- support gun control.\\\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \\\"Only residents can get FID's,\\\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out-of-staters completely off?)  Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by out-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident student -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental record.  One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \\\"elitist\\\".  Another (Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union had \\\"FID-type\\\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home state was \\\"not enough.\\\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming, \\\"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!\\\"  All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and GOAL's position) were:  o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull     licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)  o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)  o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly    opposed)  o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws     (opposed)  o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)  o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)  o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)  o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)  o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)  Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.  Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.  Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it. Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said, \\\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\\\"  The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It ended at about 6:30. -- \",\"The Roman Catholic conservatives are coming out in the open to line up with Pat Robertson and his ultra Right Wing Christian Coalition. Former Secretary of Education William Bennet, a Roman Catholic, stood beside the Christian Coalition's spokesman Ralph Reed at a March 3 conference in Washington.  The purpose of the conference was to publish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed to prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it backed away from the \\\"Family Values\\\" positons of the '92 convention.  Conservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson's organization with political expertise, legal assistance and high tech communications support.  The Catholic Campaign for  American, designed as a Catholic version of the Moral Majority, was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes. Ms. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom Council in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988.  Ms. Elwell was hired by Domino's Pizza magnate, Tom Monaghan, in 1989 to manage Legatus, a \\\"nonpolitical\\\", Catholic businessmen's group. Membership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least $4 million in annual revenues.  Relying on a network of wealthy contacts at Legatus, Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the Catholic Campaign.  The Campaign's list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep. Robert K. Dornan, Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, the lovely Pat Buchanan and Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus.   Also on the national committee is Keith Fournier, a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice.  Another Catholic, Thomas Patrick Monaghan, senior counsel of Robertson's ACLJ, is also an active supporter of the Catholic Campaign.  The board of directors includes Frank Shakespeare, broadcasting exec and former U.S. ambassador to the Pope, Wall Street executive Frank Lynch, former Reagan official Richard V. Allen, Bishop Rene Gracida of Corpus Christi and Mary Ellen Bork, wife of unsuccessful Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port         2. X terminals         3. NeXT         4. Silicon Graphics         5. IBM RS/6000  6. Other stuff      1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port   If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard  (Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding  a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation  runs the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used  PC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable  to your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read  the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.   The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.   a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and  even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server  extension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your  server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings  appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,  you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,  or bugging your vendor.   kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.  Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.   Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.      2. X terminals   Also, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use  PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all  set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the  trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add  extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around  for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.      3. NeXT   NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop  Bus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they  were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of  upgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!      4. Silicon Graphics   Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and  beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't  believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not  possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by  upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more  details.      5. IBM RS/6000   IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||  Unfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||  cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||  smaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||  it or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||  works.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||  told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||  anything new, please send me e-mail.        ||          6. Other stuff   Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)  support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your  queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can  get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either  from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in  luck.  Contact the companies for more details.   Apple Adjustable Keyboard     Apple Computer, Inc.     Sales offices all over the place.      Availability: February, 1993     Price: $219     Supports: Mac only      Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The     keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate     backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are     arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.      The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.     A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.      The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not     directly attachable to the keyboard.      As soon as soda comes back up, I'll have a detailed blurb from     TidBITS available there.

Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products.     Most (if not all) of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles     (including PS/2's and other MicroChannel boxes).  They sell you     a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number     of popular word processors and spreadsheets.      Each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions     to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  Multiple     people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file     for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.     On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between     words.  Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute.     I don't have specs on the DragonWriter 1000.      The DragonDictate-30K can recognize 30,000 words at a time.     The DragonWriter 1000 can recognize (you guessed it) 1000 words at a time.

Source: 'The Times,' 3 March 1992  MASSACRE UNCOVERED....  By ANATOL LIEVEN,  More than sixty bodies, including those of women and children, have  been spotted on hillsides in Nagorno-Karabakh, confirming claims  that Armenian troops massacred Azeri refugees. Hundreds are missing.  Scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley  and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday's  massacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees.  From that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of  Askeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters  of Agdam. Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their  own lines.  We landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last  troops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out.  They left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov,  who oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, flew to Stepanakert  to ease their departure.  A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their  dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest. All the  same, two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian  positions.  In all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another  31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days. These figures  do not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed  the Azerbaijani town of Khodjaly on Tuesday night. The figures also  do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies  Zahid Jabarov, a survivor of the massacre, said he saw up to 200  people shot down at the point we visited, and refugees who came  by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and  of leaving a trail of bodies along their path. Around the bodies  we saw were scattered possessions, clothing and personnel documents.  The bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre.  All are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly  clothing of workers.  Of the 31 we saw, only one policeman and two apparent national  volunteers were wearing uniform. All the rest were civilians,  including eight women and three small children. TWO GROUPS,  APPARENTLY FAMILIES, HAD FALLEN TOGETHER, THE CHILDREN CRADLED  IN THE WOMEN'S ARMS.  SEVERAL OF THEM, INCLUDING ONE SMALL GIRL, HAD TERRIBLE HEAD  INJURIES: ONLY HER FACE WAS LEFT. SURVIVORS HAVE TOLD HOW THEY  SAW ARMENIANS SHOOTING THEM POINT BLANK AS THEY LAY ON THE GROUND.

The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different forms in the religions of antiquity.  The problem was not the resurrection which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population  (the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem was that Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the state operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism  becomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this, and were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile, and hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since Christians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is seen by Nero's blaming them for the burning of Rome.

EDT                     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good afternoon.                Q   Could we do this on the lawn?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would be nice.  Let's go out  to the cherry blossoms.  We'll do like the President.              Q   Is the stimulus package dead?               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.                Q   Can you tell us more about the Dole talks?  You  said it was a good visit, but no compromise.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  The President had a good talk  with Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before, there  were no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very  good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as  well.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe  Tuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not  speak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the  President was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close  of that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the  President about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked  about that yesterday afternoon.              At the close of that discussion they said that they  would have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator  was up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific  compromises made on either side, they did say that they would  continue to have some discussions.  And that's where we are.              Q   Well, who is giving in?  Where is it standing --are  both making concessions?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that it's at that  phase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said  consistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.   He believes in the package, but he believes that if it's going to  take adjustments to get the minority to release it, he's willing to  make those adjustments.              Q   On the subject of a VAT --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, boy.              Q   Can we stay on this for one more minute?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.              Q   We have a problem with the five minutes --              Q   I know no decisions have been made, but what would  lead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sorry, Andrea, I'm not going to go  down that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said  this morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a  number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked  at.  The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been  made.              Q   To follow, have they done that directly through  him?  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President  about it?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, although  there's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the  VAT.  But the President has not made a decision.              Q   At the meetings that he's had with his own task  force advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the  possible options would be?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that that has been  presented for a decision, no.              Q   Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an  option?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, there are a lot of levels of  briefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the  President as, okay, this is something for you to decide on.                Q   You're not saying he didn't know it was being  considered, though, are you?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he said it's being considered.              Q   He knew that.              Q   But has he discussed that with his advisers?   That's what I'm asking.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said it's being  considered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been  over the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I  don't even know that it's --              Q   But he didn't say he was considering, did he, at  this stage?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he is not.  I think we're  getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is  considered --               Q   Well, he is the one who said, I haven't reviewed  it.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just  repeated.               Q   George, is there any concern here that as a result  of the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if  it were to be considered he'd let us know, and having it trickle out  the way it did, that there may now be the development of a  credibility gap on this issue and others?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.  I mean, it is  now public knowledge that this is being considered.              Q   Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute  statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it  was off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it  come out not from you people, but --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out  from the administration.  What are you talking about?              Q   What I'm saying is, though, that the President said  he would let us know.               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.              Q   You people then said -- you said, I believe, that  it's not going to be on the program.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th.              Q   On March 25th.               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change.              Q   Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out  by rooting around in the fine print of an interview              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do  a very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is -- (laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of  Health and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys  write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the  Clinton administration, the headline is -- I'll look at it right  here, and AP story -- \\\"Clinton wants more money for spying.\\\"              Q   What about his remark that if it were being  considered, he'd tell us about it?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration's concerned,  and he'd let you know.              Q   And did he?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say  this morning?              Q   It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn't have to be dragged out of  me.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of  Health of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his  administration.  That is his administration policy.              Q   Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they  orchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they  answered the questions.              Q   You're saying here that it didn't have to be  dragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were  considering it.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.   Painfully clear.              Q   Was there a particular political strategy in making  it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax  day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being  considered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they  answered that it was being considered.              Q   George, The New York Times --              Q   Why do it yesterday?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked.              Q   The New York Times reports today that Secretary  Reich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and  oranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures  in a way that was supportive of the President's job stimulus bill,  but which turned out to be totally false.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it was totally  false, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor  Department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they  say that.               Q   The question is, is the President concerned about  behavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what's he  doing about it, if so?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a  mistake was made, it won't happen again, and that's the end of the  matter.              Q   Isn't that the same information that goes to the  President?              Q   If I could go back to the stimulus package --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's two separate pieces of  information.  I think that's where the confusion was.              Q   When did you all first learn about this mistake  that was made?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning.              Q   And as far as you know, is the President aware of  it?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so.              Q   And was he aware of it before he read about it in  The New York Times?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  Not to my knowledge.              Q   Did you ever hear about it before this morning?   Anything?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't.              Q   Wasn't the President given an erroneous spin on  this for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I'm not sure.  Both  statements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that  mixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said  it was a mistake.  They said they wouldn't do it again.              Q   Did they drop it -- is this something that you  choose to spin or make an issue of?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of  work, we're gratified.  But that doesn't take away from the need to  get this jobs package going.              Q   If I could go back to the stimulus package for a  minute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an  amendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment  would be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in  the conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting  that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there's no  changes in the schedule at all.  I don't know that they discussed the  timing like that.              Q   Do you believe that you're closer or getting closer  this week than you were last week?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we're going  to pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make  adjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don't know where the  votes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don't know what's  going to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes  deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.              Q   Has there been any indication that this situation  has changed?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work on  it.  We'll know when the votes are taken.              Q   George, last week you said that there are -- or  various people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go  through Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because  he was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the  compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could  accept.  This week you're talking to him.  Is that because you've  realized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's because Senator Dole wanted  to talk to the President about the stimulus package.              Q   He initiated the conversation?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact,  the President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You  say he's making --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that that's exactly  what he said.  I think he said he didn't have any indication that  there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise,  and the President doesn't want to compromise.  And the President  doesn't want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get  it through, he will.              Q   Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was  working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before  the actual vote.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's possible.              Q   Today?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when that will  happen, but I think that it's very possible that we'll come forward  with some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come  forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it  passed.              Q   As we understood his conversations with Dole, the  first one was some discussion of this and I'll get back to you  tonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase  is.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a question of how  detailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the  package last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday  afternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today  in the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator  Dole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific  compromises at this date.  When we have something we'll let you know.   And I'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that  we've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard way.              Q   What are the follow-up discussions if not the  President and Dole?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going  to talk to Senator Dole.              Q   Is that a threat?  (Laughter.)              Q   Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right,  how about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the  President, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was a negotiation  in that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.              Q   Did they discuss actual numbers?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.  I know they  talked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked  about the programs they cared about.  I don't know if they got to the  level of this many x-billion dollars.               Q   Does Dole have to sign off before there is a  package?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not.              Q   Did the White House have anything to do with the  protesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole  was speaking?  Was that in any way organized by --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.              Q   And has the President been in touch with Senators  Kohl or Feingold?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he's talked to them,  no.              Q   George, is the President considering the more  palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the  haves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going  to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves  having to pay for the have-nots?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that  the tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his  budget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your  question, I'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday.              Q   George, on the subject of accuracy in information,  you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money  that would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is  not true.  It's actually waste water money.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's waste water money for  Wisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee.               Q   But it would not affect the drinking water problem  because it's waste water money, right?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment  overall.               Q   But the implication from your statement the other  day was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.   Would you agree that's not the case?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure of the specifics.  I  know that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.              Q   A leftover question from this morning, which was,  when did the President find out that the task force was deliberating  on a VAT?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when.  I just  don't know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between  the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.                Q   So sometime since March 25th?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's right.  I don't know  the exact date.              Q   George, the President this morning mentioned that  some labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the  National Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax  being okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel  that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed,  or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already  proposed?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we've said all we have to  say about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there's just no -- this is  being considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.   The President hasn't made any further decisions beyond that.               Q   But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn't  be to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn't replace the  income tax, for instance?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on  that.              Q   In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress,  Senator Dole's press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you  think -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it  have a chance?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea.               Q   Is that a consideration whether you all put it  forward?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration  if the President were to decide to do it.  It's not in consideration  now.              Q   You said at the beginning of the briefing that  circumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under  consideration.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to  this morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something  that has to be considered.              Q   Those are the circumstances that have changed?   That's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled  it out that groups have asked it to be considered?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what he said.               Q   Is that true?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin  taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to get into the  deliberations.              Q   But, George --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as  the President said, groups came forward and said this is something  you ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it.               Q   Is that the only thing that's changed since his  prior statement and your prior statement on the VAT?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Can you explain how those groups -- how that  information got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading  the newspaper or did groups make presentations?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know,  the health care task force has met with dozens of groups.              Q   But this is the President's knowledge that these  groups had come forward.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what  was coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been  published positions in the newspapers.              Q   Have certain groups briefed him on the group's  presentations to them?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've briefed him  -- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the  working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these  groups.              Q   What kind of arguments did the groups make that  were persuasive enough that the President would change the position  that he had enunciated previously?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know, it's just they've had  longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance  health care.              Q   The President wasn't aware of those longstanding  positions?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.   Obviously, he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the  basic arguments for and against a VAT tax.              Q   What we're trying to figure out here -- you're  telling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this  change in the President's attitude toward the VAT between February  and now --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's attitude hasn't  necessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision.              Q   I know, but the President said that it was off the  table.  So did you.  And you're saying that the only thing that's  changed is the positions of these groups, except you're also  describing them as longstanding positions.  I don't see the change.   If these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been  made to the President --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they've made the  presentations to the health care task force.              Q   There's no relationship at all between the fact  that sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he  favored will not produce enough revenue to finance --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he ever suggested  that they would produce all the revenue.              Q   Well, he suggested that he thought that those were  appropriate ways to finance health care.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don't know that  he said anything to refute that.              Q   But, in fact, has the task force discovered that  there wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind  of core benefits --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't think that the task  force ever suggested that there would.              Q   George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break  his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his  programs?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't comment on a hypothetical  situation.                 Q   But does that promise -- would that promise not to  raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him  from seeking a VAT tax?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions  on the VAT tax.  When he does, we'll tell you and we'll explain the  implications then.              Q   Which specific groups can you cite -- business,  labor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task  force has prompted this consideration?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have the specific.  I just  don't have that.              Q   George, can you tell us to what extend these other  alternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or  other financing options are also still on the table and what these  options are?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force  and representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking  at a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that  there are 20 different options under consideration.  But I'm not  going to comment --              Q   What's the scope --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not going to comment on  them, no.              Q   What's the scope of the need?  How much are you  talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the  --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what the health care task  force is looking at.              Q   Since there's not going to be any briefing on the  Miyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the  President hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his  task complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and  the remark about market access at the press conference?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note?              Q   Does no mean yes.              Q   Yes and no.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know.  I saw the  Prime Minister's press conference where he was asked the question  about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when  he was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that  certainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the  President.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and  the U.S. that we want to do something about.              Q   Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he  suggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in  terms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state  our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit  very clearly.  I don't necessarily want to agree with your  characterization of the Prime Minister's comments.              Q      that we need specific export targets, specific  numerical targets -- is that what he's going to discuss with  Miyazawa?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're going to have a broad  discussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don't want to get into  those specifics until after the meeting.              Q   Why?              Q    That's the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or  not -- does the President believe that without specific numerical  targets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of  hopeless that this is going to change very much?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must  have pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not  want to get into the specifics of how that would be done.              Q   But does the President believe that their stimulus  package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants  to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister  Miyazawa himself, and then he'll make the comment on it.              Q   How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to  be some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary  Christopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do  more, the Japanese saying that that's not what they heard?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we're going to continue to  work with all our allies in the G-7, and we're going to continue to  press for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I  think that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and  we're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral  packages.              Q   Do you think the Japanese need to do more?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work  with all our allies to do as much as we can.              Q   Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today  Show this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher's comments on  the Bosnia policy.  And he said, \\\"It's a rather emotional response.\\\"         MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue.              Q   Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White   House condone that kind of remark?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary  Christopher's remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also  that this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find  answers for.               Q   But that specific -- \\\"rather emotional response\\\" --  specific term?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself.              Q   In connection with that, doesn't it seem that with  the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it  good American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now  to help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example?              Q   To take stronger action, to take military action --  air strikes, anything that can be done?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what  must be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as  you know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms  embargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase  pressure at this time.              Q   What is your response to the critics who would say  that the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain  the presidency?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're wrong.  We're pressing hard  for the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We're pressing hard  for increased sanctions, and we're talking to our allies about the  arms embargo.              Q   You were putting great store in Vance and Owen  getting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said  that military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that  change your thinking?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we're going to listen to  whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to  say.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions  and talking about the arms embargo.              Q   A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She  said she would be able to provide some administration officials who  could document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are  you going to be able to do that, or do you have anything --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's what she said.              Q   That's exactly what she said.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's true.  But  what she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of  evidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are  connections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and  we are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have  an effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute,  what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact  effect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods  into Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What  kind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don't  know.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at  all, I don't know why they'd be fighting it so much.              Q   Are the First Lady's tax returns going to be  released?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a joint tax return.   And it will be probably later today.              Q   Is the President considering signing an executive  order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work  force as part of the gay rights march here next week?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think there's any proposal  for that at this time, not that I know of.              Q   It's something that the President promised during  the campaign that he would do.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don't  think it's anything that's on his plate right now.              Q   Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point  on this issue?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about on this issue.   I assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian  community sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of  different groups and communities.              Q   Do you know if that's scheduled --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's probably going to be tomorrow.              Q   Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.)              Q   It's a good thing you asked.              Q   Who's probably going to be there?  (Laughter.)              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.              Q   How long --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  That's all I know.              Q   Do you know if it's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?   (Laughter.)              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what time it is.  I  don't even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow.              Q   Environmental groups have asked him to make a major  speech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've asked, but  I think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to  give a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it's not  exactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like  that.              Q   Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of  the biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know the specific  timing of something like that, but it's certainly something under  discussion and something we've been working on.              Q   Campaign finance reform?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on it.              Q   Do you think it will be next week?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.              Q   The biodiversity treaty is something you're working  on?  I missed the question.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, something we're working on.   He asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn't know  anything about that but it's something we've certainly been working  on.              Q   Do you know what organizations might be represented  in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't.              Q   Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out  of town on the day of the march?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got to be at the Senate  meeting in Jamestown, and I believe he's also going to be giving a  speech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston  on Sunday, as he did last year.              Q   Would you have told us if she had not pressed you  on the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On what?              Q   On the gays.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  When we went through the  President's schedule for the day, certainly.              Q?     George, what day is the publisher's speech?  Is  that Sunday?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a Sunday.              Q   And Saturday he'll be in Jamestown?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   So you're just going to be in Jamestown for one  day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I'm not sure.  I don't know how  long the Senate thing goes.  It might go overnight.  I just don't  know.              Q   You would have made the gay meeting public, right?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain if we had the meeting  -- I don't know about open to the press, but we would have told you  about it.              Q   I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the  first time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't say it was going to be in  the Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  But I didn't -- I'm not say that it's  not, but I didn't say that it was.  (Laughter.)              Q      at the White House in the Bush administration  gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White  House had to repudiate having done that.  So I just wanted to make  sure --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President wouldn't do  anything like that.              Q   Certainly not.              Q   What marching orders did the President give to  General Vessey?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They had a very good discussion for  about half an hour today.  He wanted -- the most important thing was  he had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs.  He will  obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document.   The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting  and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes  in our policy towards Vietnam.  He'll be looking at Vietnam's  response to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look  into investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on  remains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to  military archives.                And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the  activities of the joint commission and on the document.              Q   Vietnam says it's a fake.  What is the DOD analysis  at this stage?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's not completed yet, and it's  also the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the  Vietnamese.              Q   A number of Defense officials have been saying that  they think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact,  non-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to  as Americans from time to time.  Do people --               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We don't have any final  determination.  We're going to wait for the complete review; when we  have it, we'll make a judgment.              Q   I know you don't have any final determination, but  given all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that  that's a likely possibility?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't want to characterize  it in any way until the review is complete.              Q   George, was there a topic scheduled for the speech  in Boston?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.               Q   Is the President going to have a press conference  tomorrow with Miyazawa?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so, but I'm not positive.   Yes, I expect, yes.              Q   Was Toon in with Vessey?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.               Q   He was in on the meeting?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   What was the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey,  and the answer is yes.               Q   Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal  report this morning the President's distressed about some of his  press clippings and that perhaps he's distressed with you about that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  Well, I do have a response.  I  think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied  that the President has had restricted access to the press.  I would  point out that he's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than  any of his predecessors. I would also point out it also --              Q   How many questions?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Three hundred fifty-eight, on 77  occasions.              Q   How many were while he was jogging?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, that's actually a very  good question, Andrea.  And I would point out further that the  article also implied that these questions were only answered at  tightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.   He's had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval  Office or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to  questions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the --              Q   Oval Office press conference -- when was that?               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's answered questions in the -- East Room.  He's had five in the East Room, he's had one in the Oval  Office, he's had one in the Rose Garden, he's had one or two in the  Roosevelt Room.  And this is just to the White House, Washington  Press Corps.  In addition to that, he's had 17 interviews with local  television anchors.  He's met with the editorial board of The  Portland Oregonian.  He's had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather.  He's had interviews with local press from California, Florida and  Connecticut --              Q   Can you address the question of the attitude?  The  article implies that he doesn't --              Q   Why doesn't he like us?  (Laughter.)              Q   Did you really get blamed for that Post story?              Q   The story is that you -- are you held responsible  for it.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think I'm going to comment  about this.              Q   Are you denying that the President has shown  displeasure publicly?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I am not commenting on the  discussions between the President and myself.              Q   Did the President write that letter to Chris  Webber?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What?              Q   The letter to the University of Michigan basketball  player?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, yes.              Q   That is an authentic letter?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Since the President first talked about the VAT in  February, he said at the time that he thought there probably should  be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.   Does he still hold that position given the impact it could have?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I just can't comment on a  proposal he hasn't made.              Q   George, does the President have some agenda for  this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think it will just a  general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about  including AIDS and other issues -- civil rights.              Q   The military issue?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain it will come up.              Q   Is he using this event to name the AIDS --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.              Q   George, what specifically is the President doing to  prepare for tomorrow's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's had briefing memos.  He's had  general discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the  Trade Representative and others.              Q      report yet?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he has the report  referred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him  today.              Q   He was?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Does he intend to use any of these instances that  --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know that the  report's been presented.  But obviously, the President will press  hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred.              Q   In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was  that there's a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he  feels that way?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the  record in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again,  I think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.  The  thrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the  President may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he  has the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent  history.        Q   Can we come up to your office?  (Laughter.)        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If you're invited.                THE PRESS:  Thank you.                                   END                    1:34 P.M. EDT\",\"I want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around 5 megabytes / sec for very large data transfers.  (Around 5 MB.)  I have a Quadra 950.  I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.          (using block-mode transfers) I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can          achieve 6.8 MB/s.  Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.  It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer, then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s result in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)  So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer,   Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer. Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer. Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.         ... Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer. Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card.  Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously, and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho') each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.  Why?  Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time.) Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use the same bus to mac RAM?  Is there anything I can do?\",\"Hmm, followup on my own posting... Well, who cares.  First let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the Clipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:  The chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs general encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB ECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm consists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data seems to be 64 Bit? Yes. So if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when  Clipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key.  (Or is it one key per direction ?) They can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however. Somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip which is now ready to work. The clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits. These 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number with 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip) At beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??) before sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper chip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number, and the session key. This might look like X{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number} where X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key. This family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???) After that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet being encrypted and decrypted by Clipper.  Denning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160 Bit's.  Now, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not being an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in this scheme, which might be exploited by several parties.  As far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the  obvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing the serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can't imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources for the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money.  Then, the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security could (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits each, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let's simply assume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or law enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrows and l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on and so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding chip is compromised forever. Not very clever, IMHO [ :-)) ]. How about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that the police (or whoever) want's to listen to? Escrows could then simply decode this session-key and send it back to police. (And would naturally not do this after the warrant has expired...) This would be a better technical solution, but I guess politics will not work that way.  Apparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes of intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter- cept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes the right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over there, I have no idea who is allowed to tap, and who not) This certainly means that watched communi- cations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company to the FBI, if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this means as far as I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching- company, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-key will not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable by anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis!  What do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ECB mode, and the first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the session key would not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. Shouldn't be so difficult to do *that* :^)  And now a last point, for the other side. After all I have read and heard about Clipper (not the programming language for dBase, is it ? [:-)]) it seems to have many advantages, which shold not be overseen!   Now an afterthought to your rights. Please note that I have no idea what I am talking about!!!

From the March 1993 \\\"Aero Vision\\\" (The newsletter for the Employees of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace at Huntington Beach, California).      SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY      \\\"On Monday, March 15 at noon, Quest Aerospace Education, Inc.   launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.   The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz, director and   SSTO program manager, and the second by Air Force Captain Ed   Spalding, who with Staff Sgt. Don Gisburne represents Air Force   Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for   potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were   successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria   and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the   cafeteria.      Quest's Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the   McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the   McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude   of 300 feet.  The Space Clippers can be used in educational   settings to teach mathematics and science, as well as social   studies and other applications.  The Space Clipper is available   either in the $35 Space Clipper outfit, which includes everything   needed for three launches, or as individual rockets for $12 each.   Both are available through hobby shops or by calling 1-800-858-   7302.\\\"    By the way -- this is not an endorsement to buy the product nor is it an advertisement to buy the product.

For   crying out loud, how do these turkeys think they can talk to customers   this way and still stay in business? Again, I don't expect sales people to   bow, scrape, and grovel in my presence but I sure don't expect to be   abused either. I was very surprised by the way the sales people talked to   me and in other 'negotiating' sessions I overheard in neighboring sales   cubicles. Evidently, their success rate is high enough that they continue   to do business this way. There must be a lot of people out there who are   easy to intimidate.  On the other hand, I'm not sure about the 'one price, no haggling'   approach that Saturn and other are starting to use. I guess if their fixed   price is fair it's OK. Maybe the best approach is to do your homework   before you go in. Find out the invoice prices of the car, add a reasonable   profit for the dealer ($200-$300??), offer them that price and stick to   it. If they get abusive, just leave.

British promised to Venizelos (greek PM) that mainly greek populated areas of the Ottomans will be given to Greece, _if_ he will agree to drag Greece in the side of the British during the WWI (because the greek King was proGerman). The British succeeded by bombarding Athens (1916), killing quite a few, forcing abdication of the King, division of Greece into two separate states (North-South), and finally laying the ground for the most disasterous division between greeks for our century.(So don't feel bitter that the \\\"Allies\\\" gave any green light because they liked us....)  Anyway, the British succeed to establish Venizelos, war starts at a second front against the Germans in the south while they were fighting the war in the East against the Russians, and finally the WWII came in an end. After that the British (and French) forgot immediately their promises (as usually). Even though publicly they say that they support the Greek cause, practically they not only do nothing, but instead, using some usual \\\"reasoning\\\" and other crap rhetoric as a pretext, they gradually backup Kemal (who had given now to the British \\\"water and bread\\\" that he will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a small ethnic-state). The main drive behind this British switch was the plan to keep a Muslim state in the region as buffer against a Russian expansion into warm-water facilities. The \\\"greek empire\\\" being an Orthodox Christian state was too prone to become Russian client.  Out of this intrigue, the current state of affairs was established on our lands. While Venizelos and Kemal were promoted as true \\\"Giants\\\" by the British, since they worked to realize their goals in the region. Under the same plan, currently Greece and Turkey are recipients of big military funds from the US; both they are functioning as anti-Russian buffers, while simultaneously both remain good clients of State Dept. because otherwise the use of terror of changing \\\"the balance of power in the Aegean\\\" will be used.

I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That Spoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make no reference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of resurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what the point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work  _Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ Cambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul here has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there is no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared, no ascension either.  Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the grave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts until well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up with a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly, I think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts before this which mention the tomb).         You are quite right here.  Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the foundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable. See B.

Of course, I said \\\"No problem\\\" and went to work. Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during  installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit  Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted  with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if  I could access the drive.

THOSE INTREPID ISRAELI SOLDIERS       Israeli soldiers have sexually taunted Arab women in the occupied Gaza Strip   during the three-week-long closure that has sealed Palestinians off from the   Jewish state, Palestinian sources said on Sunday.    The incidents occurred in the town of Khan Younis and involved soldiers of  the Golani Brigade who have been at the centre of house-to-house raids for  Palestinian activists during the closure, which was imposed on the strip and  occupied West Bank.    Five days ago girls at the Al-Khansaa secondary said a group of naked  soldiers taunted them, yelling: ``Come and kiss me.'' When the girls fled,   the soldiers threw empty bottles at them.        On Saturday, a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their  pants when they saw girls from Al-Khansaa walking home from school. Parents   are considering keeping their daughters home from the all-girls school.        The same day, soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth  escaped from them at a boys' secondary school. Deputy Principal Srur   Abu-Jamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls, backed them   against a wall, and put their arms around them.    When teacher Hamdan Abu-Hajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat  him with the butts of their rifles.    On Tuesday, troops stopped a car driven by Abdel Azzim Qdieh, a practising  Moslem, and demanded he kiss his female passenger. Qdieh refused, the   soldiers hit him and the 18-year-old passenger kissed him to stop the   beating.    On Friday, soldiers entered the home of Zamno Abu-Ealyan, 60, blindfolded  him and his wife, put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance. As  the elderly couple danced, the soldiers slipped away. The coupled continued  dancing until their grandson came in and asked what was happening.        The army said it was checking the reports.                   ....................           ISRAELI TROOPS BAR CHRISTIANS FROM JERUSALEM    Israeli troops prevented Christian Arabs from entering Jerusalem on Thursday   to celebrate the traditional mass of the Last Supper.        Two Arab priests from the Greek Orthodox church led some 30 worshippers in  prayer at a checkpoint separating the occupied West Bank from Jerusalem after  soldiers told them only people with army-issued permits could enter.        ``Right now, our brothers are celebrating mass in the Church of the Holy  Sepulchre and we were hoping to be able to join them in prayer,'' said Father  George Makhlouf of the Ramallah Parish.        Israel sealed off the occupied lands two weeks ago after a spate of  Palestinian attacks against Jews. The closure cut off Arabs in the West Bank  and Gaza Strip from Jerusalem, their economic, spiritual and cultural centre.       Father Nicola Akel said Christians did not want to suffer the humiliation  of requesting permits to reach holy sites.        Makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory, allowing Jews free movement  to take part in recent Passover celebrations while restricting Christian  celebrations.        ``Yesterday, we saw the Jews celebrate Passover without any interruption.  But we cannot reach our holiest sites,'' he said.        An Israeli officer interrupted Makhlouf's speech, demanding to see his  identity card before ordering the crowd to leave.                      ...................

Thanks.\",\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Symbiotics: Zionism-Antisemitism   Zionism and the Holocaust -------------------------- by Haim Bresheeth  The first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history of the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without anti-semitism is impossible. Zionism agrees with the basic tenet of anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.  The history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While the industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942, its roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles in Europe. When the hopes for liberation through bourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for improving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.  The socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had to contend with opposition from a new and small, almost insignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these two offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe. While the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of Europe's workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme aimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a Jewish state.  Historically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of forces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option tree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become barred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point before that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an option was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority position until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist Federation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny minority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to represent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an interantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was the only international organisation allowed to operate during this period. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist Federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that surprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political power, power based not on representation, but from being selected as the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish problem'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in Germany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in Germany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to be considered by German Jews.  The best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934. Immediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German goods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott. It was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull out, the campaign would collapse.  This problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi party as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement that existed between the two organisations on the question of race, nation, and the nature of the 'Jewish problem', and it offered to collaborate with the new regime:  \\\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of Jews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda - such as is currently being carried out against Germany in many ways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do battle but to convince and build.\\\"  In their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott. The main public act was the signature of the \\\"Transfer Agreement\\\" with the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In essence, the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out of the country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility for Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This right was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The Zionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial organisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts - 'helping' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the boycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine, and last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After all, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the Jews come and agree with them.  After news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the Zionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with the Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ? This was not the first time that the interests of both movements were presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von Mildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS, later followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine. This he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader, Kurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a series of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new Jew' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.  This little-known episode established quite clearly the relationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new regime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a number of key instances, even after the nature of the Final Solution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of reports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book concentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the Holocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the Holocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.  In the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen's play PERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end of the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and the African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a number of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A second front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies prepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann, the master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in occupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in April 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish leadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by Kastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their relationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did this is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its three and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly different from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian Jews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class was mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed freedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in fronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were Hungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be exterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in Hungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other countries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and were unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.  Like elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the ear of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this case the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members. Without their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men, plus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and controlled a million Jews, when they did not even know their whereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions. Eichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner's committee, that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them clearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain conditions were met.  The Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary about their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape, being in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the Nazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not have been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite plausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership. Thus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their death, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to work camps.  To be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of destruction: the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised to Kastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it was a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million Jews.  There was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be located, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of Kastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews here and there, but the scale of the operation would have been miniscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.  It is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration, like say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his strongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical outcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to the Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi and Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to disrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere, did Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those Jews.\",\"GRE Test Aids for Sale ---------------------------------  Cliffs GRE Preparation Guide, (c). 1992 3 full length practive tests w/ answers and explanations Also includes test-taking strategies.

Once they are older than six you expect them to realise that doing the same thing over and over again isn't funny any more.  Basicaly Ed fails to be amusing because he is merely crass. He does not make jokes that have any political content beyond attempting to ridicule their target. Calling someone Slick Willie is not funny even if you put on a red nose while you say it, it was a good debating point used on the spur of the moment 12 months ago but now its use merely demonstrates that the user couldn't think of anything original to say.   In the UK there is a tradition of old retired Colnels who bore the dinner guests rigid with their descriptions of old campagns.

A product cipher is a block cipher that iterates several weak   operations such as substitution, transposition, modular   addition/multiplication, and linear transformation. (A ``block   cipher'' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data---8 bytes,   say---all at once, then goes on to the next block.) The notion of   product ciphers is due to Shannon [SHA49]. Examples of modern   product ciphers include LUCIFER [SOR84], DES [NBS77], SP-networks   [KAM78], LOKI [BRO90], FEAL [SHI84], PES [LAI90], Khufu and Khafre   [ME91a]. The so-called Feistel ciphers are a class of product   ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round,   and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round. LUCIFER,   DES, LOKI, and FEAL are examples of Feistel ciphers.    The following table compares the main parameters of several product    ciphers:    cipher   |   block length   |   key bits   |   number of rounds   LUCIFER          128               128                16   DES               64                56                16   LOKI              64                64                16   FEAL              64               128            2^x, x >= 5   PES               64               128                 8  * What makes a product cipher secure?    Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is   completely secure. So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the   cipher ``looks highly random''. For example, the cipher must be   nonlinear, and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends   on every bit of the plaintext and the key. Meyer [MEY78] has shown   that at least 5 rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a   dependence. In this sense a product cipher should act as a ``mixing''   function which combines the plaintext, key, and ciphertext in a   complex nonlinear fashion.    The fixed per-round substitutions of the product cipher are   referred to as S-boxes. For example, LUCIFER has 2 S-boxes, and DES   has 8 S-boxes. The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a   careful design of these S-boxes. A list of partial design criteria   for the S-boxes of DES, which apply to S-boxes in general, may be   found in Brown [BRO89] and Brickell et al. [BRI86].  * What are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers?    Let E be a product cipher that maps N-bit blocks to N-bit blocks.   Let E_K(X) be the encryption of X under key K. Then, for any fixed K,   the map sending X to E_K(X) is a permutation of the set of N-bit   blocks. Denote this permutation by P_K. The set of all N-bit   permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S_{2^N}.   The collection of all these permutations P_K, where K ranges over all   possible keys, is denoted E(S_{2^N}). If E were a random mapping from   plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect E(S_{2^N}) to generate   a large subset of S_{2^N}.    Coppersmith and Grossman [COP74] have shown that a very simple   product cipher can generate the alternating group A_{2^N} given a   sufficient number of rounds. (The alternating group is half of the   symmetric group: it consists of all ``even'' permutations, i.e., all   permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps.)   Even and Goldreich [EVE83] were able to extend these results to show   that Feistel ciphers can generate A_{2^N}, given a sufficient number   of rounds.    The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the   group-theoretic properties of a cipher. Multiple encipherment is an   extension over single encipherment if for keys K1, K2 there does   not exist a third key K3 such that    E_K2(E_K1(X)) == E_(K3)(X)                (**)    which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys   K1, K2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key K3.  If   for every K1, K2 there exists a K3 such that eq. (**) is true then   we say that E is a group.    This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was   extensively studied by Sherman, Kaliski, and Rivest [SHE88]. In their   paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a   group. In fact DES is not a group [CAM93].  * What can be proven about the security of a product cipher?    Recall from above that P_K is a permutation produced by E under   some key K. The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that P_K   appears to be a random element of S_{2^N}, the symmetric group.   Let R be an element of S_{2^N} selected randomly. We will say that P_K   and R are indistinguishable if an observer given P_K and R in some   order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial   time. That is, with time bounded resources, the observer cannot   determine which of the permutations is produced by E: the optimal   decision is no better than simply guessing.    Luby and Rackoff [LUB88] have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers   are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by   random boolean functions.  * How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size?    There are four standard \\\"modes of operation\\\" (and numerous non-standard   ones as well).  The standard modes of operation are defined in the U.S.   Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 81,   published in 1980.  See the question about \\\"ECB\\\" below for more details.    Although they are defined for the DES block cipher, the \\\"modes of   operation\\\" can be used with any block cipher.  * Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication?    One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself   that he did or did not generate a message, and to prove to himself    whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation.  But one   cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key, and    thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages   that were authenticated using that key.      See ANSI X3.106-1983 and FIPS 113 (1985) for a standard method of message   authentication using DES.  * What exactly is DES?    DES is the U.S. Government's Data Encryption Standard - a product    cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data, using a 56-bit key.      It is defined in FIPS 46-1 (1988) [which supersedes FIPS 46 (1977)].   FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS.   DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA)   defined in ANSI X3.92-1981.   * What is triple DES?    Triple DES is a product cipher which, like DES, operates on 64-bit    data blocks.  There are several forms, each of which uses the DES   cipher 3 times.  Some forms use two 56-bit keys, some use three.   The \\\"DES modes of operation\\\" may also be used with triple-DES.    Some people refer to E(K1,D(K2,E(K1,x))) as triple-DES.    This method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985   \\\"Financial Institution Key Management\\\" and is intended for use in   encrypting DES keys and IVs for \\\"Automated Key Distribution\\\".  Its   formal name is \\\"Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key   Pair\\\", but it is referenced in other standards documents as EDE.    That standard says (section 7.2.1): \\\"Key encrypting keys may be a single   DEA key or a DEA key pair.  Key pairs shoud be used where additional   security is needed (e.g., the data protected by the key(s) has a long   security life).  A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a   single key.\\\"    Others use the term \\\"triple-DES\\\" for E(K1,D(K2,E(K3,x))) or   E(K1,E(K2,E(K3,x))).    One of us (Carl Ellison) keeps advocating DES triple use in the form   E(K1, TRAN( E(K2, TRAN( E(K3, COMPRESS( x )))))), where each DES instance   has its own key and IV (for CBC mode) and TRAN has been posted on   sci.crypt.  (It is a large-block transposition program taking its key   from the data stream itself, so that it is not an encryption program on   its own part.)  * What is differential cryptanalysis?    Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be   applied to any iterated mapping (ie. any mapping which is based on   a repeated round function). The method was recently popularized by   Biham and Shamir [BIH91], but Coppersmith has remarked that the   S-boxes of DES were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago.   This method has proved effective against several product ciphers,   notably FEAL [BI91a].    Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of   ciphertexts Y, Y' whose corresponding plaintexts X, X' satisfy a   known difference D = X+X', where + is componentwise XOR. In the   basic Biham-Shamir attack, 2^{47} such plaintext pairs are required   to determine the key for DES. Substantially fewer pairs are required   if DES is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds. In these cases, the actual key   can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs.   For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many   known plaintexts.    The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling   observations on the algorithm. Most importantly, if the key   schedule was removed from DES and a 16*48 = 768-bit key was used,   the key could be recovered in less than 2^{64} steps. Thus   independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES.   Further, the S-boxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that   changing even single entries in these tables yields significant   improvement in the differential attack.    Adi Shamir is quoted to say (NYTimes Oct 13 1991), ``I would say   that, contrary to what some people believe, there is no evidence   of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened.''  * How was NSA involved in the design of DES?    According to Kinnucan [KIN78], Tuchman, a member of the group that   developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying, ``We developed the DES   algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not   dictate a single wire!'' Tuchman and Meyer (another developer of   DES) spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in   Lucifer. They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer. ``Their   basic approach was to look for strong substitution, permutation,   and key scheduling functions ... IBM has classified the notes   containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA....   `The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep   secrets it uses to make its own algorithms,' explains Tuchman.''      On the other hand, a document called ``Involvement of the NSA in   the development of DES: unclassified summary of the United States   Select Committee on Intelligence'', printed in the IEEE   Communications Magazine, p53-55, 1978, states: ``In the development   of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient;   indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and   certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their   knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.''    Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA.   The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the   algorithm itself, just the parameters, which in some sense   resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman   presented above.  * Is DES available in software?    Several people have made DES code available via ftp (see part 10 for   pathnames): Stig Ostholm [FTPSO]; BSD [FTPBK]; Eric Young [FTPEY];   Dennis Furguson [FTPDF]; Mark Riordan [FTPMR]; Phil Karn [FTPPK].   A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson [PAT87].    FIPS 46-1 says \\\"The algorithm specified in this standard is to be   implemented ... using hardware (not software) technology.  ...   Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in   compliance with this standard.\\\"  Despite this, software   implementations abound, and are used by government agencies.  * Is DES available in hardware?

These are methods for using block ciphers, such as DES, to encrypt    messages, files, and blocks of data, known as \\\"modes of operation.\\\"   Four \\\"modes of operation\\\" are defined in FIPS 81 (1980 December 2),    and also in ANSI X3.106-1983.       FIPS 81 specifies that when 7-bit ASCII data is sent in octets, the   unused most-significant bit is to be set to 1.   FIPS 81 also specifies the padding for short blocks.    The four DES modes of operation are:   Electronic Code Book  (ECB),   Cipher Block Chaining (CBC),   K-bit Cipher FeedBack (CFB), and   K-bit Output FeedBack (OFB).    These methods are explained below in a c-language-like notation.    Some symbols:    P[n] The n'th block of plaintext, input to encryption, output from    decryption.  Size of block determined by the mode.    C[n] The n'th block of ciphertext, output from encryption, input to    decryption.  Size of block determined by the mode.    E(m) The DES encryption function, performed on 64-bit block m, using    the 16-key schedule derived from some 56-bit key.    D(m) The DES decryption function, performed on 64-bit block m, using    the same key schedule as in E(m), except that the 16 keys    in the schedule are used in the opposite order as in E(m).    IV A 64-bit \\\"initialization vector\\\", a secret value which, along with    the key, is shared by both encryptor and decryptor.    I[n] The n'th value of a 64-bit variable, used in some modes.   R[n] The n'th value of a 64-bit variable, used in some modes.    LSB(m,k) The k least significant (right-most) bits of m.    e.g.  m & ((1 << k) - 1)    MSB(m,k) The k most significant (left-most) bits of m.    e.g.  (m >> (64-k)) & ((1 << k) - 1)    = ^ << >> &  operators as defined in the c langage.

Since I[n] is   independent of P and C, the E() function can be performed in advance of   the receipt of the plain/cipher text with which it is to be used.

On another news group earlier this year, someone posted that the King James Bible was the divinely inspired version of the Bible in English and was, therefore, inerrant; all other English translations were from Satan, trying to deceive the body of Christ.  A few years ago, the pastor of a church I was attending showed me a poster advertising the availability of a certain man to address congregations. Very prominantly on the poster was the fact that the man used only the KJV.

NAME: COMP.DATABASES.ACCESS  MODERATION: UNMODERATED. At this time, no need for a moderator has been assertained. Future evaluation will determine if one is needed.  PURPOSE:  Access is a new RDBMS for the Windows Operating System. It includes WYSIWYG design tools for easy creation of tables, reports, forms and queries and a database programming language called Access Basic. THe purpose of the group will be to provide help to people who use Access's  WYSIWYG design tools to create simple databases as well as to people who use  Access Basic to create complex databases.  RATIONALE: Eventhough Access is a new RDBMS, it is very popular because of its Graphical Development enviroment and its initial low price. Been a version 1.0 product means that all Access users are Novices. For that reason a newsgroup is needed where Access users can discuss  their experiences with the product and answer each other's questions.\",\"A friend of mine is going in later this week for tests to see if has emphysema.

Any truth to these?      Brad\",\" Amusing, isn't it?  Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is a *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.  Consider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom of the 13th.  Who won the game?  -Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs. -Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent  defensive plays behind him to do so. -Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and  got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of  the inning.  Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for the win.  How about the offense? -Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either  one, the Sox would have lost in nine. -Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single. -Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first  to third when... -Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning. -Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of  a help, but it was something. -Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the  way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)  Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were credited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit that set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as much as Richardson?  Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than runs.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the game-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with only one out!  Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  You can argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the clutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.  At least OBP and SLG don't *claim* to try to tell you that.

Starting a alt.encrypted newsgroup rather than just maintaining mailing lists is better for several reasons.  First, it would be easier to archive for people who might join a group \\\"late\\\" and who might like to easily read earlier posts; second, traffic analysis to know exactly to whom an affinity message is directed would be foiled; three, a newsgroup is much more public and would serve to publicize available privacy measures on the internet.

Today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique I'd never seen before.  He took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil. The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray, made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.  In the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar quantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two teabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.  On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with two chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.  Later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises and concerns me are:  1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?  2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color     (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring     agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected     it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,     caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being     used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?  3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated     as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract     from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever     happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea     could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do     so.  WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens), I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips, getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process, then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.  My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight stuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff, just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?  I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this duck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the floor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.  And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually has some standing, don't know about the others.\",\"Hi,  I'm in the market for an internal color video adaptor for my PB 145.

It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you very much).   well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell me the order of the wires.   there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.   if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.   btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of little boxes). Oh, well . . .   one more thing: in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on the newer models are different from the connection used on the plus--- you're right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plus and connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. in other words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible. it's merely a matter of finding out the correct order.   omt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solution so others can, too. thanx for the input.\",\"}     A note on the lighter side, I've noticed most gun-banners (some of my }   friends included) are the one who make comments that indicate they are  }   more likely to resort to violent.

Whether it is photos or just data or whatever.  Here is a simplified way of looking at it: The first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks.  The second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still exists, because you cannot change, only add.  So if you put that in a 'normal' drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all data.  Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last directory written to the disc, older systems look only for 'the' directory, not taking multiple directories into account.\",\"Dear Rob,   Sometimes I do come across condesending, and I am sorry I come across that way at times.  Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll try to get better.  Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far, only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.  Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K.  vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.   I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with his set of excuses.    I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.  From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I  see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away from the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see the dialog:   Me:  \\\"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\\\"   BK:  \\\"There is no truck.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around at look.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at      the oncoming truck.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around or you will run over.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\\\"  Me:  \\\"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing       to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\\\"       I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.  BK:  \\\"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.       Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\\\"       And by the way, I really have an open mind.\\\"   So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?     I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have. I can now see the truck behind Brian.  My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment, Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his head will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. \",\"In a Philadelphia Inquirer a few days ago, it was reported that there were two (2) plans for a new Phillies stadium:  the already-mentioned 30th Street Station proposal, and a location near Broad Street and Race Street, I think.  I can't remember the exact details, but the stadium would be build practically downtown.  There is a small lot that could be used, according to the paper.  The 30th street plan has run into some trouble, because Amtrak does not want to reroute some of its lines in order to accomodate the stadium.

I am not saying that I totally agree with his   interpretation, but it is certainly believable and good food for thought.  He   interprets the Babylon of Revelation 17-18 as being none other than the good   old U. S. of A.  That's right, America.  He supports his claim in several ways.    The Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce, and the   WHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell.  The American dollar, despite the Japanese   success of the 20th century, is STILL the most sought after currency in the   world.  If the U.S. were destroyed, wouldn't the whole world mourn?  The bible   also talks about Babylon being a home of harlots, sin, and adultery (I am   paraphrasing, of course).  Babylon's sin affected, or should I say, infected,   the whole world.  It doesn't take much looking to see that the U.S. is in a   state of moral decay.  Hasn't the American culture and Hollywood spread the \\\"do   it if it feels good\\\" mentality all over the world.  I think, though, that what   Mr. Wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that Revelation calls   Babylon \\\"Babylon the Great\\\" and portrays it as the most powerful nation on   earth.  No matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country, I   don't think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the U.S. is STILL the   most powerful nation on earth.

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) rocket ship.          The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in mid-June.          Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for SSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60 million for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a follow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies.          SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent changes in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO less of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as a step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.          SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies, said Col.  Simon \\\"Pete\\\" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program. \\\"I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I have available to spend,\\\" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell Douglas Astronautics headquarters.          While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital objective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the \\\"better, faster, cheaper\\\" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that \\\"leapfrog\\\" ahead of evolutionary technology developments.          Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a \\\"build a little, test a little\\\" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said the program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months -- showed how today's engineers could move beyond the \\\"miracles of our parents' time.\\\"          \\\"The key is management,\\\" Worden said. \\\"SDIO had a very light hand on this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.\\\"          Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be crucial. \\\"It's essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially.\\\"          SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee. \\\"This is the direction we're going to have to go,\\\" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee's Democratic chairman. \\\"Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't sustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has.\\\"          Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further. Joking that \\\"a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,\\\" Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency.          Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell Douglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. \\\"Let's not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!\\\"           Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.          McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its C-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment. \\\"On very large ventures, companies put in seed money,\\\" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas' senior vice president for space systems. \\\"You need strong government investments.\\\"          While the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas Aircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).          Flight tests this summer at White Sands will \\\"expand the envelope\\\" of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle take-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to 5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000 feet.          Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final tests will include a \\\"pitch-over\\\" manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.          The flight test series will be supervised by Charles \\\"Pete\\\" Conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing. Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles aircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated check-out and access panels for easy maintainance.          If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will become a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the Pratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of thrust          Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on throttling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid turnaround.          Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ tri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union. The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.\",\" Hence we are \\\"all\\\" above the Law where \\\"all\\\" in this case refers to Christians.

If it's a choice between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is only one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first.  Second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent.  Third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social beasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are two types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which dominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible. But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh rapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!  Now, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a game, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one; when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of interception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to react to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of.  With a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures may be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important -- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the road, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up newspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The larger the dog, the greater your anger.  Dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he are not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.  Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped punishment.\",\" [DG] THE U.S. HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM: A COSTLY AND DANGEROUS MISTAKE [DG] by Theodore J.

When I am running Windows, and I have overlapping windows (say an application overlapping the program manager window), and I close the active application, window erasure is very slow.  The part of the window that is not overlapping is erased first, very slowly.  This also happens when I iconify an application.  The HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card, but it does not have an accelerator chip on it.  I am running at 800x600x32k.  Is this slow speed simply to be expected without an accelerator chip, or is there something else that is bottlenecking the system that I am unaware of?

The point that Darren raises is a very Lutheran viewpoint.   While reason is a gift from God, it is also infected by sin. Yet we do not reject reason entirely--and neither, I think,  does Darren.  We need reason, as Darren himself has pointed out, to comprehend God's revelation of himself in the Bible. But reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe the Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For \\\"the sinful mind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to God's law, *nor can it do so*\\\"  (Romans 8:7).  Luther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation (\\\"Sola Scriptura\\\"), but accepted the necessity of the use of reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation. Yet Luther also said, regarding baptism, \\\"But mad reason rushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do, regards it as worthless.\\\" (Large Catechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters more complicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many  people would describe as an `absolutist'.  I've seen him  described as a `take no prisoners' theologian.  We might conclude, given these observations, that Luther was inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some have come to that conclusion.  But it might be useful to recall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter felt compelled to defend himself and the apostles against a charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christians ought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others)  as mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, who examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true (Acts 17:11).  The basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and many others preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the Holy Spirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that guides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach the message that \\\"I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead\\\" but rather \\\"I know that my redeemer lives!\\\"  (Job 19:25).  The Christian does not side with Pilate in saying \\\"What is truth?\\\" but rather follows Christ, who said, \\\"In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone on the side of truth listens to me\\\" (John 18:37).  We can know the truth because God has promised us that we can know the truth.  Jesus said, \\\"If you hold to my teachings, you are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free\\\" (John 8:31,32).  The Proverbs urge us \\\"Buy the truth, and do not sell it.\\\" (Pr 23:23). The Psalmist prayed \\\"Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth\\\" (Ps 119:43).  Evidently he believed that the word of truth was in fact `in his mouth'.    Yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth is motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present the truth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the  Spirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready to be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Luther did, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humbly trust in God's promise of truth, just as we trust in his promise of forgiveness.  REXLEX> It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be  REXLEX> absolute about a thing.  Darren> But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, Darren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.  I agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings of Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such reasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would draw the line of distinction more `reasonably'  :-)  and less `academically' than you would.  Darren> For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations Darren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, Darren> and that Jesus said, exactly, \\\"This is my body.\\\"  Darren> We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and Darren> absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.  Darren> At the moment he stops speaking, and people start Darren> interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean Darren> that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he Darren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- Darren> substantiation?  He didn't say.   Darren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement about the Lord's supper.  The Lutheran approach is to say that if Jesus said, \\\"This is my body,\\\" then that is what we should believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply because they are not taught in Scripture.  Recall that Jesus' words do not stand alone on this subject.  We also have Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on to us, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, \\\"For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.\\\"  By these words we should believe that the bread that we eat in the Lord's Supper really is bread (as well as the Lord's body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove* that tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say that Paul spoke metaphorically of the Lord's body as bread, simply because that is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought is found nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primary reason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can prove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.  [side remark] I've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is con-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have told me this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that this is used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels to compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord's Supper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching \\\"real presence\\\" because that was the traditional teaching of  the church. [end side remark]  Darren> When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning Darren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we Darren> are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe Darren> that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when Darren> the person you are talking to believes that you are either too Darren> foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying Darren> to cover them up.  This is precisely why Christians should not rely on rationalizations in their witnessing.  It is far better to take the approach, \\\"I'd like to show you what Scripture says.  You decide for  yourself whether to believe it or not.\\\"  Darren> `REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Darren> Silent_, by Francis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of Darren> it, but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Darren> Evangelical Christians.  Somebody else might like it, though, Darren> so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.  Darren> If someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On Darren> Certainty_, by Ludwig Wittgenstein.  As long as we're trading references, I'd like to suggest Dr. Siegbert Becker's paperback, \\\"The Foolishness of God: The place of reason in Lutheran theology,\\\" published by Northwestern Publishing House.

I agree completely. One thing I can't stand about the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is down!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around, etc.  But for most work, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than using the mouse.

The book says that Muhammad was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a  modern day Mad Mahdi) or he was actually who he said he was. Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.  Who would  die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People  gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing  how his son-in-law made the sun stand still.  Call me a fool, but I believe  he did make the sun stand still.   Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn  to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example  anyone who is drawn to the Mad Mahdi is obviously a fool, logical people see  this right away.

A much more likely explanation is the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because the sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the historical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation images of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of the clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course not.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the anti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or because it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun to represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented, but I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now. -- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com) \",\"   > [A very nice article on the DSS, which I thought answered    >  David Cruz-Uribe's original queries quite well]     Here are some books I have read recently that helped me not only    prepare for a 5 week series I taught in Sunday School, but greatly    increased my knowledge of the Qumran scrolls.
