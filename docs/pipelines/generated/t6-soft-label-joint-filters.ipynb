Thanks!\",\"Hello networld,  I'm looking for an X mailreader. Is there a Xelm?  Andreas  \",\"  Actually I don't think there is any conflict if we really understand what these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the  meaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will come to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere  belief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your  belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this  is what James means when he says that \\\"faith without works is dead\\\"  and, \\\"I will show you my faith by my works.\\\"  Remember James was  writing to \\\"the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.\\\"  This  probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much  later and wouldn't understand the meaning of the original Greek. (Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he intended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the people of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of the Greek.  Another key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul's statements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul contrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the gospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great burden of Paul's life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go convert a bunch of people, then the \\\"Judizers\\\" would come along and try to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf Acts chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being saved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood of Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation for today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think \\\"faithfulness\\\" today has a meaning closer to what the original writers intended.   I think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is that God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not \\\"keep kosher\\\" to a kosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters of following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.   In the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and  be lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are  worse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in the parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in the one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that the price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.  [I agree with you in general, including the fact that \\\"pistis\\\" has some of the force of \\\"faithful\\\".  However if you take that too far, you can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have intended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say that we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we are saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that's not what you meant.  I have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that completely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I'd call a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and commitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic change.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show the new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any Christian there had better be the basic change in orientation that Jesus calls being born again.\",\"Everyone... Read this.

Sound Manager used by the book is *useless*. Disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed is out of the question for games with smooth animation. (It's too slow.)  The Sound Driver is so much snappier than Sound Manager. Unfortunately, System 7 supports it poorly, making programs crash occasionally.   Well, I want my code to work on old systems too. I don't know about sys 7.1, but at least on 6.0.7, there are bugs in the Sound Manager that causes channels to hang (with no error message). This happends when I keep a channel open for long periods - necessary for performance - and play many sounds, stopping sounds halfway. Callbacks seems not to be reliable. Then only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to inspect private variables in the channel (QHead, I think it was), and the only way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an *undocumented* flag and modify it.  Am I happy with this? Nope. I consider writing to SoundBase simply to get rid of the bugs.  Any better suggestions?

If the Lebanese army was able to maintain the peace, then Israel would not have to be there.  Until it is, Israel prefers that its soldiers die rather than its children.     Israel should withdraw from Lebanon when a peace treaty is signed.  Not a day before.  Withdraw because of casualties would tell the Lebanese people that all they need to do to push Israel around is kill a few soldiers.  Its not gonna happen.     Why should Israel not demand this while holding the buffer zone?  It seems to me that the better bargaining position is while holding your neighbors land.  If Lebanon were willing to agree to those conditions, Israel would quite probably have left already. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that the Lebanese can disarm the Hizbolah, and maintain the peace.

Jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or police monitors, are essentially making the claim that there is no other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor.   The results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed. The federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts have sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdiction and sometimes they have not.  A lot of state courts do not have enough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides avoiding law enforcement action for speeding.  When you buy a radar detector, amongst the guarrantees, instructions,  explanations, and other detritus, is an invitation to join an association dedicated to preserving your right to use a radar detector. (I promise I am not making this up!)  I do not think radar detector manufacturers would be making any  headway at all in courtrooms if police departments enforced speed  laws with a strict eye to public safety and a blind eye to the fund raiser aspect of tickets.  \",\"I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of mite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a lot of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years (since we moved to N.C.).  Here are some observations gained from painful experience:    1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.      Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more      sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.    2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear      that these things will itch for months.    3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of      it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,      since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could      find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special      collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is      required to get it.    4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old      folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall      reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers      burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I      think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some      sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.    5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.      A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally      applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is      another preparation called \\\"Chig Away\\\" that is a combination of      sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was      prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In      the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get      up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we      live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They      apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur      as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)    6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget      the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment      that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone      creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine      (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.      Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this      counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think      it gains nothing).    7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved      by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery      as well.  Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money.\",\"  I didnot know that \\\"Master of wisdom\\\" can be \\\"name clling\\\" too, unless you consider yourself deserve-less !

Clearly, occupation is an undeclared war; during war, attacks against military targets are fully legitimate.   Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing Palestinean human rights.

The training course will discuss the applications of satellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy and the environment.  The training course, organised for the benefit of francophone African experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space Agency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for coordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing satellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing, selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western and central Africa, and three regional African centres, will attend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote sensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1 data.  The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991 with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year 2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the potential of experts using the practical applications of radar remote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy and the environment, with particular emphasis on applications to geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near- coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.  The education and practical training programme was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The facilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and information documents for the training course, will be provided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will include high-level experts from other European and African organisations active in remote sensing applications.

From LA Times, Friday, April 9, 1993.  P. A1.    EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE    By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer    SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the  Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a  nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than  950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as  12,000 people.    Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco  authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how  operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and  infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,  right-wing and what they called \\\"pinko\\\" organizations.    Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known  organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting  anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking  any laws.    Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to  gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los  Angeles and San Francisco.    Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political  spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan  Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish  Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of  directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San  Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.    People who were subjects of the spy operation included former  Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.  LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who  is based in South Africa.    Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was  confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement  agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and  organizations was sold separately to the South African government.    In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from  police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony  counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West  Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify  the search warrant.    The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than  25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.  Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in  San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation  Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax  attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not  be reached for comment, his office said.    Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a  panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial  recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a  former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.    The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied  repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.  League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an  employee and have said they simply traded information with police  departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.    But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches,  San Francisco police alleged that \\\"ADL employees were apparently less  than truthful\\\" in providing information during an earlier search  conducted without a warrant.    David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said  the organization has not violated the law.  \\\"There is nothing  nefarious about how we operate or what we have done,\\\" he said.  \\\"Our  record speaks for itself.\\\"    The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret  fund used to pay for \\\"fact-finding operations.\\\"  Lehrer, according to  the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.  Patterson.    An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to  a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending  them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.    Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for  nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with  San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many  sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as  \\\"Skins\\\" and \\\"Pinkos,\\\" but that did not necessarily mean that they were  under surveillance.    \\\"I might never see or call up on 99% of them again,\\\" Bullock said.  \\\"And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a  threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under,  say, 'Pinko.'\\\"    In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police  Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he  was questioned by the FBI in the case.    A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records  and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,  vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license  photographs.    Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and  Bullock also provided information to the South African government,  receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.    The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the  South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss  nature of the spy operation.    The file notes that Kraft's articles \\\"appear frequently in The Times  and are well researched and written,\\\" but little else about the file  is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another  Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong  Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal  information.    Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how  Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from  skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash  of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his  own paid informants under code names such as \\\"Scott\\\" and \\\"Scumbag.\\\"    He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,  exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,  including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.    It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying  on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African  government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an  agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the  probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The  Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather  information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,  Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and  investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league  offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of  San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax  Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to  cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los  Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that  some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may  have come from Los Angeles police officers.        From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.    ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION    By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.    SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a  civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities  who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential  police information on citizens and groups.    But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation  League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many  felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax  violations and conspiracy.    Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful  about its spying operations, which collected information on more than  12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political  spectrum.    Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show  that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept  files on political figures.    Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down  its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when  deciding what charges to file.    In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.  Foxman described the ADL as \\\"a Jewish defense agency which has fought  to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80  years.\\\"    Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on  extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing  information to police, journalists, academics, government officials  and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain  information illegally, he said.    \\\"Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and  physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or  identity of any source of information,\\\" Foxman said.    The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its  longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than \\\"a private  individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'\\\"    Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements  showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through  Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.    \\\"Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be  distanced from ADL,\\\" Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.  Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.    Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate  with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn  over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's  offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.    A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,  produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial  transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it  will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.    \\\"The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,\\\"  the district attorney said.\",\"  I have discussed this with my girlfriend often.

CRITZ, III\\\" <71611.365@CompuServe.COM> Subject: EnviroLeague  \\\"Birth Announcement\\\" on March 7, 1993, from EARTH Forum, CompuServe                        Information Service ===================================================================                        FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT                      -------------------                                        (SM)                         EnviroLeague   A new youth movement,\\\"EnviroLeague,\\\" was recently born, according to its founder, Boyd R. Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois. EnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in matters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our environment.   Incorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and initial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to Critz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and Objectives:                              MISSION      It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members    to foster and implement the improved education of young    people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards    of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition    than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,    moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue    the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall    seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the    separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,    improvement, and responsible use of the environment in    which we must all live.                            OBJECTIVES      In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary    objectives shall be:        (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many             environmentally concerned organizations as             possible, said Movement having as its primary             focus the education and participatory             involvement of young people in appropriate areas             of environmental concern;        (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and             their branches a full complement of program             materials for their use, including suitable             uniforms, insignia and other badges, written             ideas, syllabi and information, literature and             other items as shall seem appropriate and             desirable;        (3)  To serve as a \\\"clearing house\\\" for the exchange             of program ideas, materials and information             among said organizations;  and        (4)  To assist environmentally concerned             organizations to recruit and train the necessary             adult leadership for their youth programs.   EnviroLeague will operate through three \\\"Program Divisions\\\" serving youth in the elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be through formation of \\\"EnviroLeague Teams,\\\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by environmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a charter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.   EnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders of each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to membership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper conduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain additional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such organizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as possible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to youth membership.   EnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to contribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its Teams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any local administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be involved in similar functions at the national level.   Program materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \\\"draft\\\" portions of the Mentor's Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the EARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes place.   CompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague's founder chose this electronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation. This announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH Forums.   The electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe's Earth Forum - GO EARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \\\"EnviroLeague.\\\" ============================================================================   Subsequently, EnviroLeague's Initial Governance Council has held its first meeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian (equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home (309) 675-4483 in case of real need.  Also, mail can be addressed to:        EnviroLeague        P.O.

Also, that some video cards on the ISA bus look for a memory aperture to map their memory to.  So that if I wanted to put 16MB of memory on my PC, my video card wouldn't have anywhere to map it's memory to.  Can someone explain this in more detail.  Is there a way around this limit.  If you email me a response, I will summarize.  -Bo begolej@csgrad.cs.vt.edu\",\"Fellow netters,  I just wanted to let you know that there are a few honest and good people out there (even outside of Iowa).  I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting space, but I thought you might want some relief from the \\\"So-and-so is a thief\\\" posts.  Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be nice to hear some good news once in a while.  After seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a request for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50 in his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That sounded more than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day.  Imagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a message from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed the money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and assured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He sent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a transfer of license.  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him to fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times to get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for my signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the deal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world's best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good ones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat you may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my software from him.  Bravo, Mr. Miller!\",\" Huh?  If I buy a 128M optical, I might lose my friends?  Why - do they smell bad?  :-)    On a serious note, I have heard the tales about SyQuest failures.  But I am curious about Jon's comments on cartridge wear for the the Bernoullis. Can someone elaborate?  Is there a general consensus that the 128M opticals are the most reliable?  I am mostly concerned about media failures, as opposed to drive mechanism failures.\",\"     Actually all the liberals I've seen have deplored the burning of  children. I would far preferred that the Davidians had not set the  fire that burned themselves and their children to death, but I don't  believe that the responsibility for the fire (or the almost complete  absense of attempts to escape the blaze) can be placed at the door of  the Federal authorities.       Not so. My wife got me a convenient plastic \\\"drip pan\\\" for Christmas...       Yeah, those Nazis. You know how we liberals just love those Nazis.       Yeah, as information trickles in... funny how that works... \",\" I always thought that the Pope was a bear.  You know, because of that little saying:  Does a bear shit in the woods?

First of all, when I'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a ``breakthrough in factoring'', what I really mean is a breakthrough in the cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are not proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to repeat this every time.  I also have to admit that I don't really know if the ``non-group'' property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I have thought about it a little while, but I can't find a way that a cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That, of course, means nothing at all.  Then I wrote,   What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the cryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA for a long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people would simply use longer moduli.  Both users and cryptanalysts benefit from better technology in the same way.  Hope this keeps the flames away...  Have fun. \",\"  DUDE!  Are you nuts?  WFAN is second to none.

The call to XClearArea does not repaint the window background, but still generates exposure events for visible parts of the window.  In order to let my application know that these expose events must be handled incrementally (something is already displayed on the screen and may need to be erased), I encapsulate the 3 operations with 2 self addressed client messages, which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server.

The first part of the plan is to begin a  comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues  such as export controls which have effectively denied most people  easy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues  posed by new technology.         However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has  already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before  any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the  Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone  equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed  by the National Security Agency. The so-called \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is an  80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into  chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow  agents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over  law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The  encryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be  available to any manufacturer for incorporation into their  communications products.         This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .         First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution  before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper chip may  not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may  have better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the  government as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets  based on open standards.         Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested.  Yet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm  classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public  and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a  standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.           Third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed  system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and  law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored  publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the  safety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive  individual's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal  inquiries?           In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the  importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into  digital privacy and security.  However, the \\\"Clipper chip\\\" solution  ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before  the discussion even begins.  DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:  ESCROW  The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of  whom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid  warrant, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts  over to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General  will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the  Administration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal  agency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental  organization.  But, there is no agreement on the identity of the agents  yet.  Key registration would be done by the manufacturer of the  communications device.  A key is tied to the device, not to the person  using it.  CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS  The Administration claims that there are no back door means by  which the government or others could break the code without  securing keys from the escrow agents and that the President will  be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order  to prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for  an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security  arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results  of the investigation would then be made public.  GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER  In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government  believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big  customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service,  VP Al Gore, and maybe even the President.   FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:  Jerry Berman, Executive Director Daniel J. Weitzner, Senior Staff Counsel     \",\"I'm looking for a program that will let me use a windows common dialog box to select a file to use when running a DOS app.   Basically, I have several DOS apps that I use now and then with different files.  They all accept a file as a command line  parameter, but the only way (at least that I know of) to do this easily when running them from windows is to set up the PIF file so that it prompts me for additional parameters (at which point I type  in the file name).    Problems are:   1) Sometimes I can't remember where the file is exactly located and it would be nice to browse my directories for it without having to use the file manager.       and 2) I'm lazy and hate to type long pathnames for files burried  several directory levels deep.   If anyone can point me to such a program or let me know of some other way to handle this, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks,  Tim --   The Net isn't organized enough to be considered an anarchy\",\"  If a landlord sells an apartment building \\\"vacant\\\" to another landlord and fails to notify his tenants, they just might find themselves out on the street all of a sudden.  The seller may be a scoundrel and a crook but this doesn't make the buyer a \\\"thief\\\", as Israelis are so often called here on tpm.   The Arabs that lived along the coast in Western Palestine, later to be called Israel, were shafted by their brother Arabs just as they've been shafted for decades since then by their Arab bretheren.  Somehow, though, the Arab call has continued to blame Israel, not only for the Syrian landowner sell-out in Western Palestine (Israel) but even for the occupation of Eastern Palestine (Jordan) by the Hashemites.  This is just more of refusing to take blame for one's own actions.   If your job was eliminated in a corporate takeover, you could probably go to court, too.  You'd probably lose, though. \",\"Time to clear out some miscellaneous lenses, cameras and photo stuff that's not being used.  Some are gems, some are mundane.     Minolta AF 50/1.7 lens for Maxxum cameras.  New lens, but I guess it'd be best to call it a \\\"demo\\\" since I did not get the literature, box or warranty cards.  $30.   Vivitar 2X converter for Nikon F or AI lenses.  Pretty cute \\\"flip back\\\" tang so it will work with all manual focus Nikon lenses - and bodies. It will even couple (and double) a non-AI lens to an AI body.  $15.   Pentax 50/1.4 screwmount lens.  Well actually it's a Super-Takumar which is what they all were back then.  Very mint condition.  $25. Nice hard case for this lens $5 more..   Alpex 135/2.8 lens.  Beautifully made, all metal construction with fine optics.  Minolta mount.  $25.  Another hard case that fits this with strap can be added..call it $7 more.   Vivitar 283 flash.  The one that made Vivitar famous (until the 285 eclipsed it).  Tilt head, removable sensor, variable auto exposure. $30.   Universal \\\"Roamer 63\\\" folding old \\\"bellows\\\" camera with leather case. Uses 120 or 620 film, 100mm F6.3 lens.  Kinda cool articulated shutter release.  Decent shape.  $20.   Weston 540 lightmeter.  Nothin super fancy, but it works well, and is a good cross check to built in meters.  $7 with case and strap.   And finally..the \\\"gems\\\"   Pentax Auto 110 camera with 24mm F2.8 lens.  This is the little (and I do mean TINY) SLR that Pentax made.  Has interchangeable lenses, but try and find the 20-40 zoom, true through the lens viewing with split image focus, and completely auto exposure.  $70.   Olympus 35RC rangefinder camera.  A really cute little camera with 42mm lens (F2.8) with built in manual or auto exposure, self timer etc.  I think this was the predecessor to the XA - and it's nearly all metal. I won't mind holding onto this one if it doesn't sell.  $60.   Olympus OM-1 with flash shoe, leatherette case, 50/1.4 Zuiko lens, and Tokina SD (Super Dispersion) 70-210 lens.  These are all in very nice to mint condition, except for one little ding on the OM body near the film advance lever.  Lenses are perfect, and the Tokina is a very compact, and sharp lens.  $225 for the set.     That'll do to clean out some of the stuff.  Feel free to offer on this stuff, although the cheaper stuff is priced to cover my hassle in shipping it..

Unless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys from men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations in which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex (due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least some sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the children from abuse by members of the *same* sex.  If we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest that if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a practical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations in which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse them. By working together \\\"with good will on both sides\\\", we may be able to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.  Mr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for personal attacks on Mr. Cramer. While Mr. Walz hasn't (by a *long* stretch) been the only one to flame Mr. Cramer, it is no less childish and it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the future. \",\"... ...\",\" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  As a muslim (spelled sometimes as Moslem) I must say that Muslims strong ly believe in Jesus.

The xpert mailing list is the general, public mailing list on X maintained by the X Consortium. The mailings are gatewayed, so xpert is almost  identical to the comp.windows.x Usenet newsgroup.    *** If you get comp.windows.x, you don't need to  ***  *** be added to the xpert mailing list.   ***   Otherwise, you can join the list to receive X information  electronically. It is best to find a local distribution; perhaps someone within your company is already receiving the mailing. As a last resort, send mail to  xpert-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with a valid return electronic address.    The xannounce mailing list carries major X announcements, such as new releases (including public patches from MIT), public reviews, adoption of  standards by the MIT X Consortium, and conference announcements.  It does NOT  carry advertisements, source code, patches, or questions.  If you already  receive the Usenet news group comp.windows.x.announce or the xpert mailing  list, you don't need to be added to the xannounce mailing list.  Otherwise, to  subscribe, send a request to xannounce-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu. Note: Only  redistribution addresses will be accepted for this list -- i.e. no personal  addresses. If you wish to receive xannounce yourself, please contact your mail  administrator to set up a local redistribution list and to put you on it.    comp.windows.x.apps is not gatewayed to a mailing list.   In addition, the X Consortium sponsors these public lists:   bug-clx         CLX bug reports and discussions   x-ada           X and ada   x11-3d          people interested in X and 3d graphics   ximage          people interested in image processing and X   xvideo          discussion of video extensions for X  To subscribe to one of these lists, assuming no-one in your  organization already receives it, send mail to <list>-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with the Subject line including the name of the LIST in caps and the request \\\"addition request\\\".  In the body of the message be sure to give an address for  your local distribution which is accessible from MIT (eddie.mit.edu).

O'Reilly and Associates sponsors a mailing list for the use of X user  group organizers; subscribe by sending to listserv@ora.com the message  \\\"subscribe xgroups your@internet.address\\\".   Local area X user's groups are listed in Issue 4 of O'Reilly's X  Resource journal; a list may also be available from xug@ics.com.   The French X User Group is called AFUX and is based in Sophia Antipolis by CERICS. Information can be obtained from Miss Vasseur or Miss Forest; BP  148; 157, rue Albert Einstein; 06561 Valbonne Cedex; Phone: +33 93 95 45 00 /  45 01; Fax: +33 93 95 48 57.  [10/90]   The European X User Group was formed in 1989 to represent X users in  Europe.  It holds technical conferences at regular intervals. The EXUG also  publishes a regular newsletter which is distributed free of charge to members.  The EXUG also runs a email mailing list for members which is frequently used to address issues of European interest in X. The EXUG can be contacted at P.Whitehead@cc.ic.ac.uk, +44 (071) 225 8754, fax +44 (071) 823 9497.   GXUGiV is the German X User's Group in Vorbereitung (\\\"in preparation\\\") being formed for X programmers and users; it is associated with the EXUG. All interested should contact Olaf Heimburger (+49 30 7 79 54 64; and at mcvax!unido!tub!olaf).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   6)  What related FAQs are available?   Liam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posts a FAQ on Open Look to  comp.windows.open-look.    Jan Newmarch (jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) posts a FAQ on Motif to  comp.windows.x.motif.  Peter Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) posts a FAQ for comp.windows.x.intrinsics; it is on export in contrib/FAQ-Xt.  Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca) posts to comp.windows.x a FAQ on  maximizing the performance of X.  Steve Kotsopoulos (steve@ecf.toronto.edu) posts to comp.windows.x a FAQ about using X on Intel-based Unix systems.  The FAQ in alt.binaries.pictures contains information on viewing images with X and on massaging image formats.  The FAQ in comp.mail.mh (gatewayed to MH-users@ics.uci.edu) includes a  section on xmh.  The FAQ in comp.lang.lisp contains information on several interface tools and toolkits.  There exists a PEX/PHiGS FAQ.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   7)  How do I ask a net-question so as to maximize helpful responses?   When asking for help on the net or X mailing lists, be sure to include  all information about your setup and what you are doing.  The more specific you are, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without all the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are able to respond at all.   Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it  from. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system, give details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S  version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to  mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.   Then tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what you expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the  exact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote  doesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary  (just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available?   The trade magazines (Unix World, Unix Review, Computer Language, etc.) are publishing more articles on X.  Two X-specific publications include:   - O'Reilly and Associates publishes \\\"The X Resource: A Practical  Journal of the X Window System\\\" (103 Morris St. #A, Sebastapol, CA 95472).   Editorial information: Adrian Nye, adrian@ora.com.   - The X Journal is started bi-monthly publication September 1991 on a  variety of X topics. Subscription information: The X Journal, Subscriber  Services, Dept XXX, P.O. Box 3000, Denville, NJ 07834, USA. Editorial  information: editors%topgun@uunet.uu.net.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   9)  What are these common abbreviations/acronyms?   Xt: The X Toolkit Intrinsics is a library layered on Xlib which  provides the functionality from which the widget sets are built. An \\\"Xt-based\\\"  program is an application which uses one of those widget sets and which uses  Intrinsics mechanisms to manipulate the widgets.  Xmu: The Xmu library is a collection of Miscellaneous Utility functions useful in building various applications and widgets.  Xaw: The Athena Widget Set is the MIT-implemented sample widget set distributed with X11 source.  Xm: The OSF/Motif widget set from the Open Software Foundation; binary kits are available from many hardware vendors.  Xhp (Xw): The Hewlett-Packard Widget Set was originally based on R2++,  but several sets of patches exist which bring it up to R3, as it is distributed on the X11R4 tapes. Supplemental patches are available to use it with R4/R5.  CLX: The Common Lisp X Interface is a Common Lisp equivalent to Xlib.  XDMCP: The X Display Manager Protocol provides a uniform mechanism for  a display such as an X terminal to request login service from a remote host.  XLFD: The X Logical Font Description Conventions describes a standard logical font description and conventions to be used by clients so that they can query and access those resources.  RTFM: Common expert-speak meaning \\\"please locate and consult the  relevant documentation -- Read the Forgotten Manual\\\".  UTSL: A common expression meaning \\\"take advantage of the fact that you  aren't limited by a binary license -- Use The Source, Luke\\\".  API: Application-Programmer Interface. The function calls, etc., in a programming library.  BDF: Bitmap Distribution Format; a human-readable format for uncompiled X fonts.  GUI: graphical user interface.  UIL: the User Interface Language, part of OSF/Motif which lets  programmers specify a widget hierarchy in a simple \\\"outline\\\" form  WCL: the Widget Creation Language, a package which extends the  understanding of the Xt resource format such that a widget hierarchy and  actions on the widgets can be specified through the resources file  GIL: the file format put out by Sun's OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0  UIMS: User Interface Management System  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  10)  What is the ICCCM? (How do I write X-friendly applications?)   The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the  official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It  describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with  other clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need  to read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the  selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window  manager.  Get it either:  - as part of the R4 distribution from MIT  - in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys \\\"X Window System\\\" book  - as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, \\\"X Protocol Reference Manual.\\\" A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.  The version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to  the efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the  presentation.  [from David Rosenthal, 10/90]   - the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's \\\"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5\\\". The complete document is on the R5 tapes.   Alternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in \\\"RTFM\\\" and is the most-important of the least-read X documents.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?   The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of  cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software  interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.  MIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and  administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the  Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership,  Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).  Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail,  with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape, interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.   Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with  others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification is produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium as a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public  review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.  Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or  Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.  Write to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer  Science, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.  [For complete information see the XCONSORTIUM man page from the X11R4 distribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?   OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK was developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was developed by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF  members.    OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide;  there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications. Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the  one from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce  programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's  (formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a \\\"virtual toolkit\\\" which provides objects in the style of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.   OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising  their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.  [Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?   Open Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system  that combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface  specification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including the SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and a number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).  [thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?   DECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI  toolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a  session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar,  dxpsview, etc.).  (At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.) [8/90]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  15)  What is PEX?   PEX is the \\\"PHiGS Extension to X\\\".  PHiGS stands for \\\"Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics  System\\\" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation  and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in  hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension  allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized  hardware for 3D graphics.  Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely  redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample implementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release. Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for  their workstations and X terminals.  [last modified 10/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  16)  What is \\\"low-bandwidth X\\\" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?  There are several options for using X over serial lines:  SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP packets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years, and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations. Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really  ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per  packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully  so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links).   CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the  40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do  anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help, but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed  data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).  PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than SLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial  line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for  running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable.  XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition  to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes  redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and  using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a  pseudo-X server or \\\"proxy\\\" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There  are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:    (1) You don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't   otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly   connected), and    (2) It reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that  have to cross the serial interface, and    (3) In addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering   packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for   blocks to compress.  LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a standard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using  NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information  (e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps,  etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a  Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample  implementation available in R6.  Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/ in the following files:         XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote         XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX  [information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]   There is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk at the 7th MIT X Technical Conference.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?   The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the X window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is no single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways  for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout, decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order (generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):   wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3  uwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed,  although it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.  twm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window  managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a re-parenting window manager.   awm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers  cwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system.   rtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.  dxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering  hpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm  mwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit  tekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering   olwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style Guide functionality  olwm (AT&T): ditto  gwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in Lisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on avahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]  m_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape  pswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release  swm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple GUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes from the resources file  twm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked twm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape  vtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a single-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available on archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available  from export. [3/92]  tvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is available on archive servers  olvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is  available on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.  mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version is floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a  source license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].  NCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look   XDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals   ctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5  twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export. Version 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.  vuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.  4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM  piewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?   It needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your  window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X  session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your  window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in the background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:   exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action. Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window,  whether or not you kill or restart your window manager.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?   Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature -- which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the geometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something  close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are  looking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces.  Look for the application \\\"xplaces\\\" on an archive-server near you. There are  several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage. [10/90]  Some new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the  saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running applications and the resource database.  [Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?   DEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this,  add to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:  sm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?   You can turn auto-repeat on or off by using \\\"xset r on|off\\\". The X protocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is a capability not supported by all systems.  Some servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over  server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the  server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server  from MIT with the options \\\"-ar1 350 -ar2 30\\\" to reduce the sensitivity of the  keyboard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?   There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful  for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and  does not do \\\"macro expansion.\\\"  Some (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors,  accept a translation resource such as:  xterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\\\   <Key>F1: string(\\\"setenv DISPLAY unix:0\\\") which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control characters in the string, use \\\\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include.  Window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor has a special \\\"remapper\\\" client been made available.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  David B.

Many of our monitors, as they age, develop shadows on white and bright colors. \",\"  Dennis, I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions of $$. Customers included government (including NASA), for profit and non-profit companies. All expected a wrap (usually called a fee). Much of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors. The subcontractors where universities, for-profits, non-profits, and even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space. ALL charged fees as part of the work. Down the street is one of the NASA commercialization centers; they charge a fee.  Now, I'm sure your a competent engineer Dennis, but you clearly lack experience in several areas. Your posts show that you don't understand the importance of integration in large projects. You also show a lack of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything. This isn't a flame, jsut a statement.  Your employer DOES charge a fee. You may not see it but you do.    Well there you are Dennis. As I said, they simply include the fee in their overhead. Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depending on the customer.   Integration, Dennis, isn't overhead.   Dennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs. When WP 02 was hemoraging out a billion $$, the centers you love so much where doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem. Reston was the only place you would find people actually interested in solving the problems and building a station.   When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that integration isn't overhead. It is the single most important part of a successful large scale effort.   The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on Congress. Suprise suprise. The fact remains that it is the centers you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address the problems until the press published the story.  Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address the overruns? You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns?   You should know Dennis that NASA doesn't include transport costs for resuply. That comes from the Shuttle budget. What they where saying is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport.   I do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of Reston to ask that the problems with WP 02 be addressed.    Allen \",\" The \\\"face\\\" is an accident of light and shadow.

Sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long, and the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the Giants mystique. Or so I thought.  I went to Tuesday's game (3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins) and the 'Stick was  a much different place. Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but  everything is a lot better.

From a theological bent, those who lived immediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son Nimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a stronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of hardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on his shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.  It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and thus he became the \\\"Elevator of the heavens.\\\"  This \\\"god\\\" made men able to \\\"feel\\\" as if heaven were afar off and \\\"as if either the God of Heaven could not see through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of His laws.\\\"  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled \\\"Emancipator\\\" or \\\"Deliverer\\\"  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system and abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many benefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a Deliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God's wrath, the other actually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it as true.   I don't see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to the coming \\\"Anointed One\\\" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who was to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the Crucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the dispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it as a completed action.  Rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvation via faith and nothing else.   I understand what you're trying to convey, but I don't think I'd lay hold of it because the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the eternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternal life is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of consciousness.     It depends upon your def of \\\"lost.\\\"  The elect were lost only in time as outside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world.  Existentially we were all born \\\"lost\\\", but the \\\"righteous\\\" were \\\"in Christ\\\" and therefore never *assuredly* lost.    Maybe this summer I could find time to put together a paper on it.  I simply have to buy more books for myself, and these older books are very expensive.  Either that or countless trips to the oriental museum.   Couldn't agree with you more.  Our understanding, of say eschatology, is clearly clearer than that of, say Isaiah.  But that is not what I was referring to.    No, I understand it as you have said. This was my point.   Ah!  This is it.  This is the big question.  However, I would say, again I think, that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it.  Look at Satan's twist of God's Word when he coerced Eve.  That is a very interesting study.   >The similarity in the midst of great variety of  Yes, that is my point.  But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want the underlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as \\\"mystery\\\" religions for no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the private side, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they revealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings to light. The \\\"Mystery of Iniquity\\\" that we find in the Bible, correlates to this I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately, little by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would not have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point today might be the Masons.  (Just a note, that they too worshipped Osiris in Egypt, who can be traced to Nimrod, the \\\"husband son.\\\")   No, I disagree with you here Gerry.  I know what you're alluding to in that the church, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their worldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.  If you are a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came to expound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that which they had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned and discussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and also the trinity of God.  See if you can find Wilkinson's \\\"Egyptians.\\\"  He really does a number on what the Greeks did to what they \\\"pilfered\\\" from the Egyptians.

All conference attendees are welcome at the annual meeting, though only Consortium members will be able to vote.  This year's theme is    Application Construction by Non-Programmers  Much of the effort on X toolkits has been aimed at programmer construction of applications.  There have, however, been some excellent UIMS systems built on top of X.  Papers addressing the theme will consider questions such as  What is needed for application construction by non-programmers?  Can we avoid programming altogether, or is a simple language needed?  Is it sufficient to create applications, or must users be able to create new widgets?  Should widgets and applications be able to print themselves?  Your participation in the conference is welcome.  Papers are appropriate on the theme or any aspect of the Andrew User Interface System, including   applications  experience with users  new objects  reviews of and proposals for revision of    internal Andrew protocols  We expect to have an RS/6000 with video projector available if you would like to do a demonstration.

Perhaps you should examine in yourself why as such a good friend, you  are unwilling to accept this imortant part of your friends life?  Why  do you call into question his faith?  Your friend has changed, he has  found something that fills a need in his life.  You need to decide if  you are still his friend, whether you can accommodate his new life.   It sounds as if you are criticizing him for a fundamental belief in  the Bible, yet you are quick to reveal that your fundamental belief  that it is superstition.  Perhaps if he knew you at least took him  seriously, that you at least took an interest in the light he has found,  that you at least tried to understand what has become a special part of  his life, you could together decide to become fundamentalists, respect  each others differences and remain friends, or part ways.  Maybe even if  you stuck it out with him, you could help him to un-convert.  Of course,  if you go in with that attitude he will surely see through your intentions  and begin to resent you.  I happen to be a person very tolerant of fundamentalists, because I know that the idea of a simple black and white approach to life is appealing. I don't happen to share the beliefs of fundamentalists, but I am not offended by their prosyletizing.  I had a few good conversations with some Witnesses who came to my door.  I didn't switch my beliefs, but for those at home who maybe need a friendly face to invite them somewhere, the Witnesses provide a wonderful service.  You may have been conditioned to believe that religion is unimportant and witnessing is obnoxious, but why?  Are you afraid you might be converted and become one of them, that you will be swept up in fundamentalism, that you will become a weirdo. Friendship's a two-way street.

What about the child whose parents are crushed emotionally because he/she starts a carerr doing something they greatly dislike.

I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache. It's small enough that I will attach it.  I have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB cache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to 40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective difference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache card certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously better.  I do not have an FPU.  The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference between 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for well under $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it.  If you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I'd like to see them.

Well, I dont know if Windows is a mature OS, if I have seen one (in which case that has to be X-Windows :) ), but dont be so quick to judge...  First of all to try to use plain vanilla Windows is as courageous as to try to use plain vanilla DOS. There are _lots_ of very nice commercial and shareware packages/utilities that will boost up Windows past what MS itself thought possible :)... For example, Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0 (a replace- ment for ProgMan) will give you group-within-a-group capability and will even change group icons, it will launch progs by association (well, FileMan does that too) or by dragging the file in the apps icon (now Mac doesnt do that, huh? :) )... And the list goes on and on... Now, Windows _is_ kinda hard to finetune, boost and configure, but thats trhe price to pay for not paying $$$ to get a Mac or an OS/2 capable machine (an entirely differet story ...)... On the other hand if you dont like the idea of PM's icons not correspnding to the files themselves, well they are not supposed to :).. PM is a Program _Launching_ utility not a file manager... Modify your  settings to have FM as your shell and not PM, or get a couple of utilities from cica that supposedly give you a 'Mac feel'...

Regarding the verses relevant to nature, I prefer to use Dr. Maurice Bucaille's translations (in his book, \\\"The Bible, the Qur'an and Science\\\") for in general his translations are more literal.   Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as   \\\"...Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion.\\\"  (Also note that \\\"the celestial bodies\\\" in the first translation quoted by you above is the translator's interpolation -- it is not existent in the original Arabic, which is why it is included in brackets.)    You're right, what the verses _do_ contain isn't all that remarkable.  However, Dr. Bucaille (a surgeon, that's how he's a \\\"Dr.\\\") thinks it is significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas, even though geocentrism was all the rage up until the 17th century (?) or so. (And this goes for the rest of the Qur'an as well, which has about 750 verses or so regarding nature, I think I remember reading once.)\",\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Poem by Erich Fried    Poem by German-Jewish poet Erich Fried (Holocaust survivor)  Ein Jude an die zionistischen Kaempfer - 1988      von Erich Fried  Was wollt ihr eigentlich ?

Some of what I  would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may  never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars  as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and  a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief  in an afterlife.    The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks  and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light  crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.   Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live  in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The  impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped  into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life  forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels  (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains  one weekend, \\\"getting away from it all\\\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing,  malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed  the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80  miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters  much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.   But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't  fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever -  like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch  commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer,  truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.   If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at  least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.    To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage  of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at  8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the  local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it  if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could  be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky  while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that  as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid,  even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. \",\"Hello...

Only TV could transmit the full sadness of his face. \\\"You say that we teach our children to hate you, but what do you expect to happen to a child who sees this ?\\\" And once again he wraps himself in a lengthy silence, his face crumbling into weeping. Mahmoud stood in the field of rubble that was once his home. The term 'dispossession' has an absolute meaning here. Nothing is left of what he accumulated during his entire life, only the rubble of a house and shreds of belongings.  Once again Khan Yunis. Once again demolished homes. Last Thursday there was a search for wanted people here. Once again the IDF forces employed the new method, fired and bombed and shot missiles and placed explosives. Already three times during the past weeks I have gone out to see the destruction and each time I was more horrifying scenes. This time they hit the largest number of houses, 17 according to the IDF estimate, ten of them completely demolished. But not only that:  the method has also become more brutal. Three weeks ago, in Tufah neighborhood in Gaza, the residents were still told to remove their valuables from their homes.  This time the army skipped that part; three weeks ago the handcuffed men, inhabitants of the demolished homes, were supplied with some water and one apple during the 12 hours they had to stand. This time there was only water. Three weeks ago they were even allowed to go out to the toilet. This time the soldier just gold them: Piss and shit in your pants. And thus, last Thursday, some 45 men stood for about 12 hours, their hands bound behind their backs, their eyes blindfolded, without food, with wet pants on their legs and a terrible feeling of humiliation in their hearts, listening to the sounds of the explosions destroying their homes, one after the other.  (...)\",\"Tony-  I read your post, it was nothing new, I had seen much the same in other typical\\\"Christian\\\" anti-gay sentimental literature.  Gay people are and will con- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may be unaware of all the statistica \\\"findings\\\" concerning African-Americans that have been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias against African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances, but there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public scoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case. Fortunately African-Americans had \\\"whites\\\" who supported their 'cause' and public sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was even a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty much legal to discriminate against them.  I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something, that is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society, including gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation and making disciples.  We believe in the Lord's great commandment to Love, and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular to do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes in the commandment of Love (though I'm hard-pressed to find many who actually sho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially within their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian community for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists against the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and treated as runaway slaves for being \\\"nigger-lovers\\\" and such.  I guess I've decided the challenge is worth it.  In my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic story centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight who have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don't know of one case where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject their gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they began to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.  I'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0 raged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values Coalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner support within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more oppressive legisation against gays.  Perhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn't get it in the Middle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousands in witch hunts and inquisitions.  The message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay rights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even hatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't change the results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the final effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a \\\"conditional\\\" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we'll love you. This is sure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an \\\"unconditional\\\" love, one that calls people \\\"just as they are.\\\"  Sure there are things that will 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that need to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things like left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to \\\"other people's expectations.\\\" In the process this coerced conformity causes many people a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their own sense of pseuper-spirituality.  This is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with something very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but I firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation on thier bedrooms.  It's funny that most straight people have successfully removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation, but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society. Gay people are not criminals.  Another interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic church in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self- admitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently been going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were voluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that was how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing happen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends recently told me he was \\\"approached\\\" by someone who is going through the reparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.  These are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not the call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in Colorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over Colorado called \\\"S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T.\\\" (I forget the whole definition off hand, but the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto is \\\"Working for a fag-free America\\\" with an implicit advocation for violence.  This is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are embracing.  We Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression towards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement from organizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good purpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of excluding people.  The Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to \\\"include\\\" people.  I have several of Dr. Martin's books and find them quite helpful, especially concerning 'cults.' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto itself.  Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people to Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?  Whatever\",\" Don't be so sure.  Look what happened to Japanese citizens in the US during World War II.  If you're prepared to say \\\"Let's round these people up and stick them in a concentration camp without trial\\\", it's only a short step to gassing them without trial.  After all, it seems that the Nazis originally only intended to imprison the Jews; the Final Solution was dreamt up partly because they couldn't afford to run the camps because of the devastation caused by Goering's Total War.  Those who weren't gassed generally died of malnutrition or disease. \",\"I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly, (motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only \\\"real solution\\\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both  legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the \\\"internal nerves\\\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd  always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that \\\"force\\\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.  Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\",\" [lines deleted]   This list appears to imply, that MS-windows that has a cost listed above at $70, comes with a C compiler, C++ and Fortran.

After Huizenga announced the team name, he announced that Bill Torrey is named the first president of the Panthers.  A little Bio from _Sun-Sentinel_ Torrey, the architect of four consecutive Stanley Cup champions as  persident and general manager of the New York Islanders. Throughout his 27 years in the NHL, Bill Torrey's bow ties have become as much of a signature as Andre Agassi's hair.  The Panthers will introduce a uniform, insignia, and ticket-price  information in early next month.  In the meantime, Huizenga leaves the day-to-day operation in the hands of Torrey and Bob Clarke, the VP and GM.  The Florida Panthers was chosen as the name of South Florida's NHL team to focus attention on an endangered species.  There are 30 to 50 Florida Panthers in the Everglades National Park, the Big Cypress National  Preserve and other parts of southwestern Florida.  \\\"The Panther is the quickest-striking of all cats,\\\" Torrey said.   \\\"Hopefully that's the way we'll play on ice.\\\"  More BIO: In Torrey, Huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion Islanders in 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the Islanders to four consecutive Stanley Cup championships (their first after only eight seasons) and 14 consecutive winning seasons.  As executive vice president of the California Golden Seals, Torrey watched the Seals go to the play- offs in 1968, only their second NHL season.  \\\"I guess this completes my own personal hat trick\\\", said Torrey, 58, a native of Montreal but a resident of Bear Lakes Country Club in Palm Beach.

I would think that candida would produce signature byproducts whose measure would then set a lower bound on the  extent of recent infection.

It is not asserted to be \\\"the truth\\\" so no flames, please.  It comes out of a background of 20 years as a senior corporate staff executive in two Fortune 50 companies.  I'd be happy to use a crypto system supplied by the NSA for business, if they told me it was more secure than DES, and in particular resistant to attempts by Japanese, French, and other competitive companies and governments to break.  I'd be happy to do so even with escrowed keys, provided I was happy about the bona fides of the escrow agencies (the Federal Reserve would certainly satisfy me, as would something set up by one of the big 8 accounting firms).  I'd trust the NSA or the President if they stated there were no trap doors--I'd be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined the thing under seal of secrecy and reported back that it was secure.  I'd trust something from the NSA long before I'd trust something from some Swiss or anybody Japanese.  This may seem surprising to some here, but I suggest most corporations would feel the same way. Most/many/some (pick one) corporations have an attitude that the NSA is part of our government and \\\"we support our government\\\", as one very famous CEO put it to me one day.

The correct analogy is not with aviation of the '30's, but the long transocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didn't require gov't to fund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit at the destination.  In practice, some were gov't funded, some were private. But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.   I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop, and large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you ask me for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, I can't give them.  We just don't know enough.  The launch rate demanded by existing space industries is just too low to bring costs down much, and we are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industries will be, when they will practical, how much will have to be invested to start them, etc. \",\" : ...

Later,\",\" The Supreme Court seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that \\\"the people\\\" is a term of art refering to an individual right, and have explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example.  I quote:    \\\"... 'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in   select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the   Constitution is ordained, and established by 'the people of the   the U.S.'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people   to keep and bear Arms ....\\\"  - Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).  Furthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution for possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not presented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the government that such weapons have no military value -- they held that the amendment protected the individual right to possess military weapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully gotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the interpretation.  Furthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:   \\\"The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,   and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the   United States, as well as its interpretation by every major   commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-   cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right   of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.\\\"    - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the      Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,      97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )  You might rightfully ask \\\"well then, what does that first bit about militias mean?\\\"  Well, \\\"militia\\\" in historical context basically means the whole of the adult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines \\\"militia\\\" as all armed men over the age of 17).     \\\"The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting     in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were     expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of     the kind in common use at the time.\\\"  - Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).  The reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale behind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to bear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military power could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the government would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than the other way around.     \\\"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason    for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last    resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\\\"      - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776        1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C. J. Boyd, Ed., 1950).     \\\"And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not    warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of    resistance ?  Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be    refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\\\"      - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith, 1787, in        Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939).     \\\"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;    as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.  The supreme    power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword;    because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute    a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on    any pretense, raised in the United States.\\\"      - Noah Webster, \\\"An Examination into the Leading Principles        of the Federal Constitution\\\" (1787), in Pamphlets on the        Constitution of the United States (P.

And also better, because a neurologist can make a differential diagnosis between migraine, tension-type headache, cluster, benign intracranial hypertension, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, and other headache syndromes that all appear normal on a scan.

DN> >>Also, since many people are convinced they have brain tumors or other DN> >>serious pathology, it may be cheaper to just get a CT scan then have DN> >>them come into the ER every few weeks. DN> And easier than taking the time to reassure the patient, right? DN> Personally, I don't think this can ever be justified.  Sigh.  It may never be justifiable, but I sometimes do it.  Even after I try to show thoroughness with a detailed history, neurologic examination, and discussion with the patient about my diagnosis, salted with lots of reassurance, patients still ask \\\"why can't you order a scan, so we can be absolutely sure?\\\"  Aunt Millie often gets into the conversation, as in \\\"they ignored Aunt Millie's headaches for years\\\", and then she died of a brain tumor, aneurysm, or whatever.  If you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a patient with an obviously benign headache syndrome, I'd like to hear what your magic is.  Every once in a while I am able to bypass imaging by getting an EEG. Mind you, I don't think EEG is terribly sensitive for brain tumor, but the patient feels like \\\"something is being done\\\" (as if the hours I spent talking with and examining the patient were \\\"nothing\\\"), the EEG has no ionizing radiation, it's *much* cheaper than CT or MRI, and the EEG brings in some money to my department.\",\"  Well, despite what my mother told me about accepting dares, here goes.   You have to be very careful about what you mean by \\\"question authority\\\". Taken literally, it is nonsense. That which is authoratative is authoratative, and to say \\\"I question to word of this authority\\\" is ridiculous. If it is  open to question, it isn't an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectly reasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrase here should be \\\"authenticate authority.\\\" Once you have authenticated your authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as an authority.   The difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You  can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency in what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of discourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, in inself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and  other that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.) I cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings,  because if I can independantly verify its teachings, I don't need an  authority. I need an authority only when there is information I need which I cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I must do it by some means other than by examining its teachings.   In practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don't have time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientist woring today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts of knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to  verify for himself.  In spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source  ofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I am a Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seem the strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter for belief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).  The atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is a reasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty. If you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of every receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possibly change. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific.   To demand scintific or rational proof of God's existence, is to deny God's existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very nature, prove anything.   \",\"  >In article <1993Apr19.020359.26996@sq.sq.com>, msb@sq.sq.com (Mark Brader)   MB>                                                             So the MB> 1970 figure seems unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove.

He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugs and that did not seem to help out. His MRI, EKG, cat-scans are all normal, but the EEG's show alot of seizure activity. After many metabolic tests, body structure tests, and infection/virus tests the doctors still do not know quite what type of siezures he is having (although they do have alot of evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms ).

My goal is for this keyboard to look exactly like an AT sytle keyboard to its host system. This will be a highly endowed keyboard with a Little PCL from Z World at its heart.  The only thing I lack is detailed information on the hardware signaling that the 486 (with  Windows 3.1  and DOS 5.0) will be  expecting.  My project is independant of Windows, my hope is that some of you fellow Window's users/programmers will recognize what I need and be  willing to point me in the right direction.   I have The Winn L. Rosch Hardware Bible (2nd edition).  The HB gives most (if not all) of the information I will need concerning scan codes  and even a wire diagram for the PS/2 style connector I will need, but it  leaves a number of important questions unanswered. 1.  Is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication?  I'm     guessing synchronous since the host is providing a clock.  In either     event, how is the data framed? 2.  Is it half-duplex or truly one way?  I'm guessing half-duplex     since the host can turn LEDs on and off. 3.  Are there any chipsets available for communicating with the \\\"AT     keyboard standard\\\" (other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard)?  If anyone knows of a book or article (or any other written source of information) on the above, please advise me at gamet@erg.sri.com. Whatever I do it must be safe for I cannot afford to replace the 486 in the event of a booboo.  Thank you for your time. Danke fuer Ihre Zeit.\",\"Dunno about Miller.

I'll continue to re-post periodically until *** he answers them, publicly indicates that he won't answer them, *** stops posting to alt.atheism, the alt.atheism community tells *** me to stop, or I get totally bored.  I apologize for the  *** somewhat juvenile nature of this approach, but I'm at a loss *** to figure out another way to crack his intransigence and  *** seeming intellectual dishonesty. *** *** This is re-post #3.   Charley,  I can't help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your previous posts.  I submit that you don't answer them because you cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic, and I once again challenge you to prove me wrong.  To make the task as easy for you as possible, I'll present concise re-statements of some of the questions that you have failed to answer, in the hope that you may address them one at a time for all to see.  Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period, I will re-post this article, with suitable additions and deletions, at such time that I notice a post by you on another topic.  I will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or you cease to post to this newsgroup.  I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these questions previously and your answer missed my notice.  If you can be kind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles, I will be only too pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question, and remove it from this list.  Now, to the questions...  1. After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating that you weren't referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some atheists who you feel don't fit your patterns, to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your stereotype?  Here is the context for the question:    2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that \\\"senses and reason are all we have to go by\\\", and when pressed, you have implied that we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and reason.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...   then later...   then later...    3.  You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by a.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical.  I asked you to identify one such claim that I have made.  You have failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical?  If so, please repeat them.  Here is the context for the question:    then later...    4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the \\\"axioms\\\" of reason that one couldn't help but become atheist.  I asked you to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that I have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer the question.  Please do so now.  Question: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become atheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that effect?  If you don't retract that claim, do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism?  Here is the context for the question:  [First quote] [Second quote]   5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer these Challenges because they contained too much in the way of \\\"included text\\\" from previous posts.  Later, you implied that you wouldn't respond because I was putting words in your mouth.  Please clarify this seeming contradiction.  Question:  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context from your own posts, or that I paraphrase your positions in order to avoid \\\"included text\\\"?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...    As usual, your responses are awaited with anticipation.  --Dave Wood   p.s., For the record, below is a compilation of Charley's responses to these challenges to date.  3/18/93  3/31/93 (#1)  3/31/93 (#2)\",\"Nick Haines sez;  Level 5?

The psoriasis is under control but the arthritis part of the illness is not.  Ansaid (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) worked pretty well for three years but isn't helping much now.  My friend is now taking Meclomen (another NSAID) but this isn't helping control the pain at all.  In the past two months my friend has also started taking Azulfadine along with the NSAID medicines, but the effects of the combined drugs aren't supposed to be realized for several months.  As a result of the pain, my friend is having problems sleeping.  Staying in one position too long is an ordeal.  Another major contributor to pain is that tendonitis has now developed (left thumb and hand with numbness at the base of the palm; bottom of feet; shoulders and outer thighs).  The tendonitis is quite painful yet my friend's doctor has not recommended any form of treatment to relieve it.  The latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and is now recommending Prednisone.  The hope is that the Prednisone will relieve some of the pain from the tendonitis.  My friend is a 41 year old male who feels like he's 80 (his words, not mine).   If anyone is aware of any new treatments for Psoriatic Arthritis, alternative courses of action, support groups or literature on it, I would be extremely grateful if you could e-mail to me.

The ultimate statement for equal rights (something many of the feminazis have forgotten) is \\\"I do not care if you are either a man or a woman, I do not care if you are black or white, I do not care if you are gay or straight.\\\" Once you can honistly say \\\"I do not care about color, race, or gender or sexual preference\\\", then we will truly be on the right track.  Keep shoving differences in my face and then expect us all to get along? Get real! So long as you try to make me care if you are black, female, or whatever, I am going to continue to balk. It's natural human behaviour.  But the moment employers searching for employees, banks looking to lend money, and theClinton administration looking for appointees can honistly say \\\"I do not care about your color, race, gender, or sexual preferences; I instend instead to treat you as a human being,\\\" crap like last year's riots will continue to happen.   Barf.  You mean the same economic theorists who say things like \\\"for the sake of convenience in mathematical modeling we will first assume there is no wealth creation\\\" now get a crack at implementing their PhD thesis in real life?  Go back to your textbooks on macroeconomic theory. Look in the first chapter of that book, introducing the field of macroeconomic theory. Right there in chapter 1, section 1, is a statement like the following:   \\\"As it is difficult to predict and model wealth creation,  especially in an economy where wealth creation is inherently  the province of individuals who create new inventions and  discover new ideas, we will assume for the rest of this  book that there is no wealth creation.   \\\"We do not assume the lack of weath creation in the real world,  however the mathematical modeling of such an inherently  unpredictable subject is impossible. Even though we assume  no wealth creation, we do believe that for most mathematical  economic modeling such an assumption is reasonably valid  as it allows us to make predictions which then can be tested.\\\"  So the guys who are running the store for Clinton and company are now assuming that wealth creation does not exists. They are (borrowing an idea from the Hitchhiker's Guide) too advanced to think of these simple things.  To be honist, I would rather have an engineer with years of experience building bridges design the next bridge, rather than a theoretical physicists with a freshly minted PhD and no experience do the same job.       - Bill Woody\",\"The Orders for the Turkish Extermination of the Armenians #17     To the children of genocide: \\\"Send them away into the Desert\\\"  This is part of a continuing series of articles containing official Turkish  wartime (WW1) governmental telegrams, in translation, entailing the orders  for the extermination of the Armenian people in Turkey. Generally, these telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, for example, we have the following set regarding children:   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to   the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum   [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem   families and received as servants when they are left alone through   the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect   all such children in your province and send them to the places of   deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to   the people.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [1]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the   time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their   lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.      Minister of the Interior,       Talaat\\\" [2]   \\\"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.    November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the   orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their   places of exile.        Abdullahad Nuri. [3]    \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been   opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is   done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt   of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or   any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it   purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as   detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received   into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish   special orphanages for them.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat.\\\" [4]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.     Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures   to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with   the caravans.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [5]   \\\"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.    At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows   of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is   not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by   Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble   in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned   out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of   deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent   away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [6]  In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \\\"rationalizing\\\" this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:   \\\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for   its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks   it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I   shall die for it.\\\" [7]   These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never questioned these \\\"death march orders\\\" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.  For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.  If one were to examine the sample \\\"authentic text\\\" provided in the Turkish  Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it  too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the  Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or  Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery.   Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul, Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide  architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a  heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.  This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian.     - - - references - - -  [1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60  [2] ibid, page 60  [3] ibid, page 60  [4] ibid, page 61  [5] ibid, page 61  [6] ibid, page 62  [7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and     London), 1926, page 387  \",\" : Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.

You can't simply divide the world into atheists and non-atheists on the basis of god-belief.  If all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity, and have nothing to say about behaviour, then belief in a supernatural being is your criterion.  But once you start talking about behaviour, then someone's suscept- ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you  are - I assume - worried about.  And in that area, what you care about is whether someone is sceptical, critical and autonomous on the one hand, or gullible, excitable and easily led on the other.  I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates that a person is easily led.

When he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration, X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window, giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.     The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables.     Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?\",\"  Why would you say \\\"especially Christianity\\\"? \",\": From: brad@optilink.COM (Brad Yearwood)  : Assume in this case the usual canard-adversary of narcotraficantes.

They certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this was not necessarily their true position.   The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question. The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914 and David Llloyd George's budget. Even despite this the House of Lords has considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body.     The system is meant to be slow to react, the problem is that it ended up a bit too slow.    The Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely separate.

This is a second RFD, replacing the one originally posted in January '93 (and never taken to a vote).  The proposed groups are described below:  NAME:   comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup STATUS:  Unmoderated. PURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about   system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.  NAME:  comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc STATUS:  Unmoderated. PURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,   including issues such as security, networking features, console   mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.  RATIONALE:  Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family  of operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish  to argue about the meaning of an \\\"OS\\\").  The family ranges from  Modular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to  Windows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over  50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the  actual release is slated for May/June '93.   While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares  an application programming interface with the other members of the  Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-  dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking  and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for  Windows 3.1.   The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows  3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses  Program Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-  sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced  Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and  NT also runs existing 3.1 applications.   Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following  groups with the other members of the Windows family:   comp.os.ms-windows.apps   comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools   comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc   comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32    The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as  well as Windows 3.1:   comp.os.ms-windows.announce   comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy    In conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the  Windows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal  structures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating  systems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have  undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate  newsgroup hierarchies.   Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --  when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-  generation Windows, \\\"Chicago\\\", debuts next year, surely it should  remain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-  tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?   DISCUSSION PERIOD:  The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.    VOTING:  The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on  the feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will  be accepted prior to the CFV.\",\"(NDW)  If an Uninstall icon doesn't exist in the Norton Desktop Apps group:\",\"For all people that are interested in every aspect of the 2600 try the zine:  2600 connection $1 cash to : Timothy Duarte PO Box N, 664 Westport, MA 02790  for sample   \",\"Good luck.  \",\"Does anyone out there have the shorthanded goal totals of the NHL players for this season?

The people of  Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never  abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally  hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved.

Greece was the sole  perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July  15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop  Makarios.  Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with  the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right  given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently  and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For  those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island  since 1571.   The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences  for this irresponsible conduct.               THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM  2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus  It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the 24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum.  AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS  The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed...  The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent, are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.  Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event.  \\\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs. Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain. Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard voices saying, in  Greek, \\\"You want Taksim eh!\\\"  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks, who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.  When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was brutally murdered.  In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying \\\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\\\"  I became terrified. I thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed.  An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who were all wounded.  We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik.  There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter.  After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus, Greeks arrested me at the Airport.  All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my detention. They then released me.\\\"  ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER  We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days.  We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some terrible sights.  In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A child's bicycle lay in a corner.  In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother.  In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head.  This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.  Today was five days later, and still they lay there.  Rene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the \\\"DAILY EXPRESS\\\")  \\\"...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant children murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer...\\\"  Max CLOS, LE FIGARO 25-26 January, 1964    Peter Moorhead reporting from the village of Skyloura, Cyprus.   Date : 1 January, 1964.    IL GIARNO (Italy)    THEY ARE TURK-HUNTING, THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM.   Discussions start in London; in Cyprus terror continues. Right now we  are witnessing the exodus of Turks from the villages. Thousands of people  abandoning homes, land, herds; Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless. This   time, the rhetoric of the Hellenes and the bust of Plato do not suffice to   cover up barbaric and ferocious behaviors.   Article by Giorgo Bocca, Correspondent of Il Giorno  Date: 14 January 1964   DAILY HERALD (London)   AN APPALLING SIGHT  And when I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight. Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.  In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16  wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.    DAILY TELEGRAPH (London)    GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE   Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the  Turkish Sector of Nicosia, as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found  crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios, 13 miles away, were  brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three   more bodies, including one of a woman, were discovered nearby but could  not be removed. Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to   locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site.

I would call it the granite years, reflecting the primitive nature of it.  It was  romantic, swashbuckling daredevils,  \\\"those daring young men in their flying machines\\\".  But in reality, it sucked.  Death was a highly likely occurence,  and  the environment blew.  Ever see the early navy pressure suits,  they were modified  diving suits.  You were ready to star in \\\"plan 9 from outer space\\\".   Radios  and Nav AIds were a joke,  and engines ran on castor oil.  They  picked and called aviators \\\"men with iron stomachs\\\",  and it wasn't due to vertigo.  Oddly enough, now we are in the golden age of flight.  I can hop the shuttle to NY for $90 bucks,  now that's golden.  Mercury gemini, and apollo were romantic,  but let's be honest. Peeing in bags,  having plastic bags glued to your butt everytime you needed a bowel movement.  Living for days inside a VW Bug. Romantic,  but not commercial.   The DC-X  points out a most likely new golden age.  An age where  fat cigar smoking business men in loud polyester space suits will fill the skys with strip malls and used space ship lots.  hhhmmmmm,  maybe i'll  retract that golden age bit.   Maybe it was better in the old days.  Of course, then we'll have  wally schirra telling his great grand children, \\\"In my day,  we walked on the moon. Every day.

At first, I thought it was the video driver and    made sure I had the most current drivers, because the problem was most   evident at SVGA resolution modes.  It didn't help and after a bit of   experimentation, determined that the problem existed in standard VGA   resolution mode. It was just much less noticeable.      My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in 1990. It   worked just fine in DOS and DOS based graphic applications.  On the    guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse, I borrowed   a new mouse (a MS bus model) and tried it.  That solved the problem.   So, if your mouse is old, you may want to try replacing it for a newer   one.      --  signoff\",\" This would be one of the results of \\\"U.S. backed  PEACE!!!!!!\\\" process.

As many knowledgeable people have pointed out, msg is a naturally  occurring substance in a lot, if not most, foods.  When food  manufacturers add it to a preparation, they do so because it's a  known flavor enhancer.   Your wife's theory, that MSG is added to food to stimulate appetite,  may well be true.

No motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed, unless you call failing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use \\\"slower\\\" RAM in a machine.  You either set the number of wait states to accomodate the slow RAM (in which case, all memory will run at that slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash.  Putting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine it has faster RAM.    Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus  slowed down to accomodate slow RAM.

Come on, Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant. Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders.   YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**. Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you get them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a coach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto game, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.  But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel doesn't have a game like that in him.   Don't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about Roussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was to have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah, Dom has played well too.   FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a team picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the same picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning, Kasper...   Mostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certain autographs on the team photos. I don't like that method since I've seen guards help out people get things like Lindros pictures, surely if they got their hands on an autographed picture they'd hold 'em for their buddies.\",\" Let's get back to basics.  Canon (from the latin) means a rule.  If we say that a rule is open then its a rule made to be broken.   There is an issue also of measurement against a rule.  Thus the words that are spoken need to be compared against the rule/canon but not added to the canon.  Is new revelation necessary?  Topical, current, personal revelation I'd say is necessary.  New revelation for all people for all times is not necessary as we have that in Scripture.  You also seem to confuse canon with scripture.  Scripture may speak of itself being open - ie God speaking today.  It would speak that it is closed in the sense that the canon is unchangeable.  (Though the concept of canon is later historically.)   I agree with the problem of confusion.  If prophecy is meant to encourage, exhort or correct then is an overlap with scripture.  If prophecy is meant to bring a `word' of the form \\\"the man you live with is not your husband\\\" then that is knowledge.  Yet the exact words their are scripture. I would expect the difference to be the motive and means for delivery. The reading of scripture itself can be a powerful force.  Regards  David\",\"  I was there in 1976.  I suppose it must have died out since 1946, then.  Certainly I never heard of any homeopaths or herbalists in the employ of the NHS.

A similar law in the US allows chiropractors to practice in VA hospitals but I've never seen one there and I don't know of a single VA that has hired a chiropractor.

Arab governments generally don't care much about the Palestineans and their struggle but find it useful for political purposes back home. They are happy to leave the Palestineans largely under Israeli control because that leaves the job of controlling them to the Israelis.  The Israelis don't like this job any more than King Hussein of Jordan liked it -- and he managed to kill them off at the rate of thousands per month when they started an Intifada in Jordan.  The governments of Syria, Lebanon and Egypt all feel similarly.  However, proclaiming public support for the Palestinean war against Israel deflects criticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to even the most brutal Arab tyrants.  Arab *PEOPLE* probably aren't much more sympathetic.  Palestineans have shown a willingness to destabilize and plunder in Jordan, Lebanon and Kuwait and are viewed with suspicion elsewhere.  You might still be right in sympathy to the war against Israel, but I suspect that many Arabs, far removed from the immediate border with Israel (e.g. in Kuwait or Morroco), couldn't care less. \",\"The following 4 addresses are on the LymeNet mailing list, but are rejecting mail.

It is also closer to 4 m in diameter.   You've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized.  It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally,  the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi.  That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure  stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions (when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make  a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching.   The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur does. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the  cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be  done there........    The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it  lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don't know what the proton uses  for fuel, but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they  use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's  do.

Adam        Adam Shostack            adam@das.harvard.edu\",\"The primary problem in human nature is a \\\"fragmentation of being.\\\" Humans are in a state of tension, a tension of opposites. Good and evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.  The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of being. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's rebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of the Scriptures.  Man was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words of St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, this is called \\\"theosis,\\\" or \\\"deification.\\\"  One can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul, and body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs was a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the Creator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God, their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly irreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in their lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.  The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it were to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil, its paradisiac state would also be destroyed.  Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of innocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining of self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His masterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?  God must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral value, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There is no other way to achieve union with God.  Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities. He was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites, and making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God, not in His essence, but in His energies.  The opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the answer to his dilemma in vs 25.\",\"Well i'm not sure about the story nad it did seem biased.

For some non fiction, read Tom Clancy's article _Five Minutes Till Midnight_.  It shows how a terrorist group could construct a nuke using Neptunium, a low grade radioactive waste product dumped in toxic waste sites and forgotten about.

Doug Holland  -- \",\"  Any projectile traveling at or near typical bullet speeds is potentially lethal.  Even blanks [which have no projectile] can cause death if the muzzle is in close proximity to the victim.  I have heard of rubber or plastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations [where the intent is crowd control, rather than close range self defense]; i've also seen reports of deaths caused by them [the British in Northern Ireland].  Use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the gravest of situations; at that point, i consider deadly [lethal] force to  be a proper reaction [and so does the law].    Furthermore, use of less effective [but still potentially lethal] force has its own set of problems.  It may well take more applications of the less effective force to stop the incident; this places all parties at some risk; the victim because the attack has not stopped, and the assailent  since the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well be more deadly. \",\"As I was created in the image of Gaea, therefore I must be the pinnacle of creation, She which Creates, She which Births, She which Continues.

That's not the only interstate I've seen with such deviations, but it's one I drive frequently.  Texas is pretty much an edge-case -- you can't assume that everywhere has roads in such good condition, such flat terrain, and such wide-open spaces.  It just ain't so.\",\"Here are some recent observations taken by the Hubble Space Telescope:       o The Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) was used to make ultraviolet        observations of both the planet Pluto, and its moon Charon.

Reproduced under open license granted by Audio Books, Inc.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  This is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington, DC  20006.     Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30, 1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.    It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South Atlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute between Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's far more than that.     The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a giant military operation.  During this month of April 1982, fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South Atlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on all sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the Southern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.     Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of the Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a counterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.     To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of time, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is coming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are overextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannot simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time without drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no matter how risky they may be.     There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no choice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That reason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered losses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by the British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts will the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle losses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice but to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking even heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short, my friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.     The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange, ironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearing countless commentators referring to the British task force as an \\\"armada\\\" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very uneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400 years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force, but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it changed the course of history--and it was none other than the English navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.     The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the reign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England.  They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake and his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada by changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped with new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of reach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered the big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely half the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake's defeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened the door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its expansion into a truly global empire.     Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full circle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the world empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now the cultures of England and of Spain are once again in confrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for invasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four hundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day; today, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.     The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake Passage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of the Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's naval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may well break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal Navy.     My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:  Topic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND Topic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE Topic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.  Topic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and a half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great Britain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the Falklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been countless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it calls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing in the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about them.     The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba is from the United States, and they are not much of a prize.  After 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer than 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the remote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over, and yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are watching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.     The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all about its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's doorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it's got at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight.  Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and submarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and sent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada numbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has already been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.     Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's this fight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the major media is \\\"oil.\\\"  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist under the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands, but that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina this month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island.     South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with no known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South Georgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia Island is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys, glaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable.  On top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or historical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it stands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.     In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by Argentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took over the Island.  For that and other historical reasons, Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina, not Britain.     But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It has always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or Spain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even more unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina's leaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They were well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island could not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island was retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina's military junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia Island at all?     My friends, the answers to all these questions are military, not political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an enormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installation buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island.  The real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret installation, together with two other similar installations which I will describe shortly.     The secret military complexes have been in existence for many years; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear war timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in Washington.  For the past two months I've been reporting the details of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain and verify them.     The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of this year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat that caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.     What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of the Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The mutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the Rockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin are behind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of the \\\"PROJECT Z\\\" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase is to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both Russia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR ONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around the world.     The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are working with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of other countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in Government war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie smoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered remains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the open.  They will confront the world with the only remaining fresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using that military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of the world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off NUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel and Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a race against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.     Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are benefitting from war preparations which were started by the Rockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since the Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United States Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United States Government has been a house divided, torn by internal power struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions.  But before that, the United States had been dominated for decades both economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller Brothers.     In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world domination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half secret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28.  It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret while appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the details, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By deliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United States would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia.  Then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be unleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.     When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the Rockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the late 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that the war being planned would have very different effects on the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern Hemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great Britain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the strategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are relatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern Hemisphere war.     In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas not initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the war clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is very little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from the North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then it works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image of this process takes up the southern half of the planet.  Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone, but very little of the air changes places.     The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming nuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for generations to come; but if the calculations are right, the Southern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war.  This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A quick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller cartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I discussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson Rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during the war.  He accomplished this as so-called \\\"Coordinator of Hemispheric Defense\\\" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  So that takes care of the South American continent and its natural resources.     Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller control was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa, especially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the efforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER No. 36.     Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land masses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and New Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the Rockefellers.     The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military installations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming war.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the surviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern Hemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually recovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire would be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third generation Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to inherit the Earth.     In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after the war, some means would have to be available to project military power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against Rockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the beam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar military domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based in the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the Northern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in existing shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built and they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no small task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built.  The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and naval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear attack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered prematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.     The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection against attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all these plans were still in the early stages of development, the answer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to Sweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden naval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs which come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off with enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.     The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided that a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the Swedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of candidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered coastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong.  Other areas were rejected because they were too close to the equator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too many people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy impossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for the secret naval installations be totally secure politically.     At last the sites for the secret naval installations were selected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was selected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme importance in the coming war.     In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located close together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South Island where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes down virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of the installation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island, which is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island facility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.     The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since World War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even closer to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location is far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep under mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also too deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New Zealand site is well situated to command the entire South Pacific.     In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found.  That site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located perfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The tall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret installation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island.  It is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of New Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the northeast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from the secret new installation which was being built, but Britain took no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down.  Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia Island except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.     Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New Zealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's.  The techniques were adapted from those used previously to build other large underground facilities, such as the NORAD installation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve construction access directly from the sea instead of overland.  In this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in appearance both during and after construction.     The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well camouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When sealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you know exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction projects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying around to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house the secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and debris was disposed of at sea.     Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake disarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed greatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal role in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamara presided over the public paring back of America's visible military power.  This included the closing down and dismantling of entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that shipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends, was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in New Zealand and South Georgia Island!     The secret naval installations have been used as duplication facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and built here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two ships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is an exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing techniques.     The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret installations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of certain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear powered--nuclear \\\"subs\\\"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers; and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin was built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and for the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been financed through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we constantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft whose manufacture was financed the same way!     The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are all duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the secret naval ships possess one key difference.     Last month I revealed that the so-called \\\"Stealth Program\\\" has succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility shield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance by distorting light waves in its vicinity.     A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into crash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of the secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been outfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes because there is more room for the powerful equipment that generates the field.     After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American Bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on earth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world domination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my friends, but three years ago they lost control of the United States Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are in control, and they are bent on war.     These secret naval installations have precipitated what is being called the \\\"Falklands crisis.\\\"  Topic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described \\\"PROJECT Z\\\", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR WAR ONE.     An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in Washington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strike the first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war with Russia.     Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable war bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in stalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United States and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand strategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially their secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and rule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it will be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks themselves, this outcome will constitute victory.     Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two months ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for nuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is fast running out.     The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward war; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in this race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are equally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the Bolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the new anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two mutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in certain ways.     In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a limited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting between Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning point in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality, and is responsible for the so-called \\\"Falkland crisis\\\" now dominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new relationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far short of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be settled between them, but for the time being they have called a truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly enemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.     The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to slow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war.  If they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller cartel in certain political movements which I discussed last summer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war timetable will also give more breathing space for additional anti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.     The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February that military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very quickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.     The exact details of the \\\"PROJECT Z\\\" war plan are not known to either the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines are known to be as I described last month.     It was decided that military action should be devised that would undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the Bolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the Southern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone.  The Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these bases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to attack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.     It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both secret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be attacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the Bolshevik war plan still workable.     Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault on the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was no combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside world.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the very war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.     But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different matter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was also its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected the secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military assault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her long-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.     As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has dominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives were sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government military junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland Islands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to enable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine generals were not told everything about the situation by any means, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to do.     As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were promised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the shooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine hands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military assistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the troubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards, the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.     On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack plan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things, landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia Island.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old buildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they also raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British, always nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as expected.  The British Antarctic survey ship \\\"Endurance\\\" put 22 Marines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down the Argentine flag.     The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine Junta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a boil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that South Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered that way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now came in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from Argentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.     During late March, Argentine military forces started assembling for an assault on the Falklands.  \\\"Nothing new\\\", thought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out threatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed that they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine forces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this time they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine public statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims to the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next day a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia Island.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance initially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point of view; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were overpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13 alleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint Rockefeller-Russian attack plan.     Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine forces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected.  Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the cavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was set up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian members concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening, April 3, the military high command in London finally learned what was really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under attack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling of the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next step was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a weapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it would be a nerve gas.     The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the British government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be described, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the so-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik controlled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, \\\"Me, too\\\" any time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against Russia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective countries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered that their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.     Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval armada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of the day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding around the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling would break through into the roof of the naval base in about three weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South Georgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend themselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships were ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to sail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with tactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance doors would be suicide.     On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was seized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports.  The same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He was forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the Rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack preparations.     That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other secret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina.  The two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on \\\"Red Alert.\\\"  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin base were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at sea undergoing \\\"sea trials\\\", but that still left seven (7) major ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the nuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.     On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister, Costa Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy.  Costa Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from certain officials.  He got them!     For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories about the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while negotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story.  The Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as possible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived in time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The official stories about \\\"slow movement\\\" of the British armada were intended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be, the fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island, then it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the announced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South Georgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.     It was initially expected that advance elements of the British fleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two weeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint Rockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it was completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a shambles of the plan.     Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent left Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was announced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into trouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on South Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In moments the ship was without any command, its communications and radar silenced.  Then a Russian \\\"sub\\\" closed in and quickly finished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is known, there were no survivors.     This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two results, both important:  First, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic by the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a configuration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost valuable time.  Public announcements from London about the progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for arrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching out longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint commando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.  The other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was flashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible action.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting involved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could be in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the seven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in southern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational headquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast of New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to provide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible to communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I explained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the Stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded communication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes headquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South Georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of South America.  The deployment of the available ships of the South Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint Rockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in New Zealand!     The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed by other events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out of port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos Aires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he was there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top Governmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have revealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four days later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded his plane, Haig somberly told reporters, \\\"Time is running out.\\\"  And so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.     The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the hollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military analysts in London had not expected that it could be completed until at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was still out of range.     The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the long hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the effects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed everyone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside sufficiently to badly disable them.     Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging on the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands awaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to the eye due to their protective shields, which also protect against beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the tactics which the Russians employed.     Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships using their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF.  As I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which PRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations of the ships to the attack submarines.  The \\\"subs\\\" were armed with special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to explode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective shield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode.  Within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik Stealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went their Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from around the world.     The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local time.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23.  That evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public with the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was wearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught always to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning from ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian military operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret Bolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out, bottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific fleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won the secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.  Topic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression that war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real war in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That aftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been promised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.     At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing for a public announcement that the United States will side with Britain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat up fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to fight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be explained without a public battle; but by fighting, the Bolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and tragic defeat for the Royal Navy.     Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now concentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On all sides now we are hearing about the so-called \\\"nuclear freeze movement.\\\"  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent months, there have even been referenda popping up on election ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are banding together to warn the public about what would happen if there were a nuclear war.     We are being told that all this is just popping up spontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet now we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you believe that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never, and I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and money--and plenty of it.     What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations machine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefeller cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it does, they will lose everything because they are not in a position to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the Rockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is a war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in its power to prevent a nuclear war.     The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them and Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this does not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the Rockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessity right now for the Rockefellers.     The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with the Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of the deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear war; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of reckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.     The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective with their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is renewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old dream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly provided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar campaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan Administration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people.  The Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on that latent fear as a tool of power.     These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands crisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new super-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the bill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new organization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working name, though this may be changed, is the \\\"World Nonproliferation Council.\\\"  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of nuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be to use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.                         LAST MINUTE SUMMARY     Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO LETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called Falkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret Bolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern Hemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down the nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the results remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal Navy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain's Waterloo at sea may well be at hand.     My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our United States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They differ in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we are ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture tells us, our Lord \\\"...has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, of love, and of a sound mind.\\\"  We must learn to wage peace.  As our Lord declared long ago, \\\"Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.\\\"\",\"                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  I thought it was:  \\\"There are two kinds of people in the world.

Ahola had only played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose Mercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been spectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points); it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn out to be ... Peter Ahola.  #24 DOUG WILSON  Season: 16th Acquired: '91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and   2nd round pick in '92 entry draft Grade:  I (B)  I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out. Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which, unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for 2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be Wilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.  #29 DEAN KOLSTAD  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (C-/D+)  It's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of games (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games, he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with the Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in his level of performance to have any chance of making the team.  #38 PAT MACLEOD  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (?)  MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my memory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with Kansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment, a \\\"rehab assignment\\\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs. Since he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive skills.  #41 TOM PEDERSON  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (B+)  Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated by injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours truly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in 43 games.  However, his size (5' 9\\\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically, on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach. But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.  #45 CLAUDIO SCREMIN  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (D+/D)  He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a small sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is quickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or defense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that will go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.\",\" This claim was made when someone spotted training film footage spliced into the footage of the actual spacewalk.\",\" I'm not surprised that you see no wisdom in them.  That is because your premises are wrong from the word \\\"Go\\\".  You claim that Christianity is based on blind faith, but this simply is not so.  Just look at the current thread on the evidence for Jesus' resurrection for evidence that Jesus was real and that he triumphed over death.  Furthermore, you say that Christians hold to their beliefs \\\"regardless of any evidence that you may find to the contrary.\\\"  Without any evidence to support your claim, this statement is little more than an ad hominem  argument.  Mind you, I don't mean this as a personal attack.  I'm merely pointing out the intellectual dishonesty behind condemning Christianity in this fashion. It would make much more sense if you could prove that all Christians do  base their belief on empty nothings, and that they do ignore all evidence to  the contrary.  Only then can you expect your attack to make sense.  \",\"                    ^^^^^^^ Huh!  I though Beamers were IBM employees :-)\",\" I think the point is being missed - that it is apparantly acceptable for Big Government (Big Brother?) to use TANKS to control the people, as long as they don't use the BIG GUN (but everything else is allright...).  Tanks deployed against civilians, let alone FIRING on them with crew served weaponry (a .50 Heavy Machine Gun is crew-served) is something both our press and government howl about instantly when done in some other country.  Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time LIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind the tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifle or pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And \\\"snipers\\\" too often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire.  I don't know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but the idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything that pretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feels it is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even violent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally out of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war on its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility, government of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the 'lords' and other elites who want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn't feel the need to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military boot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced that it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances redressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that will exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been unresponsive or such acts wouldn't be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse to open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever. Its the old 'might makes right' philosophy that is the hallmark of a government going rogue:  They don't like it? Tough. We will simply squash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances in other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too inconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep them in the dark, Smother them with shit, and Crush them when ready...  And these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things so that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that are than expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn't PROGRESSIVE or doesn't fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)...  Unbelievable.  And I do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation, that it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun into a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among many explosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000 pound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall, and some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources of buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as gunfire, including 50's tacking away, it would not stand out that much, and could be explained by \\\"musta been a gas leak... \\\".  I think it could be done and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It is not like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon, turning and firing, you know.  THAT would stand out, and be pretty impossible to cover up.   \",\"Hi.

And for those who will argue that the animals out there stealing cars and everything else (not to mention committing COMPLETELY senseless acts of violence, such as rape) cannot be valued in terms of money because they are human beings, I submit that they are not human beings.

This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary,  ether sucking structures, AND why we observe \\\"orbital\\\" motion!!    Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic  waves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the  Michelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago.     I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact  that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the  earth's surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption  that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)    The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the  development of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications  of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!    REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!     1   I dream like this: ether based reality     The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations  start as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices both drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it,  converting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy.  (non-spinning lattice = \\\"dark matter\\\")    The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image  of a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us  being stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by  the spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is  spinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner  kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a  faster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground  of the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but  its \\\"foot print\\\" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])      The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self  spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is  itself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the  wobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The \\\"orbit\\\" of the earth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged around by the sun's ether feild.    The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and \\\"distance\\\"  apart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because  the \\\"path\\\" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like  sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half  turn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has  got the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to  the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a \\\"j\\\" hook at  the end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the  whole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there.     With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon  can be about as big as \\\"earth's\\\" shadow upon it, and at other times  totally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge,  would you guess that they are about the same size, just because they  look about the same size?     O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S  E       /     \\\\                 M    |      |      OR                M              \\\\ _ _ /                                 S                                      The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate of ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating \\\"turntable view\\\"  of the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a  half moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the  day. Try and draw that \\\"earth shadow.\\\") Its only the moon's image  which appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is  the part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away  from the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.    \\\"Light-Years\\\" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is  closer to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase  of reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion.  (defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be  essentially happening now. The \\\"piece\\\" of light may have experienced  many years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.    To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to  de-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design  a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like  trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)    To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd  look in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just  might carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the  spectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+  billion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG  backwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card  for Pentium!)    Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound  media, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I  would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which  I'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole.  [Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a  two foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I  could get with my machine's receiver next to it.      If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT  PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of  life's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our  thoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By  eating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant  instructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or  biblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what  they did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we  don't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and  that is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where  did the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it  is programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then  die)    Warning about writing to the past: I had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel  future, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from.  There were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an  Oscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us,  and then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the  others into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by  \\\"advising\\\" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into  reproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that  the little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to  provide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it  in his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his  control. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying  that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve  souls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was  finite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in  our reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it  seemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then  some of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no  more, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped  through his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that  he had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body,  existing only on the wind.     MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls  whose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat  others as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a  lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for  playmates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back)    Accepting rides to the past: Once here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a  Prince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go  ahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry.  I Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes  your work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross  paths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own  course of history, none the wiser.    As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped  back in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still  make changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with  every 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which  loosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less.  But he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had  to apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand  to retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers.     How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country,  our money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this:  Washington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to  congress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks  are making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big  corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the  banks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but  mostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14  hours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time  to buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If  we are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if  the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets?     In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, \\\"its chaos!\\\" They  said, \\\"no, its order.\\\" He defined chaos as that which is he was not  able to control.    Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy  would hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no  language. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death) (think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and  pointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably  naive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should  be able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about.  They can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers  might have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a  different frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.    Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a  huge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat  only fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and  need a lot less sleep.    UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The  troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill  each other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)    Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot  tall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they  suck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that  they aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life.     Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women  and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut  from the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think  that there may be some very interesting results to this, such as  mother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples  of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.    That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He  tells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which  the people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll  play a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll  whine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to  live on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was  right, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go  back and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over  your destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality  in which you don't want to be a part of. \",\"Original to: szabo@techbook.com G'day szabo@techbook.com  29 Mar 93 07:28, szabo@techbook.com wrote to All:   sc> szabo@techbook.com (Nick Szabo), via Kralizec 3:713/602   sc> Here are some longer-term markets to consider:  Here are some more:  * Terrestrial illumination from orbiting mirrors.  * World enviroment and disaster monitering system.

The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they wanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.  Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining 6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks in the New Brunswick city.  The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if the season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold 1400 for this year.  SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL The Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of Saint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200 Exhibition Center.

The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks, announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates. There was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced a limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players including 2 goalies.

I sold that car quite a few years back but the memory of that tranny sticks with me.  It also had a clutch chatter in first that the dealer could not fix.  If the lemon law had been in place then, that car would have been covered.  I have had several Jap cars since then (figuring the Horizon was my contribution to the American Auto Companies), and have never seen any bad behavior with the exception of a Toyota Tercel with a bit of clutch chatter that they did fix on the first try.

[more nonsense deleted]   To knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious.  Your hockey education is not my responsibility.    He was just another player.  To laud him as anything more I find bothersome.  I hated the Habs.  I hated Lafleur until I realized that he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to ever  skate in my lifetime.  Why would anyone talk about Gainey?      Did he play hockey at a high level?  Was he any good?  If not, why would you bother to bring JC up?  I am talking about hockey players here.

BACKGROUND  ----------   The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions   devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad   interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism,   roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,  motosports enthusiasts.   The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little  over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from  New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada  Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.   The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need   to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of   performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise   ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.   Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to   issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \\\"flame-free\\\".

Since there has been some speculation on this news group about my own involvement in this project, I'd like to add that I was not in any way involved.  I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on Thursday evening, April 15.  Since then I have spent considerable time talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and I attended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16.   The document below is the result of that effort.   Dorothy Denning ---------------                       THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                 Dorothy Denning                                  April 19, 1993   INTRODUCTION  On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key.   CHIP STRUCTURE  The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is 16 Mbits a second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip   ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with the device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can be used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    The law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.   CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW  All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer information facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at Mikotronx.  At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a 64-bit block R1:          R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .  Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:            R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]          R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .  R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies.  As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips. After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind.   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2, and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies.  The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or both may be independent from the government.   LAW ENFORCEMENT USE  When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with Clipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the family key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take a warrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow agents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K. Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder operated by the FBI. \",\" True enough. I put it on the ground if it's free of spooge, or directly on my head otherwise.

Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot faster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is not unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective clothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong, you are likely to be less severely injured.  First thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course, this will get you started on the right foot -- they teach control of the vehicle and safe riding practices.  Second, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet and a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy  piece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking boots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine for this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay  tied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps are nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the pants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable, preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for a jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though more people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another thing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand leather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.  Third don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after  drinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement and balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditions are such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding in the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly,  brake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick, tired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or otherwise not in average shape.  With care, you should be ok.   I would suggest mid to late 80's japanese mid-sized standard. Something in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  If you are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as low as a 300-400 cc bike.  Possible models:  The Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally inline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to  weakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier  problems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650, it server me well.  The Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series I think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of standard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.  Kawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't know them as well.  For mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able to buy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective  clothing and insurance and licensing costs.\",\"I am looking at buying some Companion brand VLB/ISA/EISA motherboards with HINT chipsets.

Any information would be helpful!  thanks \",\"There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today's LA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I'd post it to stir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by saying that I largely agree that the \\\"Space Age\\\" in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \\\"What's New\\\" - the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of matter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I think, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \\\"mind children\\\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but I think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do *now*.     Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...   SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW  Micheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)  At 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis.  The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no longer define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion -dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards.    Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's science and technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy.    To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead.  .....  Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion to build space station Freedom alone.  Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains, Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken public champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much.  Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar space budgets.  Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.    ......  While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel Goldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's technological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been slashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions its competitiveness agenda.  ......\",\"I need to sell the following items:  an Apple IIe computer includes:   300 baud modem   80 columns   Zenith green monitor   tons of software and manuals  controller & I/O card   a Western Digital WDAT-440 includes:   Winchester controller   Floppy controller   2 serial ports   parallel port    No docs, but jumper settings are printed on the card.

Anthony Fauci, director of the  U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said,  \\\"We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly  can with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will  get around microbial resistance.\\\"  He said any delay would signify questions  over safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.  Fauci, who co- authored  one of the two papers published last week in Nature, rejects the   argument by one of his co-authors, Cecil Fox, that the new  discovery  indicates that \\\"$1 billion spent on vaccine trials\\\" has been \\\"a waste of time  and money\\\" because the trials were started  too long after the patients were  infected and were ended too  quickly.  John Tew of the Medical College of  Virginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument  for  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.

The OAM is a small division of  the NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10  billion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available  research grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be  available this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for  Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid  to become involved in AIDS.  \\\"They have to look successful and there is no  easy answer in AIDS,\\\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the  OAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening,  such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an  advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS  community was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists'  general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic  will be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \\\"The OAM advisory  panel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It   will take them several years to accept the nature of research.\\\"    Nevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator  at the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \\\"Here is a  wonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.

Lusso's   research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural  killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony  L. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube  findings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the  body.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor   molecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface  receptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that  herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV.       ======================================================================                                    April 15, 1993       ====================================================================     \\\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\\\" Journal of the  American Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert,  George and Nordenberg, Dale F.)        All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only  ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health  problems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert  and Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana,  Calif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,   respectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care  about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for  the concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should  be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it  is not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many   respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic  development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.   Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have  on many developing countries, and the increased need for international  assistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political  aggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there  is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach  to international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in  particular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \\\"Earth in the  Balance\\\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable  international development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child  survival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the  developing  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically   change the future of worldwide health.  ====================================================================    \\\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\\\" Journal of the American   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth)        Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible  before the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less  attention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller  Foundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and  Nordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as  malaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited   economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention  than they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is  receiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most  developing countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic  diseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another  year  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS  and its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden  but financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a  rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each  individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley  says he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and   economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he  concludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the  United States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries  with high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic   has been the rule.

The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90  children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV- infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease.   HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as \\\"a  hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected  children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.\\\"   Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and  Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial \\\"is  the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay  disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.\\\"  If these  vaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their  therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in  the United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health  Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide.   The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which  funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial  at nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the  ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human  Development.   Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows  that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  stimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers  know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease.   The results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined  closely for other reasons as well.  \\\"This trial will provide the first insight  into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\\\" said  Daniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  \\\"We need this  information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent  HIV infection in children.\\\"   In the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city  areas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic.   Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during  pregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than  a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing  numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection  drug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding  increase in the numbers of infected children.   HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.   The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV  develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These  infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of  childhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms  leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays.   At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger  to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older  participants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no  symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen  liver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune- regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study.   Study chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical  School, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of  Medicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical  officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS.   \\\"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children  for any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or  fevers, for example, than another,\\\" said Dr. McNamara.  \\\"We'll also look at  whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other  significant laboratory or clinical effects.\\\"   He emphasized that the small  study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  products.   The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from  recombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically  engineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well- tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults.   One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a  protein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.   Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is  the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug  Administration.   Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco  and the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in  Emeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus  adjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine  contains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in  other Phase I vaccine trials in adults.   A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15  children.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the  experimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone,  considered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will  be told what they receive.   If the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the  experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will  begin.   Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six  months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

They report that HIV itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling  skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV.  Although the  HIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals'  immunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV  itself caused the skin disease.   Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease  without affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the  National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues  described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human  Retroviruses.   Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most  animals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this  problem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for  HIV as well as their own genetic material.   NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse  eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters  contained both normal and transgenic animals.   Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV  genetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon  after birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an  incomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer.   Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their  necks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin  lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No  skin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates.   Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a  type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can  cause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the  animals.   Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the  presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.    HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \\\"turned  on,\\\" or active, said Dr. Kopp.   The scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the  mice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common  infections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune  systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the  skin lesions, Dr. Kopp said.   Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists  exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV  genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.   Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the  genes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No  lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light.   The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter  Dickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  Diseases.   Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs.  Nickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR;  Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney,  formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.

Shalala today announced the first nationwide  clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care  professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV  infection or AIDS.       The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a  physician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on  drugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is  funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of  San Francisco General Hospital.       Secretary Shalala said, \\\"One goal of this project is to share expertise  so patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health  care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces  treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and  community social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients  with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\\\"       Secretary Shalala said, \\\"This clinical expertise should be especially  helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in  communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\\\"       The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and  it is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST)  Monday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer  questions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and  health care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be  answered as quickly as possible.       Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question  related to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment  information, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral,  literature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health  care professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate  sources of information or materials.       When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken  by either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse  practitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and  inpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant  asks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current  medications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history.       This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  responded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern  California.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health  Professions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and  by the American Academy of Family Physicians.       \\\"When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of  care they are able to provide to their patients,\\\" said HRSA Administrator  Robert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  \\\"This project will be a great resource for  health care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve.\\\"       \\\"This service has opened a new means of communication between health care  professionals and experts on HIV care management,\\\" said HRSA's associate  administrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources  Development, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  \\\"Providers who treat people with  HIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment  methods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS.\\\"       HRSA is one of eight U.S. Public Health Service agencies within HHS.

You might be able to slip into a 500cc bike. Like I keep telling people, though, buy an older, cheaper bike and ride that for a while first...you might like a 500 Interceptor as an example\",\"  I'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated.  It appears that in a neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two home runs).  Or do they?  What is \\\"equivalent average?\\\"  One thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took away some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for doubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you expect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed,  hit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.     Felix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park. I would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player. Maybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.   I'd put him about there too.    Note: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he was always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so  at baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't winning.  Note 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a mistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group) with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).  We find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well. Their are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction; the lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent the player has left college ball, etc.  Now of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \\\"error.\\\"  Sometimes a player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star. Some hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe McDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are real reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows) involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting and so on.  But still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well. One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background of the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is that all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing ball.  Their backgrounds are similar.  What hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player with a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a Bo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so on, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard assumptions fit this person slowly?  It hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players. (It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after all, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton. \\\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\\\" they say.  Well, what happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean? It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than Tuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in Atlanta than Greenville.    Then again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank this year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's  worse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are  other players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties  again.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It's not. It's got some error.  Oh well.  Bill Guilford\",\"  So what should I carry if I want to comply with intelligent helmet laws?

Just in case: it is two strips of different metals bonded together, which  when heated bend to one side (check out the blinker globe in your  christmas tree lights).  So when you turn on the power, this causes the bulb to work like a neon,  heating up and shorting out, thus providing a loop to power the heaters in  the main tube. When the tube fires, insufficient current runs through the  starter to keep the heat up and the bi-metalic strip straightens out  (O/C).

The 27th was a short day at work, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided to go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes behind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24 Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the  car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit, and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and  her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to  45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help them. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?  When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was,  but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the  Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle around it. I ask, \\\"What's going on?\\\" Someone tells me, \\\"Come listen.\\\" Well they were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \\\"Brother Muslims, our time has come . . . \\\" and something else along that line. I didn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to  get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter.  New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And the comments started: \\\"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"There's no need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\\\" I even heard that: \\\"All  Moscow is behind us.\\\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this  was no joke. I quietly left and went home.  Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh,  that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of  things, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.  My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku.  I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and  shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly, like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a  demonstration and move slowly.  My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd people are shouting \\\"Down with the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"Death to the Armenians!\\\" I waited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street  on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned  and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26  Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there  was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same  kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside  from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.  My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of uneasy and said, \\\"No, let's stay at home instead.\\\" An hour went by, or maybe  an hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say exactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on the side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.  I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside, and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time  there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more  aggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration. They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run  again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I  followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was  leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one  side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square  and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There  was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals. I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \\\"We don't need  perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\\\" Now what did they  mean by \\\"living like we have been?\\\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else.  But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense  of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just  in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it  anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.  Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians'  apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't  hear them say \\\"kill them\\\" over the microphone, I only heard \\\"beat them and  drive them out.\\\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then another are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and  I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB. There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try  to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.  Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no demonstration, and I had to protect my family.  I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next to the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai- lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some- thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City  Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I  saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the  cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15  to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried  off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe  about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha.  When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was  about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He  has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I  have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of  people smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled  around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.  Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting.  I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am,  I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags.  And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the  street. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag,  which had \\\"Ermeni oryum\\\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \\\"Death to  Armenians!\\\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really know what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is Rafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark blue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His  family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on  Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars;  their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the  left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a  new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son  was carrying a flag that said \\\"Death to Armenians!\\\" I was surprised because  before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being  done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.  Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \\\"It's OK, it'll pass,  they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up.\\\" Naturally I didn't  want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And  this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't  see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't  handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking  and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and  hashish to put in a store window!  So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one  would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again,  the police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't  breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time.  True, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much- vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people  died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I  couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be  specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of  Sumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.  When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \\\"Let's go upstairs.\\\"  We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the  evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more. I stopped at \\\"The Corner,\\\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I  look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to  the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old.  The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed  toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person,  wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as  though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more  noise, and the glass was flying again.  We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor, there was really no way to defend yourself there.  In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town.  On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or  what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the  bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying  there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing you couldn't even see him.  That was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.

Caratzas, NY, pages 161-164  \",\" Amusing, isn't it?  Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is a *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.  Consider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom of the 13th.  Who won the game?  -Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs. -Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent  defensive plays behind him to do so. -Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and  got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of  the inning.  Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for the win.  How about the offense? -Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either  one, the Sox would have lost in nine. -Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single. -Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first  to third when... -Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning. -Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of  a help, but it was something. -Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the  way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)  Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were credited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit that set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as much as Richardson?  Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than runs.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the game-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with only one out!  Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  You can argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the clutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.  At least OBP and SLG don't *claim* to try to tell you that.

Entire population of the region was subjected  to genocide beyond belief; genocide which was planned to exterminate  the whole Turkish people of the region to the last man, woman and child.  Armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians. To  assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings  was one of their methods.

Thanks Paul.  --  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\",\" even a minivan based on viper running gear?\",\"  Very simple.  An 'Insurance Commissioner' is a bureaucrat - a regulator. It is his/her duties to make rules to enforce laws.  He/she cannot make laws.  If there is no law that covers a specific subject, say scam insurance companies, a regulator cannot create one.  So they have to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted.  For the California Insurance Commissioner, there are two possible legislative bodies:  the California State Legislature and the U.S. Congress.  We all know how little the California State Legislature accomplishes, esp.  along the lines of insurance reform legislation (negative movement).  So Garamendi wants the feds to do it, because: (a) he has a better chance of getting a federal law through, and (b) since many of the scam companies work across state lines/national borders, it is better to have a law that reach out into other jurisdictions.\",\"wing the suggestion of Stu Lynne, I have posted the Image File Format executable and source code to alt.sources.\",\" Would if only it were true ...

I noted that Protestants do not consider Sunday worship a law.  --clh]  He was not referring to the FAQ but to the five Sabbath Admissions posted on the bible study group.  This is what prompted someone to send the FAQ to me.  n> ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  You cannot show, from scripture, that the weekly Sabbath is part of the ceremonial laws.   Before you post a text in reply investigate its context.  Can the churches also decide what is and is not sin?  Interesting.  Where there is no divine imperative of course we must establish rules of operation.  But we cannot be as creative with what God has explicitly spoken on.  Darius\",\"Fascinating.  Most of the content of the White House announcements was in what was *not* said.  It gives us almost nothing of value, threatens to take away a lot, and does it with a sincere smile on its face, and the nice friendly word \\\"Management\\\".           FACT SHEET        PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT  The first thing it doesn't say is \\\"We're giving you stronger encryption\\\". what it says is     the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only    provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust    than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of    the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the    escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to    encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization. But DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now, so the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break! *At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they need to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search for the other 40-bit key.  Similarly, it didn't say \\\"We're making encryption is commercially available.\\\" because encryption *is* already commercially available, including forms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA. And phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were convinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.  The next thing it didn't say is \\\"We're making encryption legal\\\", because of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the President can't change the First Amendment merely by decree. What it *did* say was:  In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the  private sector from developing, or the government from approving,  other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in  assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system. which clearly means \\\"We're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys. Soon.  Once business buys into this.\\\"  Another thing it didn't say is \\\"We're going to ask Congress for money to do *lots* more wiretapping\\\", because of course, there's a budget crisis, and Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash. What it *did* say was:    The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to    the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct    lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure    law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General    shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture    Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase. which means \\\"We've got money Congress can't control and we're going to buy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON-APPROVED CRYPTO (that's what \\\"preserve the government's ability to conduct ... surveillance\\\"  means.)  \",\"* Attention voters: * * I had a problem with my mailbox on the first day of voting. * Please check the Vote Acknowlegement (ACK) at the end of this CFV. * If your name/address is not there, please send your vote again. * (Actually, check even if you voted after the first day)   Introduction:   This is the third (and final) Call For Votes (CFV) for the creation  of four OS/2 newsgroups and the renaming of one:  (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting     (unmoderated)  (b)  renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to       comp.os.os2.programmer.misc               (unmoderated)  (c)  comp.os.os2.setup                         (unmoderated)  (d)  comp.os.os2.multimedia                    (unmoderated)  (e)  comp.os.os2.bugs                          (unmoderated)   This is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting  and comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to  comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  The first attempt failed in the summer  of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules  state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started  after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).  This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and  comp.os.os2.bugs.   This document contains:  *  the background showing the need for these proposals  *  the proposed charters for these proposals  *  voting instructions  *  a voting ballot  *  some example ballots  *  the voting rules  *  the voting schedule  *  the Mass Acknowledgement   Background:   The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2  and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred  a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such  as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and  much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,  allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.   Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and  later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the  number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility  with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the  availability of drivers for their hardware, installation  procedures, etc.   Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows  Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is  including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version  2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).   Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,  especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.  So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks  (e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or  for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read  comp.os.os2.misc for details).   Proposed Charters:   (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so   as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and   spur additional development.  The group will also cover   topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,   Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program   portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and   so forth.   (b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)    To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy   orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to   comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup   for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and   technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.   (c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)    It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the   availability of device drivers, compatibility information,   installation procedures, system requirements, and overall   performance optimization.   (d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.   (e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug   diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system   patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.    [Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other   newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in   comp.os.os2.beta]   How to Vote:   To cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.  Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this  post.  Be sure to send only the ballot, and edit out the rest of  this post.   1)  Type in your vote for each proposal:       If you favor the charter as proposed, put a \\\"yes\\\" after its name.      If you oppose the charter as proposed, put a \\\"no\\\" after its name.      To abstain, leave a blank after its name.   2)  Type in your last name (i.e. your family name), a comma, and      your first name (i.e. your personal name).   3)  Cut out the ballot,  Please do not delete any lines of the      ballot.   4)  E-mail your ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu before 11:59:59 pm      (Central Time), April 24, 1993.   Ballot:  ----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----          (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting:         (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc:         (c)              comp.os.os2.setup:         (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:         (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs:          (f)       voter's last, first name:          e-mail ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu by April 24  ----cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------   Example Ballot #1:   (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes  (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes  (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: no  (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:  (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: no   (f)       voter's last, first name: Smith, John   In this example, John Smith favors comp.os.os2.programmer.porting  to be created, and comp.os.os2.programmer to be renamed to  comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  He also opposes the creation of  comp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view  on the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia.    Example Ballot #2:   (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes  (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes  (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes  (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes  (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes   (f)       voter's last, first name: Doe, Jane   In this example, Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all  the proposals.   Voting Rules:   * One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most    recent vote will be counted.   * Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,    forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.   * Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings    will be revealed only after the poll closes.   * I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will    post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).   * If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how    voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.    Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is    posted to news.answers on a regular basis.   * If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this    CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.   * When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal    passes if both of the following formulas are true:    1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes        by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).    2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the        number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).    In other words, a proposal passes if:        YES - NO >= max (100, NO)    where max() returns the highest number given to it.   Schedule:   The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted  by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).   This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the  Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who  have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you  have not voted yet, vote now!   The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on  April 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.  The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that  date.   Mass Acknowledgement:   Here is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots  as of 12:01 am (Central Time) on April 15, 1993:                            bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu Aiyagari,

What I would like is a mouse port with an interrupt of 10, 11, or 12 (which ever interrupt the PS/2 mouse port uses) in in ISA i486 computer.  I called technical support of Microsoft, Logitech, & ATI (checked what interrupts the mouse port on the ATI video cards can use) and they all said the only interrupts possible on these cards was ones lower than 7.  Does anyone know of any board for an ISA bus which will allow a mouse port (or even a serial port) with high interrupts?\",\"Julie, it is a really trying situation that you have described.  My brother was living with someone like that and things were almost as bad (although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due to other problems with the relationship).  Anyway, the best thing to do would be to get everyone in the same room together (optimally in a room with nothing breakable), lock the door behind you, throw the key out underneath the door (just as far as the longest hand can reach.  You would like to get out after the conclusion, I would imagine), and hash things out.  More than likely, there will be screaming, crying, and possibly hitting (unless of course someone decided to bring some rope to tie people down).  Some of the best strategies in keeping things calmer would include:    have each individual own their own statements (ie, I feel that this relationship is hurting everyone involved because.... or I really don't understand where you're coming from.)    reinforce statements by paraphrasing, etc. (ie, So you think that we did this because of...?  Well, let me just say that the reason for this was ....)    don't accuse each other (It was your fault that ... happened!)    find a common ground about SOMETHING (Lampshades really are decorational and functional at the same time.)    Guaranteed, in a situation like this, there is going to be some gunnysacking (re-hashing topics which were assumed resolved, but were truly not and someone feels someone else is to blame).  However, this should be kept to a minimum and simply ask for forgiveness or apologize about each situation WITHOUT holding a smoldering grudge.    The relationship really can work.  It's just a matter of keeping things smooth and even.  It's sort of like making a peace treaty between warring factions:  you can't give one side everything; there must be a compromise.  Breaks can be taken, but communication between everyone involved must continue if the relationships here are to survive.\",\" Another dodge.  Oh well.  I'm no match for your amazing repertoire of red herrings and smoke screens.    You asked for an apology.  I'm not going to apologize for pointing out that your straw-man argument was a straw-man argument.  Nor for saying that your list of \\\"bible contradictions\\\" shows such low standards of scholarship that it should be an embarrassment to anti-inerrantists, just as Josh McDowell should be an embarrassment to the fundies.  Nor for objecting various times to your taking quotes out of context.  Nor for pointing out that \\\"they do it too\\\" is not an excuse. Nor for calling your red herrings and smoke screens what they are.  I'm still not sure why you think I'm a hypocrite.  It's true that I haven't responded to any of Robert Weiss' articles, which may be due in part to the fact that I almost never read his articles.  But I have responded to both you and Frank DeCenso (a fundie/inerrantist.)  Both you and Frank have taken quotes out of context, and I've objected to both of you doing so.  I've criticized bad arguments both when they were yours and I agreed with the conclusion (that the Bible is not inerrant), and when they were Frank's and I disagreed with the conclusion.  I've criticized both you and Frank for evading questions, and for trying to \\\"explain me away\\\" without addressing the objections I raise (you by accusing me of being hypocritical and irrational, Frank by accusing me of being motivated by a desire to attack the Bible.) I don't see that any of this is hypocritical, nor do I apologize for it.  I do apologize, however, for having offended you in any other way.  Happy now?\",\"Concerning Christians praying for coporate forgiveness of national sins,  Michael Covington claims the following of C.S. Lewis:  <><  I was surprised when I heard this same kind of remark from a fellow grad.  student I know, especially since he had seminary training.  I have read the  same essay and do not find Lewis making any such claim.  Rather, Lewis is  condemning the use of such coporate prayer efforts as platforms to make  political jabs at opponents, feigned as confessions of guilt (ie., Lord please  forgive us for allowing \\\"insert political issue/idea/platform\\\" to exist in our country, it is wrong and we ask your forgiveness.).  I would be interested in knowing what part of the essay you feel condemns national repentance (please quote).\",\"  Yup, you said it.  I admire such honesty. ;-)   Fire an Anschutz .22, then come back and talk to us.  You're letting ignorance and possibly fear cloud your thinking.  Either that, or this is sour grapes because we beat you in the Olympic shooting events. Funny, you'd think biathalon would be a natural sport for the norse. ;-)   Precisely.  That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry. Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but for some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To extend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one (though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of training.  That makes firearms much better, in our eyes.   Excellent point.  Perhaps you aren't so naive after all?   Taken into consideration in what respect?  Though quite wrong, let's make it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has been taken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault, assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted murder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.   In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I'm curious, though, were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or were they aquired by other means?  Any requirements other than just registering the shotgun?   \\\"Come on down to honest Erik's Used Swords!  Here's a slightly-used short sword, *THE* battlefield supremacy weapon of the eleventh century!  Only $39.95 with trade-in.  Easy financing!\\\"  Sorry, I couldn't resist.  You guys still slicing each other with long knives, or is this really not a problem?   I'm all for that.  What gets me is that scandanavians (and yes, I'm only a couple generations off the longship) used to be some of the most feared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago, yet now seem to spend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing. Maybe you had a bit more time, and a more homogeneous culture, to become civilized with?   Yes.  We're too damned violent, partially I believe because we are not a homogeneous culture and don't identify ourselves as \\\"Americans\\\" first and foremost.  I'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage, whereas I suspect you couldn't care less about that 2% Welsh blood in your veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scale and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good. In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal liberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd hazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture we have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmother tells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke \\\"low Dane,\\\" whereas others spoke \\\"high Dane.\\\"  It was shortly after World War II, as I remember, that \\\"low Dane\\\" was abolished so there was one common dialect.  We cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem, because we have even more obvious means of identifying an \\\"outsider.\\\"   Take heart, yours is better than 90% of what gets posted by native speakers.

It is Armenian soldiers from mainland Armenia that are shelling towns in Azarbaijan. You might wish to read more about whether or not it is Azeri aggression only in that region.  It seems to me that the Armenians are better organized, have more success militarily and shell Azeri towns repeatedly.    I don't wish to get into the Cyprus discussion.  Turkey had the right to intervene, and it did.  Perhaps the intervention was not supposed to last for so long, but the constant refusal of the Greek governments both on the island and in Greece to deal with reality is also to be blamed for the ongoing standoff in the region.

Send me your offer at lohia@bharat.aux.apple.com\",\"     Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  This doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.    Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be, and isn't.     I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement.   First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ  could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the  male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.   Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.   Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism is an attractive option.   I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.) should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\",\"However, this has nothing to do with motorcycling, unless you consider the Amazona a bike.\",\"  Yes, I have!

It sounds like tonsilitis (lit. swollen tonsils).  Feel under your jaw hinge for a swelling on each side.  If you find them, its tonsilitis. I've had this a couple of times in the past.

If I only had to solve the problem for myself, and were willing to have to type in a second password (the secret key) whenever I logged in, it could work. However, I'm trying to create a solution that anyone can use, and which, once installed, is just as effortless to start up as the non-solution of just using xhost(1) to control access. I've got religeous problems with storing secret keys on multiuser computers.   Thanks for the pointer! It was good reading, and I liked the idea of using several unrelated sources with a strong mixing function. However, unless I missed something, the only source they suggested (aside from a hardware RNG) that seems available, and unguessable by an intruder, when a Unix is fresh-booted, is I/O buffers related to network traffic. I believe my solution basically uses that strategy, without requiring me to reach into the kernel.   I heard about this solution, and it sounded good. Then I heard that folks were experiencing times of 30-60 seconds to run this, on reasonably-configured workstations. I'm not willing to add that much delay to someone's login process. My approach (etherfind|compress, skip 10K) takes a second or two to run. I'm considering writing the be-all and end-all of solutions, that launches the MD5, and simultaneously tries to suck bits off the net, and if the net should be sitting __SO__ idle that it can't get 10K after compression before MD5 finishes, use the MD5. This way I could have guaranteed good bits, and a deterministic upper bound on login time, and still have the common case of login take only a couple of extra seconds.\",\" Lloyd Pettit.   Yes, it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the NHL for $50M; but at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much  less than that. He felt that no one would pay $50M for an expansion team, and that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that. But the market fooled him, and 5 teams have been created for $50M apiece in the last three years, and even the existing teams can't be moved for less than  $50M and I doubt that he could get one for that little.

Craig\",\" Aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide, so a product of its hydrolysis is going to be methanol, which can then be oxidized to formaldehyde.  The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise, since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time.  In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable. Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings, say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses the body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver. If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde, it is actually relatively non-toxic. \",\" The shell is waiting for the window-manager to respond to its positioning request.

And so, by their own choice, they will remain in darkness, sort of like bugs under a rock.  However, some people, but not many, will not like the darkness.  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable. These people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blinded at first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.  And, after a while, now that they can see things for what they really are, they will also see the heights which they can reach, and the places they can go, and they will learn to choose their own paths through the world, and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their successes.  They will see that there is much much more to the world than just the narrow experiences under the rock.  They will discover that life under a rock was incredibly yucky, and that life on their own terms is great -- so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it.  Do you see my point?

I went for a retailer, actually mail order (CDA computers), because its price was better thant the campus computer store. I found out why later on when I tried to get a repair done at an Apple registered repair center - the CPU was a resale. The serial number had been removed and replaced with a non-standard number (probably from CDA computers). Consequently, the Apple repair man could not do ANY warrenty repairs. So I ended up with just a 90day warrenty from CDA over the Apple 12month warrenty. Boy, was I pi**ed! Moral of the story, CAVEAT EMPTOR.  However, if you go with a reliable, trustworthy mail order firm (if they exist - maybe someone could enlighten us with their experiences), you will probably get a better price than your local educational outlet simply because mail order out of state does not REQUIRE sales tax yet.

I can't help but wonder what would happen if all violence against Israelis stopped.  Hopefully, violence against Arabs would stop at the same time.  If a state of non-violence could be  maintained, perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved, i.e., greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the \\\"territories\\\".    Of course, given the current leadership of Israel, your way may work also - but if that leadership changes, e.g., to someone with Ariel Sharon's mentality, then I would predict a considerable loss of life, i.e., no winners.

I've been seeing  her every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28)  and during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every  4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period.  As it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that  though I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she  mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13  weeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had  an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no  problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain  in my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very  difficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or  move unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for  when I do need to go out.)   Anyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from  the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about  2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.   (I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating  very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well  now I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile  related.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my  upper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I  was lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because  it started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt   no matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I  ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had  turned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if  I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it  wasn't as much of a problem.  So the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid  fatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware  of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have  been avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat  foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.    But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat  except fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts,  fried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I  should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only  have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day (  potatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in  a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or  steamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have  some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if  I'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it  from my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if  she's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her  recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on  cholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She  originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the  entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I  started.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and  she's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also  asked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them  are.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain,  and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did  want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be  temporary for that one week.   What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I  would understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying  that anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she  assumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that  because of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to  use the energy from the food I do eat.   Any opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm  truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet  because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few  minutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.

That's true. Game is so different here in Europe compared to NHL. North-ame- ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average european player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better  skater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL are mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league game is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many  breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in NHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates because of clumsy defensemen.  I have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regulars aren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues.

It would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft. The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to ten megatons yield behind a \\\"pusher plate\\\" attached to the main spacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer momentum to the ship.    Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion heats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave into the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are going to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton, helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic radiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission products).    Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once they're there.    I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?

The ethnic composition depends on what you mean by formed.  What the UN deeded to Israel?  What it won in war?     Were there anti-trust laws in place in mandatory Palestine? Since the answer is no, you're argument, while interestingly constructed, is irrelevant.  I will however, respond to a few points you assert in the course of talking about anti-trust laws.     And those fleeing Arab lands, where Jews were second class citizens.     Jews often paid far more than fair market value for the land they bought.    You know, Sam, when people start talking about an International Jewish conspiracy, its really begins to sound like anti-Semitic bull.   The reason there is no conspiracy here is quite simple. Zionists made no bones about what was going on.  There were conferences, publications, etc, all talking about creating a National home for the Jews.    [...]   Because you've never heard of it, its dead?  The fact is, you claimed Israel had to give arabs rights because of (non-existant) International aid.  Then you see that that argument has a hole you could drive a truck through, and again assert that Israel is only democratic within the (unexplained) constraints of one ethnic group. The problem with that argument is that Arabs are allowed to vote for whoever they please.  So, please tell me, Sam, what constraints are there on Israeli democracy that don't exist in other democratic states?   I've never heard anything about the Khazakistani arab population.  Does that mean that they have no history or roots?  When I was at Ben Gurion university in Israel, one of my neighbors was an Israeli arab.  He wasn't really all that different from my other neighbors.  Does that make him dead or oppressed?     How recent is recent?  I can probably build a case for a Jewish Gaza city.  It would be pretty silly, but I could do it.  I'm arguing not that Jerusalem is Jewish, but that land has no ethnicity.

I respond.       The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise      before entering into heaven. No one has made a point for or against       that issue, nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox      belief. The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom (Luke 16),       the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).       The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent      on their death bed. Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was      contradictory to what John's position put forward. The thief on the       cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise, the abode of       the righteous dead. John's position possibly needs to be reworked.      Kermit needs to address the topic at hand.\",\"======================================================================              NYC ACM/SIGGRAPH: UNDERSTANDING IMAGES ======================================================================    SUBJECT:      Pace University/SIGGRAPH Conference on UNDERSTANDING IMAGES     ===========================================================      The purpose of this conference is to bring together a breadth of     disciplines, including the physical, biological and computational     sciences, technology, art, psychology, philosophy, and education,     in order to define and discuss the issues essential to image     understanding within the computer graphics context.

Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,     music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing     complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well     defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far     exceed their technical skills.      The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression     tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and     virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the     observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of     simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar     representions, a confounded user asks: \\\"What does it all mean?\\\"      Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and     ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by     physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media     radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic     communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for     composing imagery for understanding.      Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a     breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the     physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,     psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and     discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the     computer graphics context.

Was the crucification the will of God or a tragic mistake.  I believe it was a tragic mistake.  God's will can never be accomplished through the disbelief of man.  Jesus came to this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He desperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah.  If the crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this cup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men and women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes. Is Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucification was NOT the will of GOD.  God's will was that the Jewish people accept Jesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on the earth with Jesus as it's head. (Just like the Jewish people expected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what kind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very different world.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.  Men and women of that age could have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was on the earth.  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would have continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to live with GOD.  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to wait for Christ's return.  But when he returns will he be recognized and will he find faith on this earth.  Isn't it about time for his return.  It's been almost 2000 years.  Mike    And the two simplest refutations are these:  (1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament. I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded \\\"impact\\\" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event.  (2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.\",\"Does anybody have informations about the   W 86 C 451   and  W 86 C 456 chips (40pin DIL pckg)?

If we are going to get anywhere in  this (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never  addressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is  \\\"right\\\" or who is \\\"wrong\\\", only that civilians ARE being used as cover  and that, having been placed \\\"in between\\\" the Israelis and the guerillas, they *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.    [The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms   is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that   civilians will not be thought of by the other side as  \\\"combatants\\\". So, what do you think is the \\\"meaning behind\\\",   the intention and the effect when an \\\"army\\\" purposely   *does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look   like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will   receive from this \\\"cover\\\" is more important that the harm  that will come to civilians.*  This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians in \\\"the middle\\\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians.   But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves  at greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \\\"why set   ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made   cover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of   view, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept   some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.   I agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND ineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait  until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that \\\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\\\" will do more to stop attacks.   As I said previously, Israel spent several decades \\\"sitting passively\\\" on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after* the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well. The \\\"host\\\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks  from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact  on the civilians caught in their path.    This is just another \\\"selectively applied\\\" statement.   The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your criteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.  That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for  the \\\"interim\\\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are demanding conditions that essentially define \\\"autonomy\\\" already. They DO NOT trust that Israel will \\\"follow through\\\" the entire process and allow Palestinians to reach full autonomy.   Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians?  If you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians  be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words? Since they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up \\\"tangible assets  (land, control of areas) in exchange for \\\"words\\\". For this reason, they are also concerned about the sorts of \\\"guarantees\\\" they will have  that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.  Absolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the Israelis \\\"word\\\" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being demanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party finally gets HOLD of this \\\"land\\\", what the \\\"other party\\\" does is totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land, your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to keeps its word does NOT get the land back.   While the \\\"major armaments\\\" (those allowing people to wage \\\"civil wars\\\") have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still remain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and \\\"commando\\\" raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.   Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks were commonplace.   There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively \\\"disarmed\\\" UNLESS the state is as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially mirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.  That's what I said, ok? But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to \\\"take over\\\" Lebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that. What both \\\"sides\\\" need is to receive something \\\"tangible\\\". The Arabs/ Palestinians are looking for \\\"land\\\" and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it gives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHEN it gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks\",\"I just read articals on this in Road and Track and Car and Driver  (Is that one mag or two? =B^), and I was wondering if people out  there have any opinions that differed from what these mags have to  say...

I've looked in the FAQ and the O-Reilly books and was unable to find (an easy) means of finding out the state of state keys such as CapsLock and NumLock.  I can certainly track the events inside of my window and set a boolean there, but what if CapsLock is pressed in another window?

I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, I have other xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning.  In case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles, here's a crude picture:   ====================== Figure 1 ====================================  |  |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+  |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C +  |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+  |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C, but +  |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  +  |    +      window, window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     +  |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+  |  ====================== Figure 1 ====================================  Squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack, with easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really need, since I also insist on having a virtual WM.  The only problem is that the title location is static, that is,  it is configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and time-consuming.  Therefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right } functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click of a button, you can change this:      +---------+     + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+  to this:                     +---------+                    + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+   ===============  Okay.

One way would be to post, in comp.windows.x, a description of this enhancement, together with an explanation of why I think it is a Very Good Thing, and hope that someone reads it. :-)  In case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing, look back up at Figure 1, and picture window A moved over on top of windows B and C; now window A's title hides Window B's title; but when you hit f.squeezecenter, the result is:          +=========+   +---------+   +=========+         + title B +   + title A +   + title C +         +-------------------------------------+         +   this is the body of the window,   +         +   window A, which is on top.        +         +-------------------------------------+   ===================  The rest of this posting explains how to implement it, based on my X11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the full diffs would be too long.  The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the ExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c:  #ifdef SHAPE  case F_SQUEEZELEFT:  { static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT, 0, 0 };   if (DeferExecution (context, func, Scr->SelectCursor))     return TRUE;    tmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze;   SetFrameShape( tmp_win );   break;  }  .... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and  squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ... #endif  ( Of course, you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h   and add     { \\\"f.squeezeleft\\\", FKEYWORD, F_SQUEEZELEFT },      ... and so forth ... to parse.c  In order to use these functions, add something like the following to your .twmrc file:  Button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter   =================  About a year ago, I posted this, but our news was broken and I *think* it didn't get out.

Anybody knows compression-algorithms & -factors for voice ?  I've posted some info on CELP coding on sci.crypt.  Looks like you can squeeze speech into 4000bps if you have a fast enough computer like a sparcstation (or a Newton with the Acorn Risc Machine in it :-) )  This drops the bandwidth to so low a figure that it's feasible to run speech over tcp/ip running on top of slip down a v32bis modem.  Not only will this let us run point to point encrypted speech, it'll let us run speech internationally over the internet if no-one stops us by getting *very* heavy about regulations.  The thought of this, if the administration realised, would probably scare them shitless.  Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol for internet speech *damn fast*, allowing anyone who feels brave to inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our workstations.  Shouldn't be too difficult.  The CELP stuff is standardised, we use tcp/ip streams, and a protocol allowing silences to be used to catch up on any net lag, and also to avoid sending any data during silences (ie it's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each end because any net delays would add up to big voice-lags)  As for me, I'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as I get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone. It'll save me a fortune in calling my friend in texas every night :) (whether encrypted or not)  You know, surely *someone* is working on this.  Who?  It's so obvious, why doesn't it exist already?

I want to use any read-only cells that are already in my colormap once I start running out of allocatable cells, using some arbitrary nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to a requested color.  Once I determine if a cell is read-only, I assume I can then just request an XAllocColor() with the exact same color specifications and it will  then be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it doesn't later get freed by someone else and allocated again as read-write to another application.  So far, the only way I've figured out to do this is to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors, once my colormap is all full up.  It should error out if the cell is non-shareable. But life would be much easier if I could just detect the read-only/shareable stuff directly...  Any ideas?\",\"Help!

First, note that the \\\"experts\\\" will only look at \\\"details\\\", and of just  the algorithm:      In addition, respected experts from outside the     government will be offered access to the confidential details of     the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report     their findings.  Why not the chip design?  Well, here's the possiblity:  in addition to encryption, the chip pre-processes voice signals to make them easier to analyze/transcribe electronically.  The chip, once widespread, might effectively be part of a massively parallel computer for \\\"voice- grepping\\\" the US phone network (or the criminal & wrong-thinking patrons thereof).  I wouldn't put it past the NSA.  Think how much easier it would make life for them.  And if this is indeed the case, think of the possible public outcry should it become widely known.  Thus the secrecy.  It might be a good idea to have experts in DSP, voice recognition, and AI conversation-understanding to be on that panel, and insist they be given (authenticatable) design specs and implementation documentation.\",\"    So I should be very comfortable that 500,000,000 people want to convert me to Islam.

His equivalent average started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. So let us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 level of play.  That is good. Very good, in fact.

As much as some people accept their Church, their priests or straight from their own scriptures as the \\\"proof\\\", this does not  satisfy atheists.  Atheists DO believe in recognisable authorities.  If they were as dogmatic as you claim they are, they would be trying to prove 1 + 1 =2 every time they got up.  What they dispute is that Churches, priests, scriptures etc. represent true authorities and know the TRUTH.   Are you asking us to believe blindly?

I am a divorced father. Chance would have it that \\\"my weekend\\\" with my  daughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.  Although I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decided that the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith was too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a date), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.  During the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church.   When our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she  be baptised as Catholic. This wasn't a problem with me.  During a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease that affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward for two months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated \\\"effectively\\\".  In other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.  During the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over my daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday visitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study books to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.  Last fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings. At that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time, I started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend. I did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a religious community.  Today, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for  Communion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine (The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the pew in front of us.  I feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her religious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments if you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.  My daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and mature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly for religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with my daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.  My initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith in Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays with her again.  I do not want to \\\"drive her from the fold\\\", and would be willing to allow her to continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only for two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.

I've been thinking about this, and if this chip/scheme is to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange, either using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme like Diffie-Hellman.  If there's an out-of-band transmission of a shared session key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping?  If the phone company or some other online central authority generates a session key and sends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble of having some complicated key-depositories?  Just ask the phone company for a copy of the session key for each call.      Now, it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of every public key used by anyone anywhere, right?  So, probably, there will be some way of getting these keys verified.  This might be a digitally- signed (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit, stored by this unit.  It might also be an online directory with access to everyone's public keys.  (This would introduce another weakness to the security of the scheme, of course.)  Presumably, if you don't use your designated key, you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips.      It might be useful to have a modified chip, which would allow you to use either the original public/private key pair, or some other key pair and verification scheme.

I think our two definitions can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven't attempted to define the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of each Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a similar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is easy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I misunderstood?   My p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and his writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do my bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth) is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this will probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the list of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element may come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his transactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.  I've had some more thoughts on my definitions:  I've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of the Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a graphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of frequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the spectrum over time.  Conscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature because Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often unwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given time which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with Freud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the urges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego, I suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is \\\"what provides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?\\\". I think I need some more time with this one.  That's about it for now!

Presumably, he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about MSG making people ill.   Similarly, debunking such claims without doing research (whether literature and lab), is equally beside the point. The original poster no doubt already knows that some people think 'Chinese Restaurant Syndrome' is bogus.  Placebos are all very interesting, but irrelevant to the question of what effects MSG has. You could have real effects *and* placebo effects; people may have allergies in addition.    Have you read Olney's work? I fail to see how citing results from peer-reviewed studies qualifies as \\\"bizarrely cracked\\\".   Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys, as well. I have never seen a study where the mode of administration was intra-ventricular.  The Glu and Asp were administered orally. Some studies used IV and SC. Intra-ventricular is not a normal admin. method for food tox. studies, for obvious reasons. You must not have read the peer-reviewed works that I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain injection bunk.   Pardon me, but where are you getting this from? Have you read the journals? Have you done a thorough literature search?  But, you're right, mice aren't the best to study this on. They're four times less sensitive than humans to MSG.   The point is exceeding the window. Of course, they're amino acids. Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine.  Olney's research compared infant human diets. Specifically, the amount of freely available Glu in mother's milk versus commercial baby foods, vs. typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged soup mixes. He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin for infant humans by at least four-fold in a single meal of processed foods. Mother's milk was well below the effective dose.    Between who? Over what? I would be most interested in seeing you provide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citations to articles disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever.

The numbers comparing hundreds of thousands (indeed, even a million) of instances of law abiding citizens deterring criminal activity, seem valid to me.  Likewise the number of gun-caused homicides each year (about 11,000/year?).  However, it is surprising that the \\\"Evil AntiGun Empire \\\" (Darth Vader breathing sound effect here) never tries to compare \\\"All legitimate gun defenses\\\" vs. \\\"All gun crimes.\\\"  Instead,  it's always \\\"All legitimate gun defenses,\\\"  which includes cases in which the criminals are shot but not killed, and cases in which the criminal is not here, vs. just  criminal gun homicides, which only includes case sin which the victim died.  Why is this?  Of course, it wouldn't be unreasonable to say that in each crime already measured (involving guns), the consequnces are already known and it is safe to assume that a gun-based bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn into a gun-basd robbery+homicide.  Whereas in the legitimate gun defenses, one may assume that all those criminals who were deterred would have committed more crime or more serious crimes had they not been deterred.  -Case Kim\",\" i've been using an identical setup, except for the tower config, for several months now.  from previous discussions on the net, the first thing to check for is DMA conflicts with other devices, especically if you've got any funky ones.  next off, suspect your tape - try a fresh one.  good luck !\",\"   I agree, we spend too much energy on the nonexistance of God.  --          \\\"Satan and the Angels do not have freewill.

This morning about 6:00, the feds punched holes in the compound walls by using a tank.  They  then started using non-lethal tear gas.  Shortly after noon, 2 cult members were seen setting fire to the compound.  So far, about 20-30 people have been seen outside the compound.  The fate of the other 60 or 70 people is unknown, neither is the fate of the 17 children that were inside.  The compound did burn to the ground.  Koresh, who at times has claimed to be the Messiah, but then backed off and only claimed to be a prophet, had promised several times to come out peacefully if his demands were met.  First, he demanded that his message be broadcast on the radio, which it was, but he didn't come out. He claimed to be waiting for a message from God.  Finally, he said that God told him that he needed to decipher the mystery of the 7 seals in Revelation, and when he was finished, he'd come out.  He finished the first one, but didn't do any more work that anyone knows of since then. The federal agents did warn him that if they didn't come out, they  would be subjected to tear gas.  I think it's really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere man, even if he did claim to be the son of God, and/or a prophet.  I think it underscores the importance of putting you faith only in things that are eternal and knowing for yourself what the Scriptures say and what they mean, instead of relying on others to do it for you, even if those others are learned and mean well.\",\"I got a number of requests for code.

You are much more likely to do some good writing to local newspapers, and broadcast news shows.  If you do, keep the letter short and to the point so they don't discard it out of hand, and emphasize exactly what you are upset about.  It's possible that the local health department can help you complain to  someone official, but really, that 'clinic' exists for the sole purpose  of generating walk-in income through advertising, and *nothing* you can do  will change them -- all you can hope for is to help someone else avoid them.

It *may* be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is, through trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology. Only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one improve on that technique (I hold that this applies to any human endeavor).   Do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd? Are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or decrease available traction?  Braking?  It is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum swerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques.  For most of his riding life this may not be a problem, but in an emergency situation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage.   I disagree.  The existance and immense success of riding courses which teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner that is neither confusing, nor detracts from any other aspects of the course.   Perhaps, but in the ensuing discussion, you strayed far from that point, to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a rider's ability.  I find this assertion ludicrous. \",\"   | You certainly do not see OTC preparations advertised as such.  | The only such ridiculous concoctions are nostrums for premenstrual  | syndrome, ostensibly to treat headache and \\\"bloating\\\" simultaneously.  | They're worthless.    | That's not the idea, and no, they don't work.

Thanks\",\"The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to death, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.  Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt, reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.  Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch.  That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game, Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about  winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch.  Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any  that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible.  Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games.  I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play, he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.  But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan.    -- The Beastmaster   \",\"  OK.  I stand corrected.

Your boss should be the person bring these problems to.  If he/she does not seem to take any action, keep going up higher and higher. Sexual harrassment does not need to be tolerated, and it can be an enormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that they are trying to do something about it.  If you feel you can not discuss this with your boss, perhaps your company has a personnel department that can work for you while preserving your privacy.  Most companies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety does seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs.  It is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not.  It is not inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee problems/strife even after eight years (it's a miracle if they do notice).  Perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of higher ups?  If the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the entire problem, there may be a state agency willing to fight with you.  (check with a lawyer, a women's resource center, etc to find out)  You may also want to discuss this with your paster, priest, husband, etc.  That is, someone you know will not be judgemental and that is supportive, comforting, etc.  This will bring a lot of healing.

People in offices tend to be more insensitive while working than they normally are (maybe it's the hustle or stress or...)

The last time I got stung by a bee I experienced the same reaction the first poster's brother did.  We went off to the doctor to see if I should worry about the fact that my foot was now about 3 times it's normal size.  (And itched!!!  Ow!)  He basically said I shouldn't this time, but that bee sting allergy was not something you tended to get aclimatized to, but were something that each time got progressively worse generally and that next time could be the time I go into anaphylactic shock.  Admittedly this was many years ago when I was young.  Since then I just make sure I don't get stung.  I also should carry a bee sting kit with me, but I don't.    This isn't scientific or proof, but this would lead me to believe it's not a different reaction, just a different degree of reaction.  Allergies work that way.  People have various reactions.  Sort of like diabetes, some people can get by with just monitoring their diet, others have to monitor their diet and use insulin sometimes while others have to watch their diet like a hawk and use insulin regularly.    I think MSG is probably similar...some people have allergic reactions to it.  Some people are allergic to fermented things and can't use soy sauce...but the chinese have been using it for centuries... that doesn't necessarily mean that it's safe for everyone.  \",\"If the Islanders beat the Devils tonight, they would finish with identical records.

I  would *not* feel threatened by those only accepting or pursuing  \\\"Islamicization\\\" through peaceful means, nor by Jews advocating the same approach.

If I am a member of a non-muslim minority *inside* the Islamic world and *actively did not* accept my \\\"minority\\\" status, I *would also  certainly* see Islam's domination as having been acheived, and maintained,  through the powerful coercive force all majorities wield over minorities within their ranks.

It needn't have been true.  If every pitcher in baseball were essentially the same in quality (i.e. if the variance of pitching ability were much smaller than the variance of batting ability), then scoring runs would be much more important than preventing them, simply because the *ability* to actively prevent runs would be much weaker.   If that's your point, you should have said so.  What you in fact said was \\\"Pitching and defense win championships\\\", and later \\\"Pitching is the essence of baseball\\\".  Neither of which says what you are now claiming was \\\"your  point\\\", and neither of which is true.   And you accuse Sherri of mouthing cliches!?   It's not clear to me at all that this is true.  In high-scoring games, the team with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time.  In low- scoring games, the split is essentially 50/50 regardless of team ability.

They still arm themselves to \\\"defend the #>faith\\\", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite a #>lot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wives #>for the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their #>sect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking. #                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^  By \\\"they,\\\" you mean the leaders of the lds church?  I grant you that when Joseph Smith was still alive, plenty of \\\"accusations\\\" were filed, most of which had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts. I have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove that the lds leadership was involved, in quote: \\\"illegal activities.\\\" Plural marriage, yes, but your charge of \\\"underage\\\" wives sounds like it could have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral standards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it appears, those of David Koresh.  #        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram #were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over #who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like #Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider #Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Make #no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  The  And neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral aptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \\\"crime\\\" was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried to explain the \\\"Smith phenomenon\\\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5 million member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith's testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.  #thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed #down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only #entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have #been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The #Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much help #here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects. #Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited #for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other #claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)  \\\"The rest\\\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church, while the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various auxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new prophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and doctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in line to fill the prophet Joseph Smith's vacancy: he was the senior apostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated that it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.  Other rightful \\\"heirs\\\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated (Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified, Joseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty land beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This \\\"Rekhabite\\\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated by the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.  Granted, a couple of \\\"do-it-yourselfers\\\" stayed behind, unwilling to sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but this also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The church benefitted from this purification process: they became even more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.  #        Both sects practiced the \\\"1-year food stockpile\\\" doctrine, #and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at #least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a #militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than #face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a #great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite #justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember, #this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people #had nobody to turn to save themselves. # #        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.  BTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of the largest denominations in the country) a \\\"sect\\\"???  It didn't \\\"splinter\\\" from any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.  #>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J.

Preposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I am convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes of honor and conduct (that's why they were selected for in the first place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith STRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all people are free to worship \\\"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\\\"  #        If it's true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS #philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true #Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his #own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may #as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You #can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected #it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to #Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they #will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover #liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade #alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like. #These people are the \\\"salt of the Earth\\\" and as such are more #easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.  A good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds people are sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon's \\\"orders\\\" (the late president Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong opposition of the selection of the MX \\\"Peace Keeper\\\" missile maze in Utah).  #        That's my somewhat educated guess, anyway.

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they would call Japan, etc.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not like memory is that expensive any more.

The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Still rather low overall, but significant.

Jorgenson did nothing exceptional that I noticed.  Leius missed a ball I *think* Gagne would have reached; we will certainly miss Gag's glove this season.  He looked pretty good there.

Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations to Close Naval, Marine Reserve Centers  To: National Desk, Defense Writer  Contact: Herbert M. Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of           the United States, 202-479-2258     WASHINGTON, April 13 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Reserve Officers Association of the United States has alerted the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to give sufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers.    In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members of Congress with affected locations in their constituencies, including Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine list ignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior service personnel.    ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.), suggested \\\"concern that the only plausible alternative is that they are intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve components from maintaining even today's relatively low level of participation in their parent service's Total Force of the future.\\\"    He asked the commission \\\"to remove from consideration all locations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to warrant approval of the requested action.\\\"    \\\"Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve installations on this list are large enough to have a significant impact on the community, if closed,\\\" wrote Hultman.  \\\"The major issue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large percentage of the existing locations.\\\"    Hultman reminded the commission, \\\"The fact that the vast majority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come close to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this process certainly supports the thesis\\\" that these actions are simply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve.    ROA also noted \\\"that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of Naval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480 Naval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations are approved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities.\\\"    Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging from South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 Naval Reserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., to Missoula and Great Falls. Mont.  Naval/Marine Corps Reserve Centers include four in San Francisco, Fort Wayne, Ind., Billings, Mont., and Abilene, Texas.    A major Marine Reserve Center on the list is that at El Toro, Calif., plus six others.  -30-\",\" There is a (likely) veto proof majority in the house.

Because, the unspeakable crimes of the Armenians must  be righted. Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of  Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population and presented to  the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian civilization.  All reliable Western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly people of  Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the  Ottoman Empire between 1914-1920.  It is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators of the Nazis during World War II and that, even today, criminal/Nazi members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate racism, hatred, violence and terrorism among peoples.   And x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following  ways:  1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility.  2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism  Triangle and criminal/Nazi Armenians, attempts to call into question the  veracity of the Turkish Genocide.  3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to  silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.  4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.  Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian government  is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.  Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle  of those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and  consequently a number of governments and organizations have become  supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.

It's my choice, either way.  I am my own master.  I choose what I want to do.  I weigh the benefits of my actions against their consequences, and I use my experience to help me deal with the unexpected, which in turn make me more experienced.

You play the skee-ball over and over because you'd like to get better at it, even though you're not going to win anything better than a stuffed animal even if you blow ten dollars on it.  You ride the roller coaster because it's an thrilling experience, even though (because?) it scares the dickens out of you.  In the same way, I think life is fun.

I still believe that doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I would not have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent the many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done. And 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that  would help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank goodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine that helps me.    I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That you would go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second opinion, and then move on with your life. Just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in  this field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses. These are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over the country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going to a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was  helpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very unproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research, make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.  A recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of what I'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's not a put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors are only human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.  I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things that is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart, or failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That's because  those things are much more tangible and have much more concise  definitions and treatments.

A family sedan designed to be operable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph because you added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much larger engine.  That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine.  They didn't even bother improving the *brakes.*  The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power plant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications. I have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a brick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something I personally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is inadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of the car is not up to par.  I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind.  It didn't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much cheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these cars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.  There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought it up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe the following to be true:  1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here. 2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than    they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them    far more predictable than most US highways. 3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have    speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in    the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not    much higher than 120km/h.  I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph (nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.  Some people have no respect for their own lives.

I believe I discussed countersteering a horse before.  Basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins under his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit (which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).

What kind of memory is stable/reliable enough, non-volatile enough and independent enough (of outside battery power) to last say, 10 years or more, in the life of a vehicle?  I'm amazed that anything like this could be expected to work for this length of time (especially in light of all the gizmos I work with that are doing good to work for 2 months without breaking down somehow).  Side question:  how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with a replaced odometer that starts over at 0 miles, after say 100/200/300K actual miles.  Looks like fraud would be fairly easy - for the price of a new odometer, you can say it has however many miles you want to tell the buyer it has.  Thanks for any insight.

plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have working code, which I will also include.  The intersection of 3 planes method looks best, but my implementation based on a short article in  Graphics Gems I doesn't work.  I may be misinterpreting, of course.  I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better.  In either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solution of linear equations).  To get the planes, I was taking the midpoint of the line from, say, P1 to P2, and setting the normal as the \\\"normalized\\\" vector from P1 to P2. These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.  HOwever, the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points (for different tests).  My matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks like I need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, which will require bringing in another routine I don't have (but should be easy to find).  Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets of 3 points, and intersecting the normals from there.  This would also define the circle center.  However, small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not intersect.  Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a unique point if they are not parallel.

After a large response (about 15 email messages), I've decided that there is sufficient interest here on t.p.g. to warrant posting.  *** file follows ***   Hi Folks;  As perhaps the only Boise resident on the list, I guess it kind of falls on me to keep people updated about the Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial.  Yesterday marked the seating of the jury.  Apparently no other legal activities occurred.  The jury was selected and things start today.  More interesting is what happenned outside.  About a dozen Weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the courthouse.  One woman carried a sign that read, \\\"Who stands trial for the murder of Vicki and (son's name - I forget) Weaver?\\\"  On the evening news she said, \\\"I am here protesting because I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion. I thought we all did.\\\"  Nice sound bite (grin)!  The news reporter also interviewed some guy named \\\"Tim\\\" who refused to give his last name.  Not to prejudge the guy, but he looked like a neo-nazi.  He also said he expected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial. \\\"Tim\\\" had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaver and Harris and the news had footage of a Boise cop telling him to move along or he'd arrest.  I don't know the finer points of this one.  Perhaps there's a law against political activity within X feet of a courthouse or something (what happenned to the First Amendment?!?).

I have written this reply in the most even-handed manner that I can, with no emotions boiling to the surface as it was written.  Please accept this as a serious attempt to foster dialog and rest assurred that I make every attempt to make fun of no one, except myself ;-)]    [...]    Hmmm.  There are other animals on this planet with advanced  mental facilities which have not developed \\\"religion\\\" as a  satisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?   Further, it appears that only humans have a \\\"need\\\" to explain the  unexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet,  including those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly  content in their ignorance.   I'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me  from your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal  *only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need  not be researched; 3) religion was \\\"made up\\\" by humans to address a  perceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that  is, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical  structure with biology at the apex).   Needless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the  underlying presuppositions.    I disagree that Christianity is \\\"an infectious cult\\\".  It has  certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in  spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.  That it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is  \\\"infectious\\\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides  a workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this  is the case).   I disagree that Christianity is \\\"a safety blanket\\\" which supplants  hope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one  Source of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a  Christian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to  you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose  and externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of  control over one's own life the problem or is it something else?   Finally, one does not appropriate \\\"eternal happiness\\\" by following  Christian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance  of Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people  from their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the  Christian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian  in the Person of God's Spirit.   Heaven is one of two final states that  Christian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally  not motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this  promised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived  benefits to them in the here-and-now.    Many Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a  priority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this  as a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate  priority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,  convert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).  Rather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting  the opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits  of a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful  that it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask  \\\"Why?\\\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-  plished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it  does not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian  is required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of  friendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot  evaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or  harm others if the sole purpose of being a \\\"friend\\\" is to gain a  conversion).   As a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-  ticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \\\"hurry-up\\\"  attitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no  conversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was  coerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open  to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).  The Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings  conviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part  (witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.    We are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die  just as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more  than this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is  so limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find  a more expansive view.   (For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing  arts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language  of other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?  How is it that humans can organize themselves in various social  structures whereas other animals have only one structure?)    Blatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.  Christianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not  a *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship  with a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-  knit relationship with this appelation.    There are \\\"Jesus freaks\\\" who let the emotional aspects of worship  and Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,  this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these  things flow.    Guilty by association?  That \\\"christianity\\\" which forces itself  upon another is not Christianity at all.    You appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened  2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?   I cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus' influence was a sole  result of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years  gone by this time.  It strains the bounds of credulity to assert  that nothing about Jesus' life was noteworthy _until_ the sack.    Christianity is having a relationship with Jesus Christ Himself.  What do you know of Him? \",\"After having OpenWindows  (Version 3 for SunOS 4.1) or Xwindows running continuously on my machine for 3-4 days, the following message appears  when trying to open a new window, or to run any program that needs to open windows.

It may not use the exact words as quoted above but I'm sure many will agree that the same message is being issued.  Later on when I get back home I will try to find the precise section(s) but you can do the research for now (I hope).  I also realize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_ *to the Western media only* but he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact intentions on this issue.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_ still stands as the \\\"Bible\\\" (so to speak) of the mainstream Palestinian National movement!    As a staunch pro-Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT influenced my opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As I mentioned above, just a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar conclusion on the Palestinian National movement (the PLO in most cases).  BB does not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share my views.   What 1948 situation?  A negative situation I presume?  Is this the same \\\"situation\\\" when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the Jews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM?  Was this an example of Qu'ranic law being exercised?  If not, I have another suggested reading for you... get into the \\\"soc.culture.arabic\\\" newsgroup where the posters have been debating the topic \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" (and may I remind you the people doing the debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran). You will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran (to put it lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will be treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran?  I think the 1948-1967 \\\"situation\\\" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you think?   All I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" and think again.  \\\"Freedom of choice\\\" is *definitely* not an option in Qu'ranic law especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I'm sure you saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic state).   Probably nothing!  Aside from how to break the news to his Palestinian brethren that the _Covenant_ is \\\"null and void\\\" without getting assassinated himself!   In conclusion, Ahmed, you should go to the library and find the _Palestinian National Covenant (1964)_ and read it VERY CAREFULLY.  By the way, Redpath Library DOES have it in stock because that is exactly where I found it when I was doing my research.

It would relieve the various states of the thorny problem of what to do with the hundreds of millions of dollars hunters pour into the economy annually.

To do less than this would place these same groups/individuals in the ethically untenable (to say nothing of environmentally and politically incorrect) position of sanctioning the logging and subsequent development and urbanization of these former private hunting lands, which would no longer be useable by, or of any benefit to, the landowner(s) in such a capacity.\",\" It's supposedly a high-performance chip based upon workstation graphics accelerators.

To paraphrase Sartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing.  Your logic comes to fruition in relativism.    Ah, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in contemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus ('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of language he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's thought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary framework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features remain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own account, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to talking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but a threshold.   vonWrights's comment that Witt's \\\"sentences have a content that often lies deep beneath the surface of language.\\\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing ourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with Witt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes in our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more perspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it is already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man.  Perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.    This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in it conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of understanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \\\"as a man thinketh, so he is.\\\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside, that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals of truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that there is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too are knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the individual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to Christianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the Spirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has the capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not only has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things of God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep things of GOd that are absolute and true.    There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced and it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.    \\\"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would say unto me.\\\"  Job 23ff  --Rex\",\" The Dividians didn't have that option after the FBI cut off their electricity. \",\"}Honda:  a \\\"V\\\" designates a V engine street bike. \\\"VF\\\" for V-4, \\\"VT\\\" for V-twin.

Write yourself a minimal \\\"file system\\\" program that is used to create/delete files, en/decrypt them to ramdisk, list a directory. Put the util, password protected, on a floppy.     The catch is that the storage space used by this util is NOT part of the DOS file system.  Instead, defrag your disk, thus packing all allocated clusters into clusters 0-n.  Then use the back end of the partition to hold your 'stealth' file system.  Or, leave a small 2nd partition on the disk that is not assigned to DOS.  Another approach might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files (DOS system files, for instance).  Due to DOS allocating a minimum storage  unit of a \\\"cluster\\\" there is unused physical space on the disk between the tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster. These dead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth file system.

It's called drum.zip.    I have an ATI Stereo FX card with the latest Windows drivers installed.

Wouldn't it just make more sense to find some way to cut down on the cost of malpractice insurance?  And maybe that's not such a good thing. I also read somewhere that it is next to impossible in Canada to litigate against the health system-class action suits are nearly impossible, and you can't sue the provincial health officials at all.   Oh no. Don't let the AMA know about this. They have enough power as it is. Ask most Americans whether they'd like the doctors' lobby to get more powerful.   Well, yeah, tell us about the National Defense Medical Centre outside Ottawa. Theoretically it's limited to service personnel, but some studies I've heard about have suggested that about half the patients there are civilians who not only have connections but aren't \\\"urgent\\\" at all.  The problem is, in a system where hospitals' annual budgets are approved by the government, how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions? I bet that if you're an MP or MPP, or good friends with one, you're put on any hospital's \\\"urgent\\\" care list no matter how minor your problem. Which is OK  unless you're someone who gets bumped off the list for some bigshot.   Hmm. How much difference would it make in the figure of percentage of GNP spent on health care if dentistry and optometry were included in the accounting?  Maybe Canada spends proportionately just as much on health care as we do.   So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse. Bob Rae, the second least popular man in Ontario, warned Ontarians a few years ago that if they didn't stop cross-border shopping in such huge numbers, \\\"the services they expect from the province just won't be there in a few years\\\" (Fortunately for them (and less fortunately for the retailers here in Western New York) the  Canadian dollar went back to a more realistic value). He didn't say so, but I knew he meant the OHIP. What would happen if his warning turned out to be the  truth? Would the private insurers take up the slack? They'd be under no  obligation to. Of course, they could eventually make money again, but if what you say is true, they'd be loathe to do so (and out of practice in handling  such basic services, too).   Would that it were free. Americans would start another revolution if they had to pay taxes at Canadian rates. \",\"/(hudson) /Yes you do.  Who is to say that it is immoral for onesself to experience /pain or to be hurt in some other way.  Maybe unpleasant, but that doesn't /say anything about morality.  It violates free will, Hudson.    (me)  /(hudson) /Why is making someone a less productive member of society immoral?  Hudson, you are screwing up again.  Morality does not (I say again, DOES NOT) define only \\\"right and wrong\\\".  It also defines \\\"acceptable social behavior\\\", without any overtones of good and evil.  Picking up your trash is not really a right/wrong moral issue in the eternal sense of Good and Evil.  Yet it is moral in the sense that it is acceptable social behavior\\\".    Your definition of the word \\\"morality\\\" is what is causing you to trip over  yourself here.     /(me) /And since />I, selfish being that I am, want to maximize my gains from society, I will />not do anything to another member of society if that action might cut down />on how much benefit I can derive from society.  /(hudson) /Why is your benefit somehow related to morality.  Again, your definition is causing you to shoot yourself in the foot.      /(hudson) /What about if someone feels that their own personal benefit is enhanced /more than it would be damaged by depleting the overall resources of society? /Maybe something might hurt society, but it would help him immensly?  That is irrational thinking.    There may also be people out there who think that death by atomic  destruction is  a sublime and wonderful thing. I am not going to let them execute that idea just because they want to do it.   Simply because I let people make up their minds about what morals they have doesn't prevent me from spotting and stopping a madman when I see one, Hudson.  And even then, I will only stop him when he interferes  with me and my life.  That is the difference between me and you:  you want to interfere in people's lives even when they aren't affecting you.        /(hudson) /The central character in Dostoevsky's novel, Crime and Punishment,  /(R something or other) reasoned that if killed this old Jewish woman and /stole her money to educate and establish himself financially, he could /make a great contribution to society.  He reasoned that she was not of  /much profit to society.  She just collected rents, and hoarded money.   One of the central points of any (that's ANY) moral system is that is has to be internally consistent.    By killing her, the character had to accept the premise that the ends justify the means.  If he accepted that premise, then (in order to be consistent), he must accept the idea that some day another person may apply the same standard to HIS life.  Now, if he is unwilling to accept this premise (which he will not be willing to accept), then he has behaved inconsistently with his own moral standard.      /(me) /[football example deleted]  /(hudson) /Now suppose a freshman on the bench will only get to play if one of the /players in the field/on the court is injured (or killed.)

Two problems right off the bat:  1.  The problem with your analogy is that it doesn't address the goal that I started with:  winning the game.

Good Luck\",\" If we had backed him strongly early on I doubt there would be the problem there is now.  Many Russians became disillusioned with democracy and reforms when they felt, rightly IMO, that the West didn't care.  Yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid (once Bush got over his Gorby-mania.)  This probably kept him from dismantling the congress and calling for new elections.  Well, the aid didn't come through and we didn't make sure it went to the proper places and now the anti-reformers are gaining strength where before they were in hiding.   If they don't reform I don't believe in giving them money.  However, I think this is too important to take a non-interventionist approach. This is what really bugs me about Libertarianism -- it sounds like 'it'll all be the same in a hundred years time.  no need to do anything.'  Despite the wishes of Libertarians, this society is a far way, and getting farther, from being Libertarian.  Perhaps voluntary gifts would work if we had the proper framework but we do not have it.  We have to face the problem *now*, not in X years when we have a Libertarian dream society.  Right now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade, let alone charity. There are still limitations to high-tech exports.  NASA can't buy Proton launch vehicles from them.  Sure, the market may be able to help a great deal but it can't right now.  There are too many obstacles. Instead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to  tear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face.  Well, I think limited government is primarily democratic due to it being limited.  But the main question is how do you transform a state-run economy and monolithic government into something that even remotely looks like ours?  (BTW, sometimes it seems that our government  is trying to go the opposite direction)  It is not going to be painless and not going to be easy.  We simply cannot wait to help when they *have* the 'proper' government.  They'll never get there without the aid.  It may be too late already.   And I'm just excercising mine.   As I also said above, another problem I have is with *transformation*. A Libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight. I have seen nothing about how to take our current government and society and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible self-sufficient populace.     They didn't have nuclear weapons 100 years ago.  Nor instantaneous communications nor travel to virtually anyplace on the earth in less than a day.   Yes, depend on the rulers of the free market and the businesses.  Rulers do emerge *somewhere* and they will never represent the opinions of every person on the planet.    There must be checks and balances.  Checks on the government when it gets out of bounds and checks on industry when it gets out of bounds.  Putting all your hopes on the benevolence of the market is, to me, just like putting all your hopes on the benevolence of government.  \",\"Hi!

Notwithstanding the military     establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are     carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments     are afraid to trust the people with arms.\\\"                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434, 8 June 1789: \\\"The right     of the people to keep and bear... arms shall not be infringed.

The Amendment does nor refer to \\\"well organized\\\", it says \\\"well regulated\\\".  I have some targets you may examine if you wish to check how _well regulated_ I am.     Correct.  That's why the Right is reserved to the People.  And that was to insure the People could form a \\\"well regulated Militia\\\", not a \\\"well organized militia\\\".

He only wrote it.   That's obviously because you've never actually *read* the Federalist Papers.    Can't read, huh?  Show me where the document says \\\"well organized militia\\\".    That is *exactly* why EVERY PERSON should be allowed to own *any* weapon currently in use in the armed forces.   But the major reason is to protect against that very same army.

EX:  I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM, an external video card (so I don't rob my SIMM's), and the default Apple cache card (I believe this is 32K?).  Say I have my cache set at 2 MEG, what good does a measly 32K do me on the cache card?  Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache between the card and the SIMM's?  Or does it still speed things up by providing a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly into the SIMM RAM cache?  I'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to really do any good compared to what you can set yourself.  Yet, Daystar FastCache has numbers which show around a 30% performance boost on some operations.  Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMM accesses?

Yesterday I was able to watch FOUR games...the NJ-PITT at 1:00 on ABC, LA-CAL at 3:00 (CBC),  BUFF-BOS at 7:00 (TSN and FOX), and MON-QUE at 7:30 (CBC).  I think that if each series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd consecutive nights (I haven't counted so that's a pure guess).  I have two tv's in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUE and keep an eye on BOS-BUFF at the same time.  I did the same for the two afternoon games.  Btw, those ABC commentaters were great!  I was quite impressed; they seemed to know that their audience wasn't likely to be well-schooled in hockey lore and they did an excellent job.  They were quite impartial also, IMO.  \",\" ------------ Part 3 of 14 ------------ M\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(G.3DY.3DY.3DY.3DY.3DY.3DY.3DY.2#IJ:FIJ:F M@^3DY.3DG.OKZZNKJZOKZYSDY.2#IJ9$B-RYB(C<$!\\\"(H#YM.LISRG-SV#HZ MRG/8<]C*<VW8.MC8V#K*RLIS.M@Z<]C*<]C8V,HZ.FW*.MAM<W-S<W,Z<\\\\IM M;<J6<]@\\\\RD%M<\\\\IM\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@```\\\"\\\"$Q.\\\"`\\\"MAFYN;/JZ(N;G<B*Z@ M/IN;\\\"I\\\\7]1>?@0H*FYN;FSX^/J\\\"@KJZNB(C<N;FYN;:VN;FYN;FYN;FY/#Q% MW3S==]W1W3S=17?=/$5%=]UW147117?=W7?==W=W=]W=T7=WW=W==X6%W=UW M0(5`0-W==W?==X710-W=A4!WW=V%A=W==]U`2=U)=]UW=W=W=]U`W2/=A85W M0-W=A=V%W=%`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`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(G)R<G)R<G)SDY.3DY.3D MY.3DY.3DY.2#IJ:FIJ:F@^3DY.3DG.OKJZNKJZOKZYSDY.2#IJ9$B+FYB(B( MN1`0KJ\\\"NRLIS<T%SV,K8V,J6V#K8V,K*V-AM<]AM<\\\\ISV'-S<W/8EFU!0<IM MRMC8.G-SELK8.MC*<\\\\K8<]C8;7/*<\\\\IS;98(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"`@(\\\"(*\\\"`(03O(0` M`\\\"L1FYL^/JZ(N;G<B*Z@/IL*@9_U]9^!\\\"@J;FYM\\\\/GP^/CZ@H*ZNKHB(W-RY MN;:YN;G<W-S<W-S<T471145WW45%=SQ%=W?1W='=W=UWW45%=W?=1=W=T=%% MW85W=]W1T=V%W7?==X5`A7=WW=V%A=V%=]V%T4#=0'?==W=WW7=WW7=WA=W= M=TEWT85WW7>%0$!`W=V%W7?=W=W=T=U`A=UW=]'=0-'==]'11=V%T7?1T7?1 MT7>%=]&%T471T47=17?=W=UW=T5W=W?1=W=%=SS=T=%WW=%%W7?==SQ%=SQ% M17=%W7<\\\\/-W=/-W=/-T\\\\W3S=W3S=T=T\\\\W7<\\\\T471=SS=/$5%/'=%17=%T=U% M/-UWW=T\\\\/#Q%T7<\\\\W47=W=UWW=W=1=W=W=W=17?11=U%1=W=1=W=W=W1T=%% MW=%%W45WT471T7?==]'=A46%1=UW1='1T=UWW471=T5WW=W=1=U%=]W=T=%% MW7?=/-W=W=$\\\\/#P\\\\1=$\\\\/#P\\\\W44\\\\/-%%W3Q%T=&61=%%/)9S13P\\\\ED5SED4\\\\ M<W-S<T78;3S8;44\\\\<Y9M<\\\\H\\\\<]C8V'-SV#S8RG-ID6G'D9&_+\\\\?'+\\\\=IQSK' M.CHZQX8ZD3J&ACK*RH;*.B]!.CHZ.LJ1.MC*RCHZD2_8D<K8RLHORI$Z.CI!

Luke's account suggests otherwise, and in the absence of direct eyewitnesses who can claim that Luke is mistaken, then I suggest that this unequivocal assertion is suspect.    --  John G.

It was an answer to the claim that the witnesses couldn't be lying because they were willign to suffer for their beliefs. Thus it's not necessary to show that no Christian ever suffered for believing in the Resurrection.  Rather the issue is whether those who witnessed it did.

Blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration rate for violent crimes.  So I doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism present.  There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories.  Interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in the rest of the United States! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt blacks.  In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).  Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a situation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and  Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses  each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin  June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours  per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.   Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact  Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below.   ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO  UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.        ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## #######################################################################               JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon  University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific  communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and  January 1994.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the  United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is  facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.   PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to  develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:  1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time.  2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in  manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a  variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or  research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.   3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,  participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.   FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

Xavier(eXtension AV class for IntERviews) is a C++ class library that adds multimedia capability to InterViews. It allows composite multimedia objects to be built from media objects.  Specifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the source code for the original classes (though several configuration files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file).    Currently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN workstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.  Xavier has been tested in the following environments:  SUN:   Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC   OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later   C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1  NEC(EWS):   Machine : EWS4800/210,230   OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1,Release5.2   C++     : C++ Release3.1  It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from            interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/           (Xavier.large-demo.tar, and Xavier.tar)  We are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier.

Dr. Sadik Ahmet, Turkish Ethnic Member of Greek Parliament, Visits US  Washington DC, July 7- Doctor Sadik Ahmet, one of the two ethnic Turkish members of the Greek parliament visited US on june 24 through July 5th and held meetings with human rights organizations and high-level US officials in Washington DC and New York.  At his press conference at the National Press Club in Washington DC, Sadik Ahmet explained the plight of ethnic Turks in Greece and stated six demands from Greek government.  Ahmet said \\\"our only hope in Greece is the pressure generated from Western capitals for insisting that Greece respects the human rights. What we are having done to ethnic Turks in Greece is exactly the same as South African Apartheid.\\\" He added: \\\"What we are facing is pure Greek hatred and racial discrimination.\\\"  Spelling out the demands of the Turkish ethnic community in Greece he said \\\"We want the restoration of Greek citizenship of 544 ethnic Turks. Their citizenship was revoked by using the excuse that this people have stayed out of Greece for too long. They are Greek citizens and are residing in Greece, even one of them is actively serving in the Greek army. Besides, other non-Turkish citizens of Greece are not subject to this kind of interpretation at an extent that many of Greek-Americans have Greek citizenship and they permanently live in the United States.\\\"  \\\"We want guarantee for Turkish minority's equal rights. We want Greek government to accept the Turkish minority and grant us our civil rights. Our people are waiting since 25 years to get driving licenses. The Greek government is not granting building permits to Turks for renovating our buildings or building new ones. If your name is Turkish, you are not hired to the government offices.\\\"  \\\"Furthermore, we want Greek government to give us equal opportunity in business. They do not grant licenses so we can participate in the economic life of Greece. In my case, they denied me a medical license necessary for practicing surgery in Greek hospitals despite the fact that I have finished a Greek medical school and followed all the necessary steps in my career.\\\"  \\\"We want freedom of expression for ethnic Turks. We are not allowed to call ourselves Turks. I myself have been subject of a number of law suits and even have been imprisoned just because I called myself a Turk.\\\"  \\\"We also want Greek government to provide freedom of religion.\\\"  In separate interview with The Turkish Times, Dr. Sadik Ahmet stated that the conditions of ethnic Turks are deplorable and in the eyes of Greek laws, ethnic Greeks are more equal than ethnic Turks. As an example, he said there are about 20,000 telephone subscribers in Selanik (Thessaloniki) and only about 800 of them are Turks. That is not because Turks do not want to have telephone services at their home and businesses. He said that Greek government changed the election law just to keep him out of the parliament as an independent representative and they stated this fact openly to him. While there is no minimum qualification requirement for parties in terms of receiving at least 3% of the votes, they imposed this requirement for the independent parties, including the Turkish candidates.  Ahmet was born in a small village at Gumulcine (Komotini), Greece 1947. He earned his medical degree at University of Thessaloniki in 1974. he served in the Greek military as an infantryman.  In 1985 he got involved with community affairs for the first time by collecting 15,000 signatures to protest the unjust implementation of laws against ethnic Turks. In 1986, he was arrested by the police for collecting signatures.   Serdar Argic\",\" :      For all the problems technology has caused, your types have made : things even worse.

We have several Network General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on several hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy,  2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility, 4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely operated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual  manipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found  it 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for many protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle TCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily modified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems by adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.  Tcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and SunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump. It compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will need Motif 1.1 or better.  The following files are available for anonymous ftp from  ftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking  tcpview-1.0.tar.Z tcpview and tcpdump source code tcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z Sun4 binaries tcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z DEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries  What tcpview adds to tcpdump: - easier interface - enhanced protocol decoding - hex display of frame - capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt - can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name - ethernet address host table - can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames - can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional  processing.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1  New features:  Now reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r', the  file type will be automatically detected.  Can now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file.  The hex format has been changed.  New time options have been added.  Options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets.  Bugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag)  New flags: -R read Sniffer file.  Not usually needed, except for reading from stdin -ttt prints delta times -tttt prints times relative to the first frame -W write a Sniffer save file (use with -w) -x print frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.
