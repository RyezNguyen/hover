The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is the National Security Agency (NSA)? * What are the US export regulations? * What is TEMPEST? * What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax? * What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch? * Is RSA patented? * What about the Voynich manuscript?   * What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?    The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It   was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and   has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is   known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,   and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the   world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of   cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many   years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break   many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national   security almost all information about the NSA is classified.    Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of   the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the   difference between public and private research in cryptography:    ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,   one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted   behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged   today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of   those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10   years has there in fact been widespread open research in   cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts   between these two research communities. Open research is common   quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open   exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in   scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with   responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,   countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can   a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might   undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?   One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would   force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one   must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with   political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most   scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have   occurred between government agencies and open researchers in   cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which   we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''  * What are the US export regulations?    In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control   export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export   Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by   the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office   of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized   by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule   of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent   requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see   everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.    The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting   discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what   people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which   go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to   consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in   jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at   least heard of the ITAR.  * What is TEMPEST?    TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer   equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that   information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at   quite a distance and with little effort.    Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext   is available this way.  * What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?    (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for   corrections.)    The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas   Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass   of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving   three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the   location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.   Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;   it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the   Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;   many documents have been tried as the key to B1.    Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various   means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:    The Beale Cypher Association   P.O. Box 975   Beaver Falls, PA 15010    You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the   line:    send index    in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.   (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher   floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,   says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)    Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of   problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI   and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.   Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this   string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an   explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this   string.  * What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?    The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis   on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with   pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes   articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in   English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,   Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.    Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;   less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent   to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.  * Is RSA patented?    Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.   For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been   granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral   issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information   about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of   the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as   ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other   technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.  * What about the Voynich manuscript?    nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the   subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list   is: <voynich-request@rand.org>    the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich\",\"  I have seen Jeff Fenholt speak and I didn't find him judgemental.  I think that the wording for that add was certainly inappropriate, but I think they were trying to say that headbangers would like the program.  But I would NOT put headbangers in the same class as alcholics, etc.  it is condescending.  And I believe that Jeff was wearing black when I saw him.  By the way, Fenholt played Jesus in Jesus Christ Superstar.  Personally, I'm a headbanger at times too, but I have a hard time with what most of the secular metal groups promote.  Free sex and drugs (my opinion that many promote these) aren't my thing.  I HAVE found several good Christian metal groups that I like.

I thought you're gonna say fromn misisipi back to the misisipi !   Let's say : \\\" let's establish the islamic state first\\\" or \\\"let's free our occupied lands first\\\". And then we can dream about expansion, Mr. Gideon \",\"     Okay... I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are different ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much recent evidence for this statement is present in the book \\\"Brainsex\\\" by Anne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it. Their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and is well referenced.   Now, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women are different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into account that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules it would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this instance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of where men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!  Now, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression. However, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT.  Men do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same extent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a man _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And therefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave, NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.  Maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the sexism here just reflects the \\\"sexism\\\" of nature in making men and women different.  There are many other differences between men and women which are far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I recommend you have a look at the book \\\"Brainsex\\\".  Your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious. If men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically become women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is -- so your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that  women can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports my statement that maternity leave is sexist.   There is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is taken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and female Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from early Islamic history is the Prophet's widow, Aisha, who was recognized in her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.   You have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and I dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I recently reposted something here under the heading \\\"Islam and Women\\\" -- if it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted from soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it still might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title was though).  I will email it to you if you like.    Your statement that \\\"other religions are no different\\\" is, I think, a statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than Christianity and perhaps Judaism.   Aisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also was, at one stage, a military leader.   The Prophet's first wife, who died just before the \\\"Hijra\\\" (the Prophet's journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.  Lucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your viewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.\",\" \\\"...a la Chrysler\\\"??  Okay kids, to the nearest thousand, how many dollars did the government spend to \\\"bail out\\\" Chrysler?  More than zero you say?    Bzzzzzzzzzt.  Wrong answer.\",\" So the only way you can tell a false hadith from a true one is if it contradicts the Quran?  What if it relates to something that isn't explicitly spelled out in the Quran?  Also, the Quran wasn't written down during the life of Muhammed either.  It wasn't long after, but 20 years or so is still long enough to shift a few verses around.

About 4 or 5 weeks ago I read in the Toronto Sun a quote from Alex; it went something like [sarcastically]:  \\\"Yep, Patty's the man.  He's responsible for the team's success...I'm a  nobody around here.\\\"  I was going to post it at the time...I must have forgot since nobody else  was talking about him being a problem.   Yep, I'd beat the shit out of him too.  LaFontaine really must be a team player...makes you wonder what the Islander management was thinking. My question is what the hell is Muckler doing?  Whether he wishes to admit it or not, the team is his to coach, and if he can't do the job then maybe the job should be given to somebody who can.    Gee, kinda like Alex's spot on the team, isn't it?\",\"THE DIVINE MASTERS                              Most Christians would agree, and correctly so, that            Jesus Christ was a Divine Master, and a projection of God            into the physical world, God Incarnate.                            But there are some very important related facts that            Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of            most other world religions.                             First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-           STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master            (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES,            a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and            after the life of Jesus.                      The followers of some of these Masters founded the            world's major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of            their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added            THREATS of \\\"ETERNAL DAMNATION\\\" in Hell, and DELETED the            teaching of REincarnation.                         Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular            Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is            NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively            few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY            alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE            UNIVERSES.)                                              Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and            pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from            their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed            themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly            MANUFACTURED by the Romans.                        And emotional \\\"feelings\\\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING            indicator for religious validity.                      These things are similarly true for followers of most            other major world religions, including Islam.                       Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune            His Initiates into the \\\"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\\\" or \\\"SOUND            CURRENT\\\", (referred to as \\\"THE WORD\\\" in John 1:1-5, and as            \\\"The River of Life\\\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally            guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they            are still connected to their living physical bodies by a            \\\"silver cord\\\".                      True Salvation, which completes a Soul's cycles of            REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved            only by reaching at least the \\\"SOUL PLANE\\\", which is five            levels or universes above the physical universe, and this            canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine            Master.                      One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri            Harold Klemp, the Living \\\"Eck\\\" Master or \\\"Mahanta\\\" for the            \\\"Eckankar\\\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis,            (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427).                      Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now            living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \\\"Sant            Mat\\\" organization.                        One of the classic books on this subject is \\\"THE PATH OF            THE MASTERS\\\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA             90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian            and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India            studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of            that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji.                      Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored            by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in            most public and university libraries and some book stores, or            obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \\\"ECKANKAR--THE            KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\\\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER            classic.                      Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with            the \\\"Anti-Christ\\\", which is or was to be a temporary world            dictator during the so-called \\\"last days\\\".  But the Masters            don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as            Jesus was.                      People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or            other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will            CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the            Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they            finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine            Master.                                 RE-INCARNATION                           The book \\\"HERE AND HEREAFTER\\\", by Ruth Montgomery,            describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation            as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past            lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes            makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist],            SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of            whom can identify their most recent previous relatives,            homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-           ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-           ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-           ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS            FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the            Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How            can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED            BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the \\\"KING JAMES VERSION\\\".  Later            versions are PER-VERSIONS! ]                            Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc.,            typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example,            a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually            results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.             And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to            another person being met for the first time in THIS life,            because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS            INCARNATION.                  The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF            KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would            behave much better toward each other if they knew that their            actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the            future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION!               \\\"2nd COMINGS\\\"                 If a Divine Master physically dies (\\\"translates\\\")            before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that            Initiate physically dies (\\\"translates\\\"), the Master will meet            him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul            Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd            Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that            happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still            waiting for Jesus' \\\"2nd Coming\\\" are WAITING IN VAIN.                                       PLANES OF EXISTENCE                 The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN            major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the            Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric            Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane),            the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The            Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from            the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the            Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes.                      It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological            influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See            the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without            an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between            the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane.                      The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a            sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called \\\"Hades\\\", and the            Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there            LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some            kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a            THREATENING manner.  The Christian \\\"Heaven\\\" is located            elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there            for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth.                                             SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH                 The Christian religion demands of its followers an            extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more            than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING).                         If a person is not HEARING some form of the \\\"SOUND            CURRENT\\\" (\\\"THE WORD\\\", \\\"THE BANI\\\", \\\"THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\\\"),            then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL            CONTINUE.                      The \\\"SOUND CURRENT\\\" manifests differently for different            Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on            the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a            flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar,            Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as            a Member.  This and other experiences (such as \\\"SOUL TRAVEL\\\")            REPLACE blind faith.

If the value is less than the current size of the actual environment, this setting is disabled, as if it were 0.  If you specify the environment size in a PIF file for COMMAND.COM, the PIF setting overrides this setting.  The default is 0 with MSDOS versions earlier than 3.2.

It's one of those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression. What Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I'm sure, is that when people read this they think violent arguments where one member of the family grabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation which could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or a tragic accident, especially involving a child.         Unfortunately, that's not the way things stack up.  The majority of that 43 \\\"times\\\" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone  intentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill  themselves.  And why it's popular to try and blame suicides on guns, the evidence doesn't support this.  Internal studies, as well as comparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural factors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not. (Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There people jump off buildings.)         According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime is commited by \\\"non-strangers,\\\" which mistakenly has been generalized regarding the King County study to mean, \\\"Friends and family.\\\"  That is, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on the mental image that a \\\"Friend, family member, or child,\\\" equates to a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of anger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives, children assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by  someone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun was used against a \\\"friend\\\" or family member doesn't mean they weren't trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among poor urban families, and those are also the areas most \\\"at risk\\\" for family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may not be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban kid might.         Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the only value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I worked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly self-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses. Between the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there's an enormous amount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers. As such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid means of determining the success of such a defense, since according to the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report defenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders killed.         Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a \\\"friend or family member\\\" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense which occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in businesses.)          I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can't comment.  I will point out Canada's and Japan's suicide rate as indications that culture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.         There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what it's worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural lines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the exact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws  would not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate. \",\"  You didn't mention whether or not cost is an issue.

The CELP stuff is standardised, we use tcp/ip streams, and a protocol allowing silences to be used to catch up on any net lag, and also to avoid sending any data during silences (ie it's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each end because any net delays would add up to big voice-lags)  As for me, I'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as I get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone. It'll save me a fortune in calling my friend in texas every night :) (whether encrypted or not)  You know, surely *someone* is working on this.  Who?  It's so obvious, why doesn't it exist already?  I've only seen netphone for Suns and it didn't do the CELP compression so was restricted to ether connections.\",\" I had knee surgery while I was in the Navy back in 77.  The  doctors put me in a cast from ass-to-ankle.  My only method of transportaion  was a DOHC 450 Honda at the time.  I found that by sliding back on the seat  I could use my heel (did I mention it was my left leg?) to operate the shift. I would hook the end of the lever with my heel and lift my entire leg for up- shifts and just drop my leg on the lever for the down-shifts.  Forget  nutral, took WAY too much finesse for the leg!

Bussard, Journal of  Propulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990       Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion      systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the      thrust-power \\\"gain\\\" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values      of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are      always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \\\"high-thrust\\\"      interplanetary flight is not possible, because system      acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local      gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100      times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer      \\\"high-thrust\\\" flight capability. One performance example shows a      53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with      19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows      the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in      Earth/moon space.   \\\"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for  Aerospace Flight Propulsion\\\" by Robert W.

Farnsworth/Hirsch      demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with their device back in      1969 but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising      stability of the Soviet Tokamak.

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion  Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.       Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron      flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times      larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma      pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds      could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities      and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and      other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm      innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure      efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically      compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power      conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens      of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the      multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages      indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I      strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob      Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently      declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one      of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather      than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the      PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid      MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]      ION DRIVES:   Retrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACE  archive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe the  SERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters in  the 1960s and 70s.

Burleigh Grimes went from 20+ wins and an ERA of 3 or so in '24 to 13-19 and an ERA around 4 in '25.  He pitched well for several more years.  Carlton won 13 and lost 20 the year after his 27-10 record. (Source: Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract.)      And let's not forget John Tudor, who started 1-5 and finished 21-6 in 1985.  He had a pretty bad ERA when you take Busch Stadium into account at the start of the season.        If I recall, he had a 4.50 ERA in the 1st half and a 3.50 ERA in the 2nd half of last year.        Hmmm, 21 runs in 11 innings.  Suppose he starts 30 more games, and winds up w/200 innings pitched.  If he allows 4 runs a game in the next 189 innings, he'll have a 4.75 ERA or so at the end of the year. (I think I have his totals right.) This is going to be hard to come back from.        My 1st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy, and that he may be pitching through an injury and not telling anyone.  My 2nd guess is that he will be banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts. (Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL?  Or will Danny Cox, who went 3 or 4 scoreless innings against the Tribe today, start for Morris?  He looks like a really good one.  Gaston is scrambling to find starters, I'd imagine. Luckily, the Jays have a very good offense.)      I don't think they would dare release him before the end of the year.

It (this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.  This month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply with the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy manipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know what you think.  DISCLAIMER ---------- Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything other than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk to a real lawyer.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ---------------------  1)  What is RIPEM?   RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using  the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your  electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who  sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except  the intended recipient.)   RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.  Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,  which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.  2)  How can I get RIPEM?   RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is  considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution  to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or  Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README  file:   #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution  #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,  #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.   Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is  included with the distribution.  You should read it before using  RIPEM.   The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will  reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the  humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the  friend.   RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents  in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for  info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and  does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.   RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \\\"home site\\\" on  rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the  U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out  how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file  GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are  available here in addition to the full source tree.  3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?   Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of  Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to  Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice  Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports  are expected, and help of users is invited.  4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?   Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend  on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users  guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM  with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.  Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU  Emacs.   If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one  in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,  and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.  5)  What is RSA?   RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means  that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to  decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,  you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your  decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public  key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to  decrypt it.  (Note that the \\\"message\\\" sent with RSA is normally just  the DES key to the real message. (See \\\"What is DES?\\\")   Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,  the fingerprint of the message (See \\\"What is a fingerprint, like  MD5?\\\") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can  use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message  must have come from the sender.   RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who  invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in  pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.  6)  What is DES?   DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or  secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to  encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.   RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts  your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the  recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,  allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.   DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a  key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it  should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large  corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future  RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using  multiple encryption with DES.  7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?   PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of  encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these  documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.   RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM  specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not  handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.  8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?   For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know  your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message  received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important  that this information be accurate; if a \\\"bad guy\\\" convinces her that  his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.   RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,  the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are  described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.  None of them provide perfect security.  9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?   RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various  characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in  your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the  same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the  same length, etc.  10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?   MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.  It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,  of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not  possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a  different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,  instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,  only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.   MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often  used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a  passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.   MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in  RFC 1321.  11)  What is PGP?   PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.  PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.  PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.   Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:   - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without    a direct network connection.   - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of    working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible    with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with    PGP 2.0.)   - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security    Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.    PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,    PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims    that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in    the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original    author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:     #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency,     #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public    #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is    #contraband.     - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside    the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites    in Europe and other places.   Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is  recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.   Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export  restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it  shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents  differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably  seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in  misc.legal.computing.  (See:  \\\"DISCLAIMER\\\")  12)  What about RPEM?   RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,  but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in  an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark  Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.   Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many  (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent  was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested  in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.  This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not  challenged for pragmatic reasons.   RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.  13)  What is MIME?   MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is  described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup  comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely  clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type  application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I  hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on  the matter.  14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\",\"Hi,  We've been having problems on a few setups when printing to a serial printer (dmp or Laser).

Here are a few complications:  1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request \\\"5a\\\", \\\"5b\\\", \\\"5c\\\" and  \\\"5d\\\" separately  2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was  re-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with Solaris]  3) fix 8 is in two parts: \\\"8a\\\" and \\\"8b\\\"  4) fix 13 is in three parts: \\\"13a\\\", \\\"13b\\\", and \\\"13c\\\"  5) fix 16 is in two parts: \\\"16a\\\" and \\\"16b\\\"  6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which  previously was optional  7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff by asking for \\\"PEXlib.uu.[1234]\\\".  8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, \\\"22a\\\" through \\\"22i\\\"  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?   The xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail  it a request, and it mails back the response.  Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can  have several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help).  The xstuff server treats the \\\"Subject:\\\" header line just like any other line  of the message.  The archives are organized into a series of directories and  subdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an  index. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the  subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.   1) The command \\\"help\\\" or \\\"send help\\\" causes the server to send you a  more detailed version of this help file.  2) if your message contains a line whose first word is \\\"index\\\", then  the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then  the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index.  For example, you can say \\\"send index fixes\\\" (or \\\"index fixes\\\"). A message that  requests an index cannot request data.  3) if your message contains a line whose first word is \\\"send\\\", then the xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name  an item, you give its directory and its name. For example                 send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9  You may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many  safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large  amounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the  day's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day.  Whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out  shortest-first.  4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting  return addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response.  If  you happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like         path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu or         path bar!foo!frotz in the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.   The xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If  your mailer deals in \\\"!\\\" notation, try sending to  {someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.

You can obtain either OSF/Motif source or binaries from a number of  vendors.   Motif 1.2.2 source is now available; it is based on X11R5.  Motif 1.1 is based on the R4.18 Intrinsics and is currently [7/92] at  1.1.5.  An OSF/Motif source license must be obtained from OSF before source can be obtained from the Open Software Foundation or any value-added vendor for any version. Call the Direct Channels Desk at OSF at 617-621-7300 for ordering  information.  Various hardware vendors produce developer's toolkits of binaries,  header files, and documentation; check your hardware vendor, particularly if that vendor is an OSF member.   In addition, independent binary vendors produce Motif toolkits for machines for which Motif is not supported by a vendor; the kits include varied  levels of bug-fixing and support for shared libraries and are based on widely divergent version of Motif:  Quest (408-988-8880) sells kits for Suns, as well;   IXI (+44 223 462 131) offers kits for Sun3 and Sun4.

It has also announced  Motif 1.2 for Solaris systems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  62)  Does Motif work with X11R4? X11R5?   Motif 1.2 is based on X11R5.  Motif 1.1, available in source form from OSF as of August 1990, uses  the \\\"vanilla\\\" X11R4 Intrinsics, where \\\"vanilla\\\" means \\\"with just a few  patches\\\"; the file fix-osf which OSF distributes is obsoleted by MIT's patches  15-17.  The file fix-osf-1.1.1 distributed with the 1.1.1 version or its  subsequent modification needs to be applied after MIT fix-18, though.   Motif 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 will work with X11R5 if X11R5 is compiled with -DMOTIFBC; 1.1.4 and later should work with the vanilla R5, although there are  some known new geometry-management problems.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  63)  Where can I get toolkits implementing OPEN LOOK?

The GhostView, Xfig, and vimage packages also include file-selector  widgets.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  67)  What widget is appropriate to use as a drawing canvas?   Some widget sets have a widget particularly for this purpose -- a WorkSpace or DrawingArea which doesn't display anything but lets your Xt  application know when it has been re-exposed, resized, and when it has received user key and mouse input.   The best thing to do for other widget sets -- including the Athena set  -- is to create or obtain such a widget; this is preferable to drawing into a  core widget and grabbing events with XtAddEventHandler(), which loses a number  of benefits of Xt and encapsulation of the functionality .    At least one version has been posted to comp.sources.x (name???).   The publicly-available programs xball and xpic include other versions.   The Athena Widget manual (mit/doc/Xaw/Template in the R5 distribution)  includes a tutorial and source code to a simple widget which is suitable for  use.   The Free Widget Foundation set contains a Canvas widget.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  68)  What is the current state of the world in X terminals?

Seth Robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu) has written Xkernel; the current version [1.4 as of 8/91, 2.0 expected RSN] is on sol.ctr.columbia.edu  [128.59.64.40] in /pub/Xkernel.gamma. It turns a Sun 3/50 into a pseudo- X  terminal; most of the overhead of the operating system is side-stepped, so it  is fairly fast and needs little disk space.  A similar approach is to run the regular X server by making /etc/init a shell script which does the minimal setup and then invokes Xsun, like this example script from mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.EDU:  #! /bin/sh exec >/dev/console 2>&1 /etc/fsck -p /dev/nd0 case $? in   0) ;;   4) /etc/reboot -q -n    ;;   8) echo ND fsck failed - get help    /etc/halt    ;;   12) echo Interrupted    /etc/reboot    ;;   *) echo Unknown error in reboot fsck - get help    /etc/halt    ;; esac /bin/dd if=/tmp-fs of=/dev/nd2 bs=512 count=128 >/dev/null 2>&1 /etc/mount /dev/nd2 /tmp /etc/ifconfig le0 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 132.206.41.255 /etc/mount -o ro apollo:/u2/x11/lib /local/lib/X11 /etc/route add default 132.206.41.1 1 >/dev/null set `/etc/ifconfig le0` exec /Xsun -once -multidisp -mux -query \\\\  `(sh -vn </local/lib/X11/xdm-servers/$2 2>&1)`  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  76)  What terminal emulators other than xterm are available?

A definition of any type of 'phobe comes from : phobia = an irrational fear of.  Hence a homophobe (not only in ACT UP meetings, : the word is apparently in general use now.  Or perhaps it isn't in the bible?   : Wouldst thou prefer if I were to communicate with thou in bilespeak?) :  : Does an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of being a spider?  Does an : agoraphobe have an irrational fear of being a wide open space?  Do you : understand English? :  : Obviously someone who has  phobia will react to it.  They will do their best : to avoid it and if that is not possible they will either strike out or : run away.  Or do gaybashings occur because of natural processes?  People : who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or : cause them (or themselves) violence. :   Isn't that what I said ... What are you taking issue with here, your remarks are merely parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful.  : [...] :  : |> It would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function : |> (other than limiting population growth) since evolution only occurs : |> when the members of one generation pass along their traits to : |> subsequent generations. Homosexuality is an evolutionary deadend. If I : |> take your usage of the term, homophobe, in the sense you seem to : |> intend, then all men are really homosexual and evolution of our : |> species at least, is going nowhere. : |>  :  : So *every* time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children? : Hmm...no wonder the world is overpopulated.  Obviously you keep to the : Monty Python song:  \\\"Every sperm is sacred\\\".  And if, as *you* say, it has : a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is, by your own  : arguement, natural.  Consider the context, I'm talking about an evolutionary function. One of the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a species procreate, those who don't have no purpose in that context.  :  : |> Another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to : |> survive, the participation of both parents is necessary - a family must : |> exist, since homosexuals do not reproduce, they cannot constitute a : |> family. Since the majority of humankind is part of a family, : |> homosexuality is an evolutionary abberation, contrary to nature if you : |> will. : |>  :  : Well if that is true, by your own arguements homosexuals would have  : vanished *years* ago due to non-procreation.  Also the parent from single : parent families should put the babies out in the cold now, cos they must, : by your arguement, die.  By your argument, homosexuality is genetically determined. As to your second point, you prove again that you have no idea what context means. I am talking about evolution, the preservation of the species, the fundamental premise of the whole process. :  : |> But it gets worse. Since the overwhelming majority of people actually : |> -prefer- a heterosexual relationship, homosexuality is a social : |> abberation as well. The homosexual eschews the biological imperative : |> to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in : |> the most fundamental social element, the family. But wait, there's : |> more. : |>  :  : Read the above.  I expect you to have at least ten children by now, with : the family growing.  These days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly : without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure.  In pre-pill : and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children. : These days is just ain't true!  People can decide whether or not to have  : children and when.  Soon they will be able to choose it's sex &c (but that's  : another arguement...) so it's more of a \\\"lifestyle\\\" decision.  Again by : your arguement, since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must : be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children.  Both are  : as \\\"unnatural\\\" as each other.  Yet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists for procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. That homosexuals don't procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and nothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.  :  : |> Since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some : |> policy makers that they have civil rights, they are now claiming that : |> their sexuality is a preference, a life-style, an orientation, a : |> choice that should be protected by law.

Who are you to tell anyone else how to live : their life?  Are you god(tm)?  If so, fancy a date?  Here's pretty obvious dodge, do you really think you've said anything or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement? I am not telling anyone anything, I am demonstrating that there are arguments against the practice of homosexuality (providing it's a merely an alternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonably call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. I realize of course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value, and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis, but if you are to be consistent, you have no case in this regard. :  : |> To characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to : |> ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of : |> the homosexual \\\"life-style\\\".

Fact is, Jim, there are far more persuasive arguments for : |> suppressing homosexuality than those given, but consider this a start. : |>  :  : Again crap.  All your arguments are based on outdated ideals.  Likewise the : bible.  Would any honest Christian condemn the ten generations spawned by : a \\\"bastard\\\" to eternal damnation?

Your arguments are very reactionary; do you have anything at all to contribute?  :  : |> As to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in : |> scouting, the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from : |> teaching; by their own logic, homosexuals are deviates, social and : |> biological.

Some say that if the two have : publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and : are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective : qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.  The way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically* married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.  e.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall leave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh'' (Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).  If you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the phraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. This implies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the point of intercourse.  Compare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary was pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were *betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which required a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary and Joseph went to bed together.  Compare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is described as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes  place when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with Jesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will take place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse, because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.  In summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is not marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the point when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean the civil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.) Historically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a marriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since Napoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to be corrected on that point!)  This view obviously raises some questions:  What about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering marriage. Are those people also ``married''?  If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary to be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours the laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep together though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God- honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before actually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and also to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)  --   ----- Michael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)\",\"This article was probably generated by a buggy news reader. \",\"(quoting someone else here)            Yeah!

I answer in the affirmative.  Now this answer might sound a little intellectually dishonest to Bob, but I think I have been accused before of that heinous crime and am man enough to take it.  !-)  What thinking person has not at one time or other been accused of it?   Is it politically correct for Christians to be the only besieged group permitted the luxury of arrogance?     Now I have a question for Bob.  Why in the world would any self-respecting atheist want to subscribe to a Christian news group?  I have a  difficult enough time keeping up with it, and I think I know something about the subject.       Bob reminds me of my roommate.  In order to disbelieve atheism, he says  he will need to be proven wrong about it.  Well, I don't even waste  my time trying.  I tell him that he'll just have to take my word for it.  In response, he tells me he will say an \\\"atheist's prayer\\\" for me.   Good luck, Bob.

I like it a lot better than the 900/950 design, except for those people who need Drive Arrays. I do, however, agree with you about the LW Pro design.       Again, its's not Apple's place to make it easy for non-certified service people to fool around with Apple hardware, even if they did buy it. Of course you are free to do what you want to your Mac, just don't get upset when your Apple Service Rep tells you that your warranty is no longer valid.

But of course, the popular conception of hell (correct or incorrect) is something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness, at the very least.       I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond  bodily death, but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe they're going to hell. They believe they're going to _die_. Understand that you've turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows that all animals are 'going to Hell.' Are you sure this is what you want to say? (presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven, but this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell (die a final death))     I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_ sort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and not eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that there will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence.  (assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven) In other words, I'll never know I'm dead. Hmmm...         Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died:  \\\"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Heaven now.\\\" ?      Consider the following statement:  \\\"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Hell now.\\\"      The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell,  it would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering.  Granted, they wouldn't be *anything* (wouldn't be having any conscious experience whatsoever).       You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning  to a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort  of eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to be conscious throughout this eternity.       Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the product of propaganda (\\\"Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?\\\" It's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife. Can anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all animals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the idea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of super-survival.          That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and  an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King, I might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to convert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_ by Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven.  \\\"Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?\\\" asked an Eskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something to the effect of, \\\"Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting? Scram.\\\" I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants an account of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no  immortality).         Pax,\",\"  In two places at once?

In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called \\\"stolen hits\\\", defined as a play made that \\\"an average fielder would not make with average effort.\\\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats for the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \\\"Plays Kurt Stillwell would not have made.\\\"  OK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out making ability, how many extra hits would go by?  To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double Plays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).  Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or DCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which should represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't take it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article.  The short version -- definition of terms HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder NEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate. DOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.

FBI Director's Statement On Waco Standoff  To: National Desk  Contact: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Press Office,           202-324-3691     WASHINGTON, April 19 -- The following is a statement by  FBI Director William S. Sessions regarding the Branch Davidian  incident in Waco, Texas:\",\" Aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide, so a product of its hydrolysis is going to be methanol, which can then be oxidized to formaldehyde.  The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise, since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time.  In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable. Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings, say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses the body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver. If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde, it is actually relatively non-toxic. \",\" This should not be the case if they are at all reputable. Fuel injector  cleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is hooked up to the fuel system under high pressure. The car is actually run on the solvent during the cleaning process. The equipment to properly do this is pricey, and generally not something the average home mechanic has. The solvent itself is not very expensive ($5-$8) and you could probably make up a hose to fit your system and do it yourself, but I didn't tell you that... :-)  Not many in-tank cleaners are worth wasting your money on. There has been a  discussion of these products on here from time to time, and Chevron Techron (not Pro-Gard with Techron) is generally regarded as the best. It is, however, a bit more than $1.29 a bottle. IMHO, it will not substitute for proper injector cleaning if they are really crudded up. You'll have to decide if the $59 price is a better deal than spending your time and/or buying equipment to do it.\",\"I had no possibility to join the                 7th annual X Technical Conference                 January 18-20 1993                Boston, MA  Nevertheless, I'm interested in information about the tutorials, exspecially about                  Tutorial ID:  A-SECURITY                Title: A Survey of X and Security                 Tutorial ID:  F-ADMIN                Title: X and the Administrator  Does anybody know, where I can get information (paper/mail) about these ?

Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots of hits and not many runs.

Ride safe, ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\",\"  First of all, \\\"ceremonial law\\\" is an extraScriptural term.  It is sometimes used as a framework to view Scripture.  But if you look at Collosions, without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be  a ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.  against us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what what food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days, or the keeping of the sabbath.  The word for sabbath in this verse is \\\"sabbaton\\\" and is used throughout the New Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.  If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption \\\"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law\\\" then he will have to find some way around it, like saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the 7tH day, Because \\\"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.\\\"  But Paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal  statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin in his writings.  Also, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which talks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would have been a big problem for first century Christians living in a society that did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst were slaves.  It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath if it had been mandatory.  Why is there no mention of this in the epistles?\",\" The IIvx...LCIII performance at a Centris 610 price. The only reason to get an IIvx is if you really need the full-size Nubus slots. Keep  in mind that the 610 supports all Apple monitors and has optional Ethernet. This lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the need for Nubus cards. And unless you're running FPU-intensive software, the 610 will blow the doors off the LCIII and the IIvx. The LCIII, on the other hand, is sufficient for most people and has a great price.  If you haven't guessed, I find halving the bus clock (the IIvx 32MHz uP vs. 16MHz bus) a throughly bad thing and I hope Apple never does it again. --  ______________________________________________________________________________\",\" I strongly disagree that absolute truth would not require interpretation. That's because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  Like so many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.  I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I deign from commenting much further.   Now hold it.  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as many other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that Christians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily being arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute, but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.    Not quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably* determine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible human beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The  distinction is subtle yet important.  When a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results are reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could have been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken, without sacrificing his convictions.  Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty. Throughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know with complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the right direction when he uttered, \\\"Cogito, ergo sum,\\\" yet we have not advanced much beyond that.  Do you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that the computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely certain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course, you have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all practical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with Christianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about absolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability  that they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do)  abandon these absolutes.   As I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does not mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to  render all doubts unreasonable. \",\"AS the subject says... looking for a HP 48s or perferiably HP 48sx  Please E-mail replies.

Do you mean that [] are impossible in priciple,  or merely that it would be undesirable in fact?   :Actually, the only areas of public spending above that strike me as  :generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense.  2 of the four you saw fit to  mention,  and education of minors is always another possibility,  since minors are generally considered not to be responsible to make their own decisions as adults are.  :(It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to :be to a principle of non-coercion, the only areas of public spending :that they frequently support involve hiring people with guns....hmmm...)  You say this as if it were surprising,  yet in fact a necessary consequence of libertarian philosophy.  All non-coersive functions should be dealt  with privately,  therefore it follows that the only functions remaining to the state are the coersive ones.  :Perhaps you have.  May I suggest that you consider that revolutionaries :frequently generate support by acting as protectors of \\\"geezers,\\\"  :mothers and children.  Governments that ignore such people on the grounds :that \\\"we don't have much to fear\\\" from them do so at their own peril.  Much more likely it's drunken teenagers.  The groups in questionare more  likely to be worse off during and after a revolution than before.  In the unlikely event that you missed my earlier sarcasm,  let me say this directly: The idea that such programs as Social Security or AFDC should be considered \\\"defense\\\" (an idea which has been advanced in ths and other newsgroups) is so absurd a lie as to be unworthy of consideration.  Do you seriously dispute this?    I don't want to seem patronizing,  but you still seem to be laboring under the delusion that under a socialized economic system it is reasonably intelligent and honest persons (like yourself) who make the decisions. I feel any third party added to a transaction is every bit as likely to be ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller.  I don't expect you to agree with me,  but you explain why you feel I'm wrong? \",\" The FAN is an okay Sports Radio station, but doesn't come close to the ULTIMATE in Sports Radio, 610 WIP in Philadelphia.  The signal might not be as powerful, but then again only stations in New York feel \\\"obligated\\\" to pollute everyone else's airwaves with a bunch of hoodlum Mets fans complaining 24 hours a day.  WIP took two of your best sports jockeys too, Jody MacDonald and Steve Fredericks.  610 WIP is rockin with sports talk from 5:30 AM till midnight, check it out anytime your within a few hours of Philadelphia.  If I'm not mistaken, WIP has the highest sports talk ratings in the nation?  -Rob\",\"  These arethe numbers I have been stating in the past 5-10 messages. It really angers me that you insisted you were right, and that you had no clue what your own car weighed. Why didn't you check when I first told you that your figures were implausible?    I'd like to hear a better explanatin of how you come to that  conclusion from the above data.  No, sorry your wrong again. *You* quoted the del Sol as doing 0-60 in 8.1 according to C+D. Interestingly, the Stealth ES, which is *faster* than your RT does the samerun in 8.5 seconds according to C+D. Kind of embarassing isn't it? Why didn't you check the figures  before posting? It only makes you look stupid when you are caught out twice with *your own* figures.   You really should have checked.        *2* If you insist, I gave you every chance to retract, but:    Dodge Stealth ES Auto does an 8.5/16.4 - Wonder why you couldn't find it?  Do you realize that a 9k Sentra (C+D) will run a 16.7, that a Sentra SE-R or Saturn will run in the 15's? Don't you think it is kind of strange that your 222hp sports car is so easily beaten.   A Mustang 5.0, which weights about the same (according to *your* numbers), has less power and is much quicker? Care to explain. Don't be abusive, just try and come up with a rational explanation of where those 222hp went to, its a mystery to me.  \",\"op that worked was the \\\"Macintosh |> >Software\\\" loop (whatever that means). |>  |> I doubt this is a Quadra-specific problem.

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers) =====================================================================  I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?  1. Free options  The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.  Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will  be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86  is listed below.   X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was  done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).  It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.  There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,  X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you  don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).  X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).  2. Commercial options       1) Metro Link  2213 W.

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?  3. What is XFree86?     XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with    X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and    other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:      1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,        selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require        an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of        1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by        default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield        up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.     2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default        operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now        equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately        20% faster than X386 1.2.     3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,        or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4        with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from        SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.     4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.        Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about        the ATI and Trident drivers.     5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's        code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).     6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is        compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the        contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.     7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font        renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary        distributions.     8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.     9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA        cards is now included.     The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2    (they were not in XFree86 1.1):      1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of        available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200         (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).     2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the        monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \\\"two        headed\\\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only        been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).     3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.     4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to        consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for        more information.)     5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some         versions of these devices were not previously compatible).     6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor        timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous        documentation and a lot of experimentation).     7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including        implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many         vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more         information).     8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has        been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of        0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks        line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.     9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig        configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative        and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new        options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1)         manual page for more information on the format of this file).         Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file        in the source distribution for full details.     Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the    current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.  4. What OSs are supported?      XFree86 supports:  SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2  SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC  SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2  Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1   BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active  BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.   Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,  but anyone should feel free to submit patches.  If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to  xfree86@physics.su.oz.au  5. What video hardware is supported?     At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:   Tseng ET4000  Tseng ET3000  Paradise PVGA1  Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of   the PVGA1, and use its driver)  Genoa GVGA  Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000  ATI 18800, 28800   All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,  with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in  256 color mode.   The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of  video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the  ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome  server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.   It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to  non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To  avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86  1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel  clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are  discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how  these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such  a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with  future XFree86 releases.   If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,  it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the  Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not  work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.  In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond  products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions  of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).  If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.   Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA  video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the  CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It  could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset  on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot  of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested  theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not  working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86  working fine on them.  6. What about accelerated boards?   At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards  like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available  in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).   An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact  <hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.   A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>  or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.  7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?   The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the  16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory  contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-  planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each  of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-  buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled  16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code  could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).  But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer  implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,  but nothing is yet available from the project.  8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?   Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run  X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.  The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending  on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).  To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will  be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable   lower bound.  9. Where can I get source for XFree86?   Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22  from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:   export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)   ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)   ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)  (For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)   Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information  on which files you need to get to build your distribution.  10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?   Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from:   ftp.physics.su.oz.au  - SVR4 binaries    under /XFree86/SVR4   ftp.win.tue.nl   - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/XFree86/SVR4   ferkel.ucsb.edu   - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/SVR4/XFree86   stasi.bradley.edu  - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/XFree86/SVR4   blancmange.ma.utexas.edu - SVR3 (ISC) binaries    under /pub/ISC   ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries    under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86   tsx-11.mit.edu   - Linux binaries    under /pub/linux/packages/X11   agate.berkeley.edu  - 386BSD binaries    under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86   ftp.cs.uwm.edu   - Mach binaries    under /i386   Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may  archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will  contain a README file that describes what files you need to take  from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were  made when building the distribution.  IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?  11. Installation directories   The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot  (/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include  files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.   This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified  via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is  nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed  alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.  12. Configuration files   The XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\\\"Xconfig\\\") on startup.  The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in  the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.  13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes   David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known  clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.  The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and  is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is  also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on  export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated  occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the  settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to  David for inclusion in the database.   If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file   with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.  It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use  this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information  to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.   NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and        is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot        clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from        your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The        server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.        You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your        Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up        starting the server in the future.  14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit   If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to  reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is  fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.  V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?   First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).  15. SVR4  Why won't my xterm run properly?   If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define  CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.  csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'   The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping  problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be  installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.  16. SVR3   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.  17. 386BSD   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.   Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey  <Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the  file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:       agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2      wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2      grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2  18. Linux   You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc  jump libraries installed.   Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.   If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to  run the server as \\\"X -pn\\\". The default startup configuration assumes  that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files  /usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the  -pn argument to X386.   Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major  number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not  owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit  console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but  startx won't.   When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with  a tty, for example \\\"xdm < /dev/console &\\\".   For more detailed information, please read the file README present  with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.  19. Mach   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.  VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?   This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is  fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.  Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.  VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?  20. BSD compatibility library   A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.  The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a  which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),  seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include  <X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro  definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are  linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these  functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a  21. ANSICCOPTIONS   This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the  ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite  the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see  something like   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of   ANSICCOPTIONS=\\\"-ansi\\\"   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:   ANSICCOPTIONS=  to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death  with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because  CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must  add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.

Ideally, something that is geared toward  hobbyists:  small quantity, mail order, etc.  For years, we've been buying them from a distributor (Marshall) by the hundreds for PMP kits.  But orders have dropped to the point where we can no longer afford to offer this service.  And all of the distributors I've checked have some crazy minimum order ($100, or so).  I'd like to find a source for those still interested in building PMP kits. Any suggestions?  --  Andrew C. Payne DEC Cambridge Research Lab ---  .

Since there has been some speculation on this news group about my own involvement in this project, I'd like to add that I was not in any way involved.  I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on Thursday evening, April 15.  Since then I have spent considerable time talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and I attended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16.   The document below is the result of that effort.   Dorothy Denning ---------------                       THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                 Dorothy Denning                                  April 19, 1993   INTRODUCTION  On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key.   CHIP STRUCTURE  The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is 16 Mbits a second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip   ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with the device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can be used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    The law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.   CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW  All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer information facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at Mikotronx.  At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a 64-bit block R1:          R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .  Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:            R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]          R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .  R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies.  As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips. After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind.   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2, and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies.  The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or both may be independent from the government.   LAW ENFORCEMENT USE  When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with Clipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the family key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take a warrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow agents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K. Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder operated by the FBI. \",\" I AGREE, LUMBERJACK (except that they're in 2nd)!

I'm sure we can uncover a few extremist loonies who are Catholic -- the anti-abortion movement in the USA seems to have a few hard cases in it, for example.   I have to agree Matthew with this; I have certainly encountered a lot of anti-Catholic-religion propaganda & emotion (& some bigotry) from members of certain religious groups here.  They also practice their missionary work with zeal among Catholics in the United States, but to someone who is or was raised Catholic such rhetoric is pretty off-putting.  It may work better in an environment where there's a lot of popular anti-clericalism.  Follow-ups set elsewhere, this no longer seems very relevant to Celtic issues to me.\",\" I think that HCI people honestly believe that passing more gun control laws will be in the best interests of public safety.  Why do I think this?  Because I used to buy the HCI line.  During my freshman year (1987), their line made so much sense -- only people who \\\"need\\\" guns should be able to get them, and the people who \\\"need\\\" them are the police and other elites.  Unfortunately for us, this position is highly emotional and not well thought-out.  They never stop to think that HCI's position basically says that the non-elite are incompetents (that's you and me, folks!) and that the Second Amendment has absolutely nothing to do with hunting or other \\\"legitimate\\\" uses (which excludes overthrowing tyrannical governments and defending yourself when the police have proven they can't protect you).   Every pro-control person I've talked to is always left  stumped when I simply argue the facts of gun control (that it has yet to be proven to lower crime rates) and weapons terminology (and I'm no expert -- but explaining exactly how an \\\"evil\\\" semiautomatic weapon really works does wonders).  I hvae personally found well-reasoned arguments to be most effective against the emotional pro-control people.  The trick is to get them to realize that the Second Amendment exists not for hunters but for the oppressed and the terrorized.\",\"Does anybody have an X server for NT that they're willing to share files or experiences?\",\"I'm quite astonished, shocked, and appalled at this serious frontal  assault on emerging American freedoms.  The Clinton administration  nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever  in regulating cryptography. To do so is tantamount to regulating  `acceptable' speech, and is blatantly unconstitutional. Perhaps we  should rename this year `1984' in honor of such an illustrious  proposal.  Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy, and the adminstration receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure.  I am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures.  The U.S. government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any serious threat to my liberties such as this, and I call on everyone with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this  proposal.  The administration does not seem to understand that they are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the public, and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is  wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty.   It seems to me that U.S. Diplomatic communications should be  tappable by the U.N. whenever any countries produce a warrant to the U.N.  In fact, I think we should stop paying the NSA billions of dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason. These actions violate the sovereignity of international law. (I hope Mr. Clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here. But if he isn't, it's a modest and reasonable proposal, so he should find merit with it nevertheless.)  Cryptography is neutral technology. If everybody has strong  cryptography (including policemen, bureacrats, businessmen,  housewives, thugs and hoodlums), we have a sustainable  equilibrium.  Anything less is an unworkable anti-egaltarian  arrangement, intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms, and guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent  impracticality. We don't need to compromise on issues of freedom.   For too long our government has demonstrated itself to be  increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality  and protecting Americans.   It is not possible for the Federal Government to ``act quickly'' or develop ``consistent, comprehensive policies'' PERIOD.  And even if by some grandiose miracle such a thing were possible, it would only be an efficient way to deprive American citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights.  The administration has to be committed to leaving private  industries alone, esp. on this issue.  The government has no  legitimate role in regulating the content of communications. Law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their surveillance bludgeon; they are soon and inevitably to be  disarmed of it.    No such laws can be constitutionally sound, and this is equivalent to a veiled threat, which I don't appreciate.  This kind of  extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism. I will trade threats for threats, and violation for violation.   If the administration did say this, it would find itself  impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential, established, entrenched, and explicit constitutional privacy  guarantees. The administration would have no legal standing  whatsoever; such an action would be egregiously illegal and criminal, and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast  segments of the population.   The U.S., comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically  committed to preserving their privacy in the face of an  increasingly totalitarian government, is saying just that.   Take your chips and give them to NSA employees as Christmas bonuses. We can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please,  and we will make any chips we please, and we will send any bit  pattern over our data highways we please. And if you try to stop  us, you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness.  [privacy vs. law enforcement]  This is an outright Dingaling Denning lie.  The two aims of privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally  incompatible, and you have to work for the NSA to think otherwise.  Americans are about to discover ways, through the use of technology,  to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly  been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and  *unrepresentative* government.  --\",\" I have a promovie spectrum, it seems to work very nicely with Video for Windows.

In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean an \\\"air core resonant transformer\\\". The TV flyback version Tesla coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called \\\"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit\\\" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors, which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat, gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and telegraph for communication.

The critical information from the neuron is in the firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials per seconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the signal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit convertor is more then sufficient.  AC coupling does not have to be a problem either, since in many cases you are not interested in the DC level. My pre amplifier is AC coupled also. The critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass. If the cutoff point is to high, the action potentials will be slightly distorted. But even that normally does not matter since it is the occurrence of the spike that is important.

In my follow-up to Jason Smith's posting, I will address some issues that have caused misunderstanding:     Yes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not escape your notice.   The correct word is 'likely'. There is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence, but not proved - no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense.  However, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can _predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories science has come up with have passed this test, including the Big Bang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc. It does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere 'best fits' for the data.     Well, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science requires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if the theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason. Disbelievers are not punished.    This is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_? My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is unable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God.   Yes, I know that one can't believe without God's help; Luther makes this quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. I'm afraid this does not change my situation.      (deletions)    No, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy, either something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody would ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but actually no existing being could give an answer.   Imagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also ask: \\\"Why nothing exists?\\\" This is equivalent to my counter-question, \\\"why nothing exists in nothingness\\\".   Now, \\\"why anything exists\\\" is equivalent to \\\"why something exists in somethingness\\\".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post.   I do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence, in general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still leave open the question \\\"why this, and not that\\\", and this is where theistic explanations come in.  Science cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being's existence.   This is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not? Also, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has no meaning in His case.   If I am for a reason, I've yet failed to see what it would be.  From our perspective, it looks like 'I' exist for truly random reasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can I believe there is any better reason for my existence?   Yes, I am satisfied with this reason, until I find something better. My 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect, I have to admit, but I am patient.    No, it doesn't, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists, for an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this should not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.   It is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question  \\\"why do I exist, in particular\\\" is _not_ an invalid question - this is not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to tell, and I can't just believe in any given explanation instead of another, especially since I found I was deluding myself.    I think \\\"pre-existence\\\" is an oxymoron. There is no time 'outside' of this spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that  perspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who are inside it.    No. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think philosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not knowable?   This is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous other questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base my faith on.   I think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves, \\\"why do I believe\\\" or \\\"why I don't believe\\\".

I have heard  complaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control  problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all.  There was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not  match up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the  frequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that  the NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter  and the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable  pincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness  when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the  controls.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the  raster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome  as the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.  I have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold  through OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that  way at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has  my vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if  it's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to  buy.

Check this month's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.    My criteria: a \\\"fun\\\" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K. I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out. The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag. Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS). The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy. The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.   I didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me. The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went. The Celica was \\\"ok\\\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat overpriced too) in non-turbo form. I never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it for its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind. I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more. Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)  The car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its reliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:  My dislikes: Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal. Headlights have \\\"stuck\\\" up a few times (weather?) air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch) condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely. crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical) parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical). assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not  stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke. Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies! Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when I bash my head on the corner. horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference) Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car   My Likes: engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1 handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits) transmission (the 5 speed is a must) usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere) Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive) stability at 100+mph (high gearing though) low cowl (good visibility in front) Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather) ABS/Air bag (see above) rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important) No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!) Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)  As you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.    The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the Probe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a  potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable. If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides differently (if that's \\\"better\\\" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass around you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with the heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine. Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so I can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).   I prefer cloth to leather anyway.    I wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water  generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the Eagles (and I was really trying).   There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \\\"pouch\\\" but that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO. And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!  Lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the  water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.

While I respect his right to do so, my own opinions are that (1) \\\"Followup-To\\\" fields are mere suggestions, not mandatory commands and (2) this issue is of sufficient (a) general political relevance and (b) civil liberties interest to warrant keeping it active in t.p.m and a.s.c-l as well, at least for this round.]    Okay, now here's my interpretation of _Boomer_, based on the facts as presented in the New York Court of Appeals<*> holding (_Boomer v.  <*>Note: The New York Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York    State.  While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their    highest court \\\"Supreme Court,\\\" \\\"Supreme Judicial Court\\\" or \\\"Supreme    Court of Appeals,\\\" Maryland and New York call theirs simply the    \\\"Court of Appeals.\\\"  To make matters worse, New York also calls its    _second-highest_ court the \\\"Supreme Court, Appellate Division\\\"...  Atlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):  Oscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's plant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to which came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he defendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course of its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the plaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the plant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.  (Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned their property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it. Atlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)  Instead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court ordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided that Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In other words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the power and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment of their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is always problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a private firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.  (Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  But if it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks like eminent domain...)  Let me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that \\\"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the plaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million dollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\\\"  Blackmail?      (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....     \\\"Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to     do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose     disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under     extortion statutes.\\\")  How do you define as \\\"blackmail\\\" one party's act of demanding the right to set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns and which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of demanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see it, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of owning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to stay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price they wanted.  There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says that you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.  You go on to say: \\\"The plant would never have been shut down -- the plaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement, because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to having the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\\\"  If so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those other parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choice between paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well, shouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_ business?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_ the parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was Atlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type of plant they did where and when they did.)  And then you say: \\\"Everyone's property rights were protected; the plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\\\" As above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \\\"made whole.\\\" They were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price acceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made whole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of ensuring that \\\"unnecessary\\\" settlement costs are avoided? (If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)   (1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as \\\"infamous,\\\" at least not at my school.  (Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for their first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first encountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal opinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get into their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick and choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional Responsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly and self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously intimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly biased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors tend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is especially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are practicing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_ educational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat cloistered scholar.  End of aside.)  I called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  For the reasons I've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can only call \\\"economic correctness\\\" over justice.  (2) It is \\\"completely sensible\\\" only if you believe that the alleged right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts. (And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other branch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take other people's property by eminent domain.)   Really?  I didn't know that... what, if anything, has he had to say about cases like _Boomer_?   I've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to as \\\"law and economics\\\" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical analysis as one of many \\\"tie-breaker\\\" factors which courts may use to help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by the scale of \\\"justice\\\", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by _Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics of a case as being more important than the justice of a case.\",\"Could someone please tell me if a 1/4 decoder is the same as a 1 to 4 demultiplexer.

In fact, doing \\\"man X\\\" on pretty much any X11 machine will tell you:       The X Consortium requests that the following names  be  used      when referring to this software:                                    X                            X Window System                              X Version 11                      X Window System, Version 11                                  X11  There is no such thing as \\\"X Windows\\\" or \\\"X Window\\\", despite the repeated misuse of the forms by the trade rags.  This probably tells you something about how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAME of the window system right, why should one trust anything else they have  to say?  With regard to dialup X11 implementations, there are several.  You can buy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies, including both  GraphOn and NCD.  (In fact, I'm composing this from an NCD running X11 over serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.)    NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is NCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such  software packages available.  X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running X11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and  is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote.   It seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard, there will be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various  sorts of hardware.

It is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the \\\"normal\\\" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in absence of this, laterality can be \\\"random.\\\" People with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong side).   According to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal recessive, which should imply that on average one child in four in a family would be affected. But there may be much more current information on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking about more than one conditiion.

In sum, Ezekiel prophesied that the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of people living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.  This doesn't bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used differently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes happens that someone says \\\"My grandson is the cutest baby!\\\" and then turns around and sees the granddaughter and says \\\"Oh!  Isn't she the cutest thing!?\\\"  This person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the world according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for first.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very object-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people, nobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is often at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly literally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me, it is not.   Turning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from John E King:   No, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from Ezekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say \\\"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff like that.\\\"  You would read \\\"I will make you a bare rock\\\" and \\\"You will never be rebuilt\\\", and you'd conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way to get from `fishing nets' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large population' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.  In other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the prophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal reading, they could read this passage and conclude \\\"medium-size city\\\".  You seem to feel that \\\"Never be rebuilt\\\" means \\\"be rebuilt\\\" -- maybe so, but it is hardly a `clear implication'.     Well, no.  That's only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I'm from.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington resigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but it's at least a two-horse town.  But supposing 22,000 people is a \\\"small town\\\" -- it's still 22,000 people MORE than Ezekiel predicted.   And you've said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel predicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their valuables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29 Ezekiel even quotes God as saying \\\"he and his army got no reward from the campaign he led against Tyre.\\\"  Let's ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26. Ezekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says that N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.  Regardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before the place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.   *  This post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability to rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.  For example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26 by pulling some \\\"clear implications\\\" out of hat.  When Ezekiel said that N. would \\\"demolish your towers\\\", that clearly implied that the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers used to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would \\\"demolish your fine houses and throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea\\\", that clearly implied that N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N. would \\\"build a ramp up to your walls\\\", that clearly implies that N. would spend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the walls.  See?  A few \\\"clear implications\\\" that are totally contrary to the text, and you can reconcile anything you want. \",\"  Well, dozens of children left the compound between the original BATF assualt and the FBI assault 7 weeks later.

Gay people are and will con- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may be unaware of all the statistica \\\"findings\\\" concerning African-Americans that have been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias against African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances, but there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public scoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case. Fortunately African-Americans had \\\"whites\\\" who supported their 'cause' and public sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was even a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty much legal to discriminate against them.  I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something, that is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society, including gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation and making disciples.  We believe in the Lord's great commandment to Love, and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular to do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes in the commandment of Love (though I'm hard-pressed to find many who actually sho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially within their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian community for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists against the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and treated as runaway slaves for being \\\"nigger-lovers\\\" and such.  I guess I've decided the challenge is worth it.  In my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic story centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight who have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don't know of one case where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject their gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they began to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.  I'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0 raged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values Coalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner support within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more oppressive legisation against gays.  Perhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn't get it in the Middle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousands in witch hunts and inquisitions.  The message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay rights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even hatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't change the results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the final effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a \\\"conditional\\\" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we'll love you. This is sure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an \\\"unconditional\\\" love, one that calls people \\\"just as they are.\\\"  Sure there are things that will 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that need to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things like left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to \\\"other people's expectations.\\\" In the process this coerced conformity causes many people a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their own sense of pseuper-spirituality.  This is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with something very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but I firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation on thier bedrooms.  It's funny that most straight people have successfully removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation, but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society. Gay people are not criminals.  Another interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic church in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self- admitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently been going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were voluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that was how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing happen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends recently told me he was \\\"approached\\\" by someone who is going through the reparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.  These are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not the call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in Colorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over Colorado called \\\"S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T.\\\" (I forget the whole definition off hand, but the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto is \\\"Working for a fag-free America\\\" with an implicit advocation for violence.  This is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are embracing.  We Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression towards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement from organizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good purpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of excluding people.  The Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to \\\"include\\\" people.  I have several of Dr. Martin's books and find them quite helpful, especially concerning 'cults.' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto itself.  Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people to Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?

It is contagious and kills by attacking the covering of the brain, causing the blood vessels to thrombose and the brain to swell up.  It is very treatable if caught in time.  There isn't much time, however.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible to dying from bacterial meningitis.  Any infant with a fever who becomes stiff or lethargic needs to be rushed to a hospital where a spinal tap will show if they have meningitis.  Seizures can also occur.   It can live in the throat of carriers.  Don't worry, you won't get  it from them, especially if they took the medication.  --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\"Are any readers of s.r.c. going to the Love Europe congress in Germany this July?\",\"I have following softwares for sale:  NEW ITEMS (never opened): 1.

Drug use is on the rise among kids as young as eighth graders -     usually 13 - and they're using more LSD and inhalants like glue     and air fresheners, says a new survey.      The annual National High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse finds     \\\"statistically significant increases\\\" in eighth-graders' use of     many drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, crack, LSD and inhalants.      \\\"We may be in danger of losing some ... hard-won ground (in reducing     drug use) as a new, more naive generation of youngsters enters     adolescence,\\\" says Lloyd Johnston, University of Michigan, chief     researcher on the study sponsored by the Department of Health and     Human Services.      But drug use among high school seniors is continuing a decade-long     decline.      The study of 50,000 students shows the percentage who tried the     following in the 30 days before they were polled:          * 8th-graders  - alcohol 26%; cigarettes 16%; marijuana 4%;                          cocaine 0.7%.          * 10th-graders - alcohol 40%; cigarettes 22%; marijuana 8%;                          cocaine 0.7%.          * 12th-graders - alcohol 51%; cigarettes 28%; marijuana 12%;                          cocaine 1.3%.      Among 12th-graders, use of marijuana, cocaine and inhalants     declined over the year before.  Not so with LSD.      * 2% of eighth-graders have tried LSD in the last year, up 24%     over 1991.       * Use of LSD among seniors is at its highest point since 1982; 6%     tried it in the last year.      Reducing drug use among students \\\"requires a different kind of     strategy\\\" that Health Secretary Donna Shalala says will be part     of an overall illness prevention plan.      The survey shows drugs are easier to get and fewer eighth-graders     disapprove of them.      \\\"It's scary,\\\" Shalala says.  \\\"Dealers are focusing on younger, more     vulnerable kids.\\\"   Scott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot\",\"A member of the local BBS I frequent is looking for Mac oriented BBSs based in Chicago.

RBIs and Runs Scored should be banned; all they do is confuse victims of mediot brainwashing like yourself.      You   Uh, so?  You've just explained why we use OBP and SLG to evaluate players. Precisely because the team that scores more runs wins the game. Traditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods which enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored - that's where OBP, SLG, Runs Created, Linear Weights, etc. come in.  These simplify matters so that we can more easily measure a player's offensive contribution to the team's runs scored.  Thank you for making our case.

We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard Scanjet IIp was purchased this week.  Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:  John Sorenson Carol Sigelman Carla Moore Barbara Moose Judith Schrier  Again, thank you to all who gave!  I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to  review the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.   It runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett  Packard Scanners.    When initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options;  (1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3)  automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image.   I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which  parts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.  Once an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The  software gives you two \\\"errors\\\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were  converted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.   Yellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted  correctly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more  credit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue,  you can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal  dictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited,  considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary.   After a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word  processor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a  seperate TIFF or PCX file format.  I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  an Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.   While most of my faxes were received in \\\"standard\\\" mode (200x100 dpi), the  accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent.   Overall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the  limitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just  too small.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has  been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g.,  Escherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus,  Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences  of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera,  malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore,  control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug  resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease,  salmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging  infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those  in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and  minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of  emerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more  effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs  (3).       This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \\\"Emerging Infectious  Diseases.\\\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as  surveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and  public health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation  of an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4).   References  1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation (1) that  identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from  one restaurant chain. Washington       On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of  Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an  increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a  case-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or  postdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls  implicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset  (matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January  18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants  was initiated.       As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January- February 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the  state health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case  definition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS  (Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with  confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of  symptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A  restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients  who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating  a regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17  through January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30  developed HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years  (range: 0-74 years). Idaho       Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health,  Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture- confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December  11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were  hospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13  (93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California       In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was  notified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died.  Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with  E. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993.  Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was  reported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27%  increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January  1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as  postdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured,  or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with  onset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993.       Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The  outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen  persons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median  age of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of  the first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community  controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched  OR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients  who ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular- sized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3).  Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada       On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten  at a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District  issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea  contact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody  diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness  with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with  onset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local  laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools  for E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After  SMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of  one patient 38 days after illness onset.       Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine  were hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range:  0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex- matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during  the week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence  limit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients  also implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7- 49.8). Other Investigation Findings       During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases  primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November  19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \\\"jumbo\\\" patties produced on  November 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11  lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed  to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672  (20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall.       A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the  United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing  the likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter  plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one  slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source.       Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in  families and child day care settings is ongoing.

Editorial Note: E. coli O157:H7 is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium first  identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody  diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). This pathogen has since  emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common  cause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked  most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other  food vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been  implicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter  study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7  that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10  participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a  higher rate than for any other pathogen.       Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most  clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  SMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses  associated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea  (often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups  and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and  complications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients  develop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,  renal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%.       This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community  outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite  the magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in  three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington  (1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from  persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5).  When infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported  to local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public  health action to prevent further cases.       E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can  contaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S.  Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify  critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce  the likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply.  Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with  pathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens  from the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be  internally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook  ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices  are clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played  an important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim  recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to  155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993).       Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report  and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be  consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of  outbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of  this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections  caused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E.  coli O157:H7.

Long-term use of  smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of  oral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who  currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1).  To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products,  CDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease  Prevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing  tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian,  noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This  report summarizes findings from this survey.       The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \\\"Have you used snuff at least 20  times in your entire life?\\\" and \\\"Do you use snuff now?\\\" Similar questions were  asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of  smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco  use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the  time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having  used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the  time of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and  former users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at  least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as  those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not  smoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on  smokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or  equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide  national estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using  standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN)  (3).       In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users  of smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%)  women. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco  use was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was  highest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was  highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of  smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan  Natives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American  Indians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of  smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was  substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in  rural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only  for women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1).       Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those  aged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of  chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although  women rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest  among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years.       An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being  former smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were  former smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons  aged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users  (56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95%  CI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users  was similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5%  95% CI=68.9-78.1).       Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0)  currently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95%  CI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95%  CI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco.       Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3%  95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6- 49.6).   Reported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease  Prevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National  Center for Health Statistics, CDC.   Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless  tobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in  particular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that  link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral  snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this  behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for  nicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4).       Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among  racial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels  and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require  further explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role  in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the  differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6).       In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current  smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the  prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco  users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous  study among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  occasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked  reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to  stop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health  implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use.       The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special  population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless  tobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year  2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more  than 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the  prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless  tobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts,  enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes  commensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to  routinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based  prevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit  tobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).

Good luck with your desiscion.   \",\" I became aware of the claim years ago.  So I decided to check it out, on my own.  But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some  references.  See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where  Lane Fox writes, \\\"... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus'  career] is agreed to be a Christian addition.\\\"  In my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21 April 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine  Pagel's _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  \\\"A comment *attributed* to Josephus reports ... [emphasis mine]\\\".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention the two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.  So far as I can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things:  1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the long passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory.  I don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are orginally developed (does anyone?).  Biblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The former, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and ideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I  didn't elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to incorporate theology).  Can't say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before  Gutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one  hand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any, because anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is  certainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have  the two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic  ms.

I should probably leave this alone, but what the heck...   But didn't he credit the actual flag design to a party member - some dentist or other? I believe he gives such credit in Mein Kampf.   Well, I'm no expert, but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this. They make reference to several scandals that occurred long before \\\"the night of the long knives\\\". The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of the SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name escapes me at the moment) called \\\"Homosexuals in History\\\" asserts that Roehm and Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm's SA circle.   Well, you're the one who is in Germany. If you don't believe the history books, look up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not have access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of documented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the \\\"knight of the long knives\\\" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping together, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA's homosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I've  read make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me.    I know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do you know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have read concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that  all historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about  homosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don't you think they  would have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals? I would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one  should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case.    If you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving), then the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where the stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to archival material - most people on the net are not.   Eh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so that you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis might have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is true? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?  I don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were homosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious for its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German govt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser's friends were prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long tradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history - back to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a  product of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the English public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality, would have been quite willing to overlook Roehm's homosexuality.  In addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The Hitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various  pre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote  homoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So  it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis,  regardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the \\\"evils\\\" of homosexuality. Why should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all  societies - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.  No, I don't have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you will accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access  to these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern homosexuality that I have ever read - I don't have the time. Nothing is stopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove otherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.\",\"  This is an excellent question and I'll be anxious to see if there are any such cases.  I doubt it.  In the medieval period (esp. 10th-cent. when Aquinas flourished) argument was a useful tool because everyone \\\"knew the rules.\\\"  Today, when you can't count on people knowing even the basics of logic or seeing through rhetoric, a good argument is often indistinguishable from a poor one.  Sorry; just one of my perennial gripes...<:->  Ken\",\"        If you happen to know a political position which does not have people advocating it who do more harm than good, please point it out.                 One of the advantages and draw-backs of requiring proof on the part of the government before they may take action against citizens.  (and part of the reason some of us believe weapons should be available.)          We are not arguing the absolute sanctity of the U.S. Constitution.  In fact, the fillibuster we're talking about isn't *in* the Constitution.  I objected to your suggestion that the Senate wasn't intended to exercise the power it was clearly given.          I'll point out again that Reagan only had a Republican Majority in the Senate during his first term, and his coalition in the House came apart at about the same time.  Bush never had any real support in Congress.         The real point is that everybody, *everywhere* got their pork, from the big corporations to the guy I saw last night leaving a convenience store with an armful of junk-food he'd bought with food stamps.  (He spent more in food stamps on junk than I *make* in a week and I'm not on government assitance.)          Lessee, let's pull out the old Almanac.         In 1980, total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billion dollars.  In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase of approx. 884 billion dollars.         In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars.  In 192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars. That leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccounted for.  (This represented an increase of 230%)         In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs, Housing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare) cost 86.5 billion dollars.  In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, or more than national defense started.  (This represented an increase of 230%)         In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars on Medicare.  In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars.  (an increase of 368%)         In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housing credits and subsidies of that like.  In 1992 it was 87 billion.         In 1980, Health care services and research was 23 billion dollars.  In 1992, it was 94 billion dollars.         Agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion.         Science, up 11 billion to 16 billion.         Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion.         Education up 14 billion to 45 billion.         Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion.         Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion.              About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under  the Energy category, primarily under \\\"Supply,\\\" and \\\"Community Development,\\\" in the area of \\\"disaster relief,\\\" and between the two of them represent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars.         Where *was* this huge diversion?          Not that's a stretch.  If the current government was pushed by the President to create this mess, wouldn't one expect it to begin to equalize once the pressure is gone?          Only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want to continue. I see very little positive about it.          The Constitution was *designed* to frustrate the democratic process, so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting what they wanted by the time it happened.  Nor do I see putting the brakes on the \\\"democratic process\\\" an inherently bad thing.  Califronia's riding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense it gets worse.          Sometimes, or perhaps most of the time, the people should be told, \\\"no,\\\" and pointed to their local government.                 Phill, would you do me the very great favor of repeating that in talk.politics.guns?          Cute.  We can eliminate violations of the law by eliminating the law.          Free speech alone is dangerous, Phill.          OK, Phill.  All you gotta show me is a clear pattern of *reduction* in homicide rates across several countries and that'll be it.  (Not current, mind, you, reduction.)            Who's chaining anything to freedom of speech?  By *calling* it a freedom?            Phill, you're a master of subtly changing the subject.  I haven't *based* my argument against raw democracy on the Constitution.  I've tried to explain why it isn't a good idea.  The only time I've referred to the Constitution is to point out it doesn't contain the restrictions on the veto and the Senate you appear to believe were \\\"meant,\\\" but just didn't make it in there.              The Constitution doesn't *contain* the 41% fillibuster rule. I only believe that the rule is a good idea.  You cn't dismiss that as venerating the Constitution because it isn't *in* the Constitution.\",\" Um, I hate to break this to you, but article numbers are unique per site. They have no meaning on other machines.   You mean the responses some of which pointed to double-blind tests which show no such \\\"chinese restaurant effect\\\" unique to MSG (it's elicited by the placebo as well.)   Like youself?  Someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to do with the use of this substance in human nutrition?   No, it's undisputed in the literature that glutamate is an amino acid which is an excitatory neurotransmitter.  There is also evidence that excessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain conditions like stroke, drowning and Lou Gehrig's disease, just to name a few. This is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid in foods.  People are not receiving intra-ventricular injections of glutamate.   I don't know about premier, but it's certainly an important one.   Sez you.  Such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any controlled studies.  Infant mice and other models are useful as far as they go, but they're not relevant to the matter at hand.  Which is not to say that I favor its use in things like baby food--a patently ridiculous use of the additive.  But we have no reason to believe that MSG in the diet effects humans adversely.   Wrong.  Do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink? Milligrams worth.  Compare that to a glass of milk.  Do you know how much glutamate is present in most protein-containing foods compared to that added by the use of MSG?

During the second  Imlach era, when Darryl Sittler was called a \\\"cancer on the team\\\", he tore the C off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain.  Sittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly captaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittler's friend) Bobby Clarke.  Instead, Sittler got traded to Detroit.  Rick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and they took the captaincy away from him.  Then he was traded to Chicago.  During Doug Carpenter's tenure as Leaf coach, in an  attempt  to  kiss the  ass of a sulking Gary Leeman, the Leafs took the A away from Brad Marsh to give to Leeman.  Leeman wouldn't take it and when they  tried to give it back to Marsh, he wouldn't take it neither.  The best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman, late of the Senators.  While he was in Philadelphia, Bobby Clarke, arguably one of the great captains of all time, was bumped up to the status  of playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy.  Bridgman be- came the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a captain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the players.  The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of  making sure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full.   -- \",\" This may be a safety issue; the CSA is more paranoid in certain areas than UL and such.

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and  Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses  each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin  June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours  per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.   Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact  Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below.   ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO  UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.        ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## #######################################################################               JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon  University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific  communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and  January 1994.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the  United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is  facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.   PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to  develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:  1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time.  2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in  manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a  variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or  research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.   3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,  participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.   FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

Brendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17 seconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals. Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good goaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the stretch to preserve the Blues lead.  The Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and taking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty on Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the blue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired a long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After the goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks 10-9 in the first period.  Jeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on the left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown collected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.  Two minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a short-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy Roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass across the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.  Noonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1. Stephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat Stephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan deflected the puck in the net.  Denny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the rebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for the shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards to Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues outshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.  With the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked up a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith was called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.  The Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into the two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot, and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and passed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp angle.  Just 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson Emerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with two Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the slot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.  The Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph made some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy Murray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game. The Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held on to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period, totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent in the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on on four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in the league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play.   The game was carried live on ABC, the first time an NHL game other than an All-Star game has been shown on network television since May 24, 1980, when CBS carried Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals.  The best-of-seven series continues Wednesday in Chicago and Friday and Sunday in St. Louis.

Being a PhD-student at David Chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.  The report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be retrieved from  ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)  from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA. The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.  ==================================================================== ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the representation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier systems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in both computation and communication complexity than any such system proposed previously.    Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability. Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the Diffie-Hellman problem.     Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in previously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the first place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender after the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user, which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems. Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by a simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that previous solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system can be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while retaining its computational efficiency. ====================================================================  Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!    I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as possible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to me and I will try to reply as good as I can. Any comments are also welcome!  Stefan Brands, \",\" xgif is the grandfather of XV.  -- \",\" In myopia the cornea is too curved.  There is too much of a bulge in the center.

To get multiple accelerators on a single menu item I'd do something like:   *menuItem.accelerators: #override \\\\n\\\\   Ctrl<Key>M: fire() \\\\n\\\\   Shift<Key>L: fire() \\\\n  The accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would automatically see a \\\"Ctrl M\\\" show up in your menuItem object.

It took place in the first intermission of game 1 of the Montreal-Quebec series.   Pre-game comments ----------------- Don's pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies... The goalie who gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series for his team.  Eposode Summary --------------- This episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that he bought from the concession stand.  Ron Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the Toronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow and proclaimed \\\"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks of me. Beauty.\\\"  Next, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to him, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all the arenas in the NHL.  From there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game had great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game in the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All stop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary by Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most penalties gets to ref in the finals.  Next, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for the Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the wins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup and the AHL championships.  Finally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the Rangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved. Don feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had several key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who went cold.  Don had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party's over, Adolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer be a 'country club'.... \\\"NY should be achamed of themselves... If they go in the tank with Adolf there, they'll be hanging from the yardarm by their thumbs.\\\"   Rating ------ Nothing too special in this episode.

Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in any ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference power, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which should also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms in an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted notation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of the circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude* (rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted reference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB. So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation such as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.  For power:    dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )  For amplitude    dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )  'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base 10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel. It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for the common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation convention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.  Common references for audio are:   0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms  0 dBV = 1 volt   0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)  0 VU = -10dBV (consumer gear line level)   Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using the rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application or moment.  Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear impedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the power will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done with the above two identities and ohm's law.  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin   Phone: (205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking    (205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

I was responding to the sweet blithe statement in:  <rick.734610425@digibd> from rick@digibd.digibd.com (Rick Richardson)  rick> This is one area where Microsoft NT has a big advantage.  Since rick> they control the whole show, there are no issues like this where rick> licensees create incompatible defacto standards.  This happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when they are pleased with something that works, and they believe that others will also be happy to use it.  I remember when _SunView_ was hot stuff (and am not, by that statement, endorsing Sun and its products, this is just my experience), and when OpenWindows became hot stuff, that was when I started hearing, as mentioned before, the \\\"socialistic masses\\\" that were bent on destroying  _anything_ that was deemed proprietary, including OpenWindows.  I mentioned Motif in the same breath, because that is what Sun has decided to turn its attention to, not because I hate it.  Mr. Richardson's position, I believe, is a healthy one, and I am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to flame and destroy NT, if it ever shows up, wanting instead everything to be free, and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are  no de facto standards.  It was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds.\",\" A Sea Doo is a boat. It turns by changing the angle of the duct behind the propeller.

This is the same anti-gun police chief that wanted full-auto Uzis for his patrol cars...).  Perhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago's finest, a close-to- 100% reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99% reliable automatic. I note that in Germany, where certainly the 9mm semi-auto handgun is king, some of the more elite police types want revolvers.  I don't think the issue is cost, because Chicago police certainly make on the order of at least $40K/year.   Your presumption of \\\"disadvantage\\\" I think is not borne out by the experiences of New York City's cops; there the cops usually come out on top with their standard .38 Spl revolvers.  I've seen S&Ws, Rugers and Beretta 9mms in addition to the revolvers carried by Chicago cops.... in the past, I've seen .45 M1911s; others have seen Browning Hi-Powers...\",\"  Not necessarily.  It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road splits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence. There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and Alomar is not a home run hitter.   Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up with ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.  Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.  Regarding the A vs. B argument, I'll just say they're both very good players with different strengths and a bright future. \",\" No, they fold on the dotted line.

 No, the 6551A is able to operate in a 2 MHz system, the 6551 can only take 1 MHz without problems.  If you see a 8551 made by MOS or CSG, take it, its a 6551A.   I know no fixed version of the 6551. There are different possibilities to work around this bug. The easiest is to tie _CTS to GND and use _DSR or _DCD as _CTS. It should be easy to fix the software, _DSR is bit 6 and DCD ist bit 5 of the Status Register (Read 6551 with RS1 = low and RS0 = high).  Using the _CTS-line can lead into big trouble. The 6551 _instantly_ stops transmission if _CTS goes high. This means, that you may get only a half byte...

About 20 years ago, _National Lampoon_ had some comic strips  in them that were drawn by Neal Adams. They were called \\\"Son o' God\\\" comics.  It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible. In the comic, there were a  group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn, and when one of them said  the magic word, he turned into \\\"Son o' God.\\\" He went from a myopic,  curly headed, yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied  portraits of Jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile  features.    Now, if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus,  and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this  NatLamp Jesus, we would have to say that this was fallacious since  this Jesus was a fabrication, and did not really exist.   This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim  that they are Christian. They profess faith in Jesus, but the Jesus  that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the  NatLamp Jesus was. \",\"I have heard some impressive things about Hijakk (for Windows).

April 6, 1993  RELEASE:  93-64          Dr.  John H.  Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.          A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.          Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.          Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.          Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give \\\"full consideration\\\" to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.          To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.          Gibbons reiterated that, \\\"President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\\\"          NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.\",\"FOR SALE:  *** COMPLETE PACKAGE ONLY ***  (1) COMMODORE C64 COMPUTER LIKE NEW IN THE BOX WITH POWER SUPPLY     AND OWNERS MANUALS  (2) COMMODORE 1541C DISK DRIVE LIKE NEW IN THE BOX - AND OWNERS     MANUAL (3) COMMODORE 1702 COLOR MONITOR LIKE NEW AND OWNERS MANUAL  (4) PANASONIC KXP-1091 DOT MATRIX PRINTER LIKE NEW AND OWNERS     MANUAL (5) PRINTER INTERFACE FOR PANASONIC PRINTER (6) FASTLOAD CARTRIDGE (7) HUGE STACK OF BOOKS ON C-64/1541 PROGRAMMING   MAKE A REASONABLE OFFER AND I'LL THROW IN 300+ DISKS OF SOFTWARE...

Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of  Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population and presented to  the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian civilization.  All reliable Western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly people of  Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the  Ottoman Empire between 1914-1920.  It is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators of the Nazis during World War II and that, even today, criminal/Nazi members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate racism, hatred, violence and terrorism among peoples.   And x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following  ways:  1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility.  2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism  Triangle and criminal/Nazi Armenians, attempts to call into question the  veracity of the Turkish Genocide.  3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to  silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.  4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.  Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian government  is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.  Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle  of those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and  consequently a number of governments and organizations have become  supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.

Anyway...)   The basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption of Mary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles  and all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were present when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days later, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was still unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There was no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed that Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their   preaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently  considered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the apostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of the assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.\",\"Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part02 Last-modified: 1993/4/15   FAQ for sci.crypt, part 2: Net Etiquette  This is the second of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here? * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt? * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?   * What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?    Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always   make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.   You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same   newsgroup. After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the   readers want to see.  * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?    No. In fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were   created exactly so that political questions like ``Should RSA be   patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. Many   sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,   comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of   people who don't care about those other topics, try to put your   postings in the right group.    Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic   ``spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either.  * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?    ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here's some   ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a   doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.    If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some   ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by   random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the   opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is   distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some   systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts   and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but   this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most   sci.crypt readers won't bother with.    So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,   find out if it's really new. Look through this FAQ for references and   related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the   introductory textbooks.    When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at   large, try to break it yourself! You shouldn't waste the time of tens   of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily   answered on your own.    If you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some   reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your   system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to   sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated   in some areas.)    If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.   You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted   cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break   Snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. If you don't have enough   experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will   be able to find a flaw. If this happens, it's your responsibility to   consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more   layer of complication and come back for another round.    A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA   look at it. A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope   of this FAQ.\",\"  While I do not speak for Peter Tattam, I am fairly sure he is planning a  Winsock compliant version.

My head (helmeted) hit the pavement with a \\\"clunk\\\", leaving a couple of dings and chips in the paint at the point of impact, but no other visible damage.  I called the helmet manufacturer and inquired about damage.  They said that the way a fiberglass shell works is to first give, then delaminate, then crack. This is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a wider area.  After the fiberglass has done its thing, the crushable foam liner takes care of absorbing (hopefully) the remaining impact force. They told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality (delamination of the glass/resin layers) can occur with NO visible signs, either inside or outside of the helmet.  They suggested that I send them the helmet and they would inspect it (including X-raying).  I did so.  They sent back the helmet with a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would compromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection. (I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim prior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.)  The bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integrity can be compromised with no visible signs.  The only way to know for sure is to send it back and have it inspected.  Note that some helmet manufacturers provide inspections services and some do not.  Another point to consider when purchasing a lid. \",\"   I think that you are changing the meaning of \\\"values\\\" here. Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.  value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in  usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus.  The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound.   In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing.  In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the word \\\"value\\\" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as \\\"objective values.\\\"  Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow. Just because the word \\\"values\\\" is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts.  If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  So, back to the original question:  And objective morality is.....?  If you can provide an objective foundation for \\\"morality\\\" then that will be a good beginning. \",\" I hope I didn't award custody, Rich.  I purposely used \\\"handle\\\" in order to  avoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are aberrations like \\\"scientific\\\" creationism).  I used \\\"best\\\" in part to indicate  that science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are mostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the matter.  As an aside, for science I should have written \\\"how and when\\\".  Nobody seems to argue over what.   Seems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I'm not trying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works. On the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which you know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological perspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I  think the masses can't get along without religion.  Not that generally they are  incapable; they just don't, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to  be the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore  it seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for  dispensing answers to \\\"who and why\\\".  I suggest that this holds regardless of  the \\\"truth\\\" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.   In the end, spiritual beliefs are just as \\\"real\\\" as scientific facts and  explanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).     No.  In fact, I don't think it is closed now, at least for some individuals.  Isn't there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was  created from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might  presuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued  that something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn't have to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that's a tough one for people today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not  explanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words,  I agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific  as explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but  I sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will  be necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty  convoluted here; I hope I've made sense.     I agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how,  when, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment,  reason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when,  and not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the  naturalists' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely  leaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and the arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.    Much obliged.  Funny how facts tend to muddle things, isn't it?

Roy was the reason the game was tied... and that would *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool.  Hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ... Both Dionne's and Bellows' shots were misplayed by Hextall, but just because his gaffes were early in the game, no one seems to care. Roy stood on his head  for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from  end-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by  Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall  for most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero  because Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities.  Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very  well, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over  Bellows' stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all  those opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them. Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ...    Sure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against an explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.   I disagree. Roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole night.  The defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic, Nolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.   This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities, as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.   And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. Roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5, when you consider the defense, or lack of one, that played in front of him for most of the season.   The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans. Why should they read the papers? They played 58 minutes of \\\"Burnsian\\\" hockey to shut down Quebec. All they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the  extra 2.  Red Light to face Quebec...rubbish. That's a guaranteed way to end the series 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ? The fans, the media, and Racicot, perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team.   If you mean the goal should never have gone in, because there should never have been an OT, then I agree. But the goal itself was a great piece of work by Young. Roy had both the near and far posts covered, but Young flipped the puck up under Roy's arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all.\",\"    We're looking at a series of chips by WSI, the PSD3xx series.

Charley,  I can't help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your previous posts.  I submit that you don't answer them because you cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic, and I once again challenge you to prove me wrong.  To make the task as easy for you as possible, I'll present concise re-statements of some of the questions that you have failed to answer, in the hope that you may address them one at a time for all to see.  Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period, I will re-post this article, with suitable additions and deletions, at such time that I notice a post by you on another topic.  I will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or you cease to post to this newsgroup.  I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these questions previously and your answer missed my notice.  If you can be kind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles, I will be only too pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question, and remove it from this list.  Now, to the questions...  1. After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating that you weren't referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some atheists who you feel don't fit your patterns, to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your stereotype?  Here is the context for the question:    2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that \\\"senses and reason are all we have to go by\\\", and when pressed, you have implied that we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and reason.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...   then later...   then later...    3.  You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by a.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical.  I asked you to identify one such claim that I have made.  You have failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical?  If so, please repeat them.  Here is the context for the question:    then later...    4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the \\\"axioms\\\" of reason that one couldn't help but become atheist.  I asked you to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that I have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer the question.  Please do so now.  Question: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become atheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that effect?  If you don't retract that claim, do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism?  Here is the context for the question:  [First quote] [Second quote]   5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer these Challenges because they contained too much in the way of \\\"included text\\\" from previous posts.  Later, you implied that you wouldn't respond because I was putting words in your mouth.  Please clarify this seeming contradiction.  Question:  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context from your own posts, or that I paraphrase your positions in order to avoid \\\"included text\\\"?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...

I certify that these were completed before the first pitch. :-)  AL East 1.  New York Yankees - the most (only?) improved team in this division 2.  Toronto Blue Jays - Stewart and Morris?  No way. 3.  Milwaukee Brewers - they always seem to do better than I expect 4.  Baltimore Orioles - Pitching, but Devareaux, Anderson, and Hoiles will drop 5.  Cleveland Indians - Still don't seem to know what they are doing 6.  Detroit Tigers - All key players but Fryman are another year past peak 7.  Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than 7th  Al West - this division was the toughest for me to pick.  Whoever of the top           4 gets pitching should win it. 1.  Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success 2.  Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here.  Jose Canseco? 3.  Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching. 4.  Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close 5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here 6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs 7.  California Angels - will win no games  NL East 1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach! 2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga 3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected 4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a \\\"team\\\" 5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me 6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing 7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doing  NL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division. 1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern 2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all 3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 2 4.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 1993 5.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants 6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink 7.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL.   NLCS  Montreal d.

Madness.  /* Written  4:34 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */ /* ---------- \\\"From Israeli press. Madness.\\\" ---------- */ FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.  Paper: Zman Tel Aviv (Tel Aviv's time). Friday local Tel Aviv's paper, affiliated with Maariv.  Date: 19 February 1993  Journalist: Guy Ehrlich  Subject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan (Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate within the occupied territories.  Excerpts from the article:  \\\"A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as Arabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is that everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one way or another insane\\\".  A man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name is known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be called Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to depart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different from average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service. But in their souls, one can notice something completely different....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them. And they think that to most of their fellows from the Cherry it woundn't be easy either. Yet after they began to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking. The following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness.  (...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in which some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We called such soldiers H.I. 'Hit by the Intifada'. Under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common phenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I should talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On Fridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to until I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The keys of my father's car must be ready for in advance, so that I can go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don't want them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it instantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only there I become normal.(...)  (...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother. It was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how exactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began to laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh straight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov cocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as they deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with the effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I was delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the Arab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit him straight in his ass. We both felt that we'd pulled off something.  Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab, blood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: 'Shut up' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed straight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at something convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: 'All right, wait a moment'. I left him in order to take a look at another wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be saved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all this to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight into my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt I was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over her head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn't know what to say.  (...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a field. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend shot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the hill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it. We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two deer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully inspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We had hit'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too, so as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like beasts of prey. We couldn't explain what had happened to us. We were almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we felt the whole day very badly.  (...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in. This is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may be for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel Godlike of sorts.\\\"  (...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any security-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. 'Why shouldn't I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ? Why shouldn't I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver while being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suits me perfectly. I have no human emotions any more. If I get a reasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to Bosnia in order to fight there.\\\"\",\"  Maybe in the 60's, but not now.  Steel is a dead industry in Pgh.

Since there are two possible processor configurations and one of the them doesn't have an FPU it does seem to be an option, even though it really isn't.       Well, then allow me to end your confusion. The C650 ONLY come with an LC040 in the base 4/80 configuration. If you are not getting this configuration then you are getting an FPU.       Good question. I have been wondering that since Feb. 10th.        This is possible, but an option is something that you are supposed to be able to request when you want it. What Apple has done is given the buyer a CHOICE between configurations and not an OPTION.       This is not unclear at all. In fact Apple has included in the ROMs of those machines with LC040s code to recognize the presence of the full 040's FPU and use it. Thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching chips. You pop the LC040 out and pop in a full '040.       They did? I think I would double-check this. It has been stated countless times in this newsgroup by two of the Centris hardware designers that the LC040 and the full '040 are pin compatible and that the C610 can be upgraded to a full '040.\",\" I think it is an ESDI controller if you need the doco i can help you.

The New Testament does not quote Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Ruth, Job, Ecclesiastes, or Song of Songs, just as it does not quote from the Deuterocanon.  But if the non-quotation of the former does not disqualify them, neither does the non-quotation of the later.  And the Wisodm of Solomon was quite clearly an influence on St. Paul, especially in the letter to the Romans (cf especially Romans 1.18-32 and Wisdom 13-14).  [stuff deleted]    True.  Not all accepted them as Scripture, though niether were all the books of the New Testament so accepted, which puts to the lie the whole argument of the books being excluded because they were debated and not universally accepted.  Hebrews, the Apocalypse, 2 Peter, Esther, and others were debated at various times, but eventually retained.  As for the Codexes you mention, both Vaticanus and Sinaitcus include the Deuterocanon, bothe of the New and Old Testaments, and Vaticanus (I think) inlcudes 1 Clement, the Shepard of Hermas, and the Epistle of Baranabas.  As for the Muratorian Canon, it deals with the New Testament only, though it is very valuable in its witness to those books.     You're not wrong!  It is a `tradition of men' to exlcude them, as I will explain below.  \\\"That nothing be read in the Church under the nmae of Divine Scripture, except the canonical Scriptures, and the canoncial Scriptures are - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Four books of Kingdoms [being 1&2 Samuel and 1&2 Kings], Two books of Paralpomenon [being 1&2 Chronicles], Job, the Psalter of David, the Five books of Solomon [being Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of Solomon, and [misatributed to him] the Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach], The books of the Twelve (Minor) Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah [being Jeremiah, the Lamentations, Baruch, and the Letter, all of which were formerly counted as one], Ezekiel, Daniel, Tobit, Judith, Esther, Two books of Ezra [being Ezra and Nehemiah], Two books of Maccabees.

(Though the Episcopalians hold them in high regard and read them in the Church, they are not counted as Scripture by them, and may not be used to prove dogma.  The Lutherans hold out similarly.)  Earlier mention of the so-called Apocrypha as divine scripture can also be found, and below I inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling it divine scripture that could be found among the writings of the Fathers.  \\\"And this is the reason why the Law of the old Testament is reckoned as consisting of twenty-two books: so that they may correspond to the number of letters [in the Hebrew alphabet]....

I own a turbocharged one, and I would never buy a turbocharged vehicle unless I knew the owner and his/her driving/maintenance habits.   I have been wondering about that myself.  The '90 AWD models and the '91s were identical (except for the ABS option).     Yes.  Some owners had problems with the transaxles.  Using synthetic lubricants in the transaxles solved the problem in most cases.  The problem was not unique to the AWDs, however.  It was common to all models.  The Galant VR4 and GSX had the same transaxle, but I didn't see those listed in CR.   I don't know of any major complaints in this area, except that the battery that was installed at the factory had a low current rating.    The first FWD models (those built before May 1989) were recalled for brake upgrades.  Some FWD and AWD owners had problems with warped rotors.  Those of us who insist on using manual torque wrenches every time the lug nuts are tightened have never had a problem.   I can refer you to someone who has gone through a set of pads in one day!  It all depends on how you drive.  It seems that most owners have been getting between 40-70k on a set of pads.   First time I hear about a problem with the valve train on these cars, other than timing belt failures.   If your friend \\\"beats\\\" on the car, then his unit is not a representative sample of the car's reliability.

I was one, I guess that I always steered a bicycle that way, and I only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding *after* the course. I could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem, but I only started using it in my normal riding when I decided that my turning at speed (off-ramps and the like) was a lot more difficult that it should have been. I knew how it works (although that's currently up for debate) definitely knew *that* it works, as I could do it in swerves, but only figured it out later in my normal riding. Just a data point. I think that it's not a bad idea to bring the idea up, but it's best to let everyone tuchus-steer for the first lesson or two, so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry about proper handlebar technique.

It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about. If only those christian \\\"scientists\\\" would take note.  (In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian  scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics.  For example, there are a few chaps who are  trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed  light has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been  accounted for. :-] )   Or (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never  intended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one up?   Millions of people have \\\"died for a lie\\\".  This  point is difficult to  substantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments work in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed  themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.     That is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone) to become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to the claim that Jesus was the \\\"real thing\\\".    Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the point, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based  (I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with  his principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler was sane....      Hmmm.... I don't think his arguments warrant the use of a \\\"Therefore...\\\"   This is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or she will end up in all sorts of shit.     Tony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone,  who thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say \\\"a is equal to b because a is equal to b\\\".       That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed  in religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be correct.    It   I think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flames than here :-).

BUT the slight problem with this, which makes the solution less than idea, is that the trace utility spits out many more points than are necessary to define the shapes being traced.  Straight lines and curves are both traced as many short segments.  So... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to image.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?  A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability      of these products.         \",\" .  .  .  Since I was born in the late Pleistocene, I too remember 1964.

Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring and tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener and LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.

Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets dropped across that 600ohms.  That's fine until you're down to roughly 12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.

Some people do not think about it at all and merely follow their impulses. I claim that is just as dangerous as \\\"following authority\\\". I could site sexually transmitted diseases, drug abuse, all manner of criminal activity, the savings and loan scandal, car accidents, eggs thrown at my house, all are examples of people not \\\"following authority\\\". I could easily argue that in the evil examples you gave the  problem was a leader not following _his_ authority and doing what  he wanted. Of course, where is the top of the chain? Therein lies  our search.    I don't think it's as simple as you are claiming. \\\"Pressing need\\\" is ambiguous. Should I recycle or not?    Realize that I have four kids who, despite being very precocious  of course, are very tiring with their constant lack of understanding the tremendous knowledge I wish to impart to them.   Ahh! An ironic ending.   The irony I was implying in my initial pithy retort to the bumper  sticker cliche \\\"Question Authority\\\" was that I was questioning  the authority of the person telling me to question authority. It seems there is a certain segment of society that finds meaning only in being different, only in rebelling, forsaking everything for the sake of freedom. I question their integrity and fortitude.  There is another freedom that comes from doing a task correctly. Different people are at different levels of development in different areas. Part of the challenge of life is to find the right authorities to follow, we can't know everything about everything. Often  when learning a new skill or subject I will follow the teacher, perhaps blindly. Only when I have learned enough to ask appropriate questions should I question him, only when I have developed my skills enough should I challenge him. Once again, how do I know when I get to those stages?  If you have to be told to question authority, perhaps you shouldn't.\",\"       TRIAD, the first drag-free satellite, was designed and built by the  Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched 2 Sept 1972.  The  satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section  housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof  mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The  proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation  pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered  around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.       TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The  2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a  single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be  powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).       Further info on TRIAD, DISCOS, etc. can be found in \\\"Spacecraft Design  Innovations in the APL Space Department,\\\" Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest,  Vol. 13, No. 1 (1992).\",\" I'm really surprised Clinton hasn't already tried to do this.

Some reported pincushioning   (the problem I had), others poor focus, etc, etc.  I complained about mine and it was 're-tuned' (I dodn't even pay shipping) and returned to me in 2 days.   It's now clear, well-focussed and has no pincushioning or barrel distortion at all. I'm very happy with it, and the digital controls and mode memory are nice.

It is an LC, with 10MB of RAM and an 80MB internal drive, running system 7.1, with a few SCSI devices in a (so far as I know) properly terminated chain.  I had shut down the system for a day-- I was out of town and we sometimes have thunderstorms this time of year-- and upon restarting got a blinking question mark.  I booted from a floppy and saw that my external HD seemed okay, but there was no sign of the internal.  I installed a system folder on the external and was, indeed, able to boot from it.  I tried things like Disk First Aid and Silverlining, to inquire about the internal drive.  They either could not find it or got errors in trying to talk to it. (Silverlining claimed it was a Connor drive, but it is a Quantum... )  Well, I'd backed things up, so I was able to work.  But, at some point I noticed that the internal had reappeared.  Now, Disk First Aid says that all's well, etc.  Things seem to be fine.  But, what happened?  Was this a warning that something (the internal HD or something else) is about to die?  I'm definitely nervous.  And, if this is a signal that the internal HD is sick, is it true that I can only put up to a 127MB drive inside an LC?  Some folks have claimed there's a limitation in the LC (other'n size or power) while others (and that includes LaCie, over the phone) say anything that fits is okay.\",\"Hey Serdar,            What are you retarded?\",\"I've been running a daily summary of the Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial from here in Boise.

It would, however,  be rather cruel and/or sadistic to believe that such a place exists  and then remain quiet about it.    The only scenario I can envision in which dimished respect would be justified is if Jesus knew there was no such place as hell, and spoke about it anyway, just to scare people.

The lunar-orbit mission was an afterthought, after Hagoromo (a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hiten during a lunar flyby) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion into lunar orbit couldn't be positively confirmed.  It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages.  It takes a long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit. If you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit, you do have to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel, although it is reduced from what you'd need for the brute-force approach.\",\" Rutin is a bioflavonoid, compounds found (among other places) in the rinds of citrus fruits.  These have been popular, especially in Europe, to treat \\\"capillary fragility\\\", and seemingly in even more extreme cases-- a few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he'd had hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously, I asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active ingredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical sputtering.  I have no idea how he's doing hemorrhoid-wise these days. The studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in human disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the reports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.  This stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there's little risk of trying it, but I wouldn't expect much of a result. \",\"It would be nice to think that individuals can somehow 'beat the system' and like a space explorer, boldly go where no man has gone before and return with a prize cure. Unfortunately, too often the prize is limited and the efficacy of the 'cure' questionable when applied to all sufferers.  This applies to both medical researchers and non-medical individuals. Just because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some use does not make the next cure-all. What about the dozens of individuals who have courageously participated in clinical trials? Did they have any guarentee of cures? Are they any less because they didn't trumpet their story all over the world?  As a parting note, wasn't there some studies done on Gingko seeds for Meniere's?

 (lots of stuff about the Nicene Creed deleted which can be read in the   original basenote.  I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to   take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive   word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS    netters will be amiable in their explanation.)  Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say \\\"no good\\\" because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not  the authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time  before I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England,  Professor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the  following as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring  1993 edition):    \\\"I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--   or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other    with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian    or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around   a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude   those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central   defining characteristic of a good American might be \\\"one who doesn't draw   exclusive circles\\\" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the    central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to   draw a circle around \\\"Mormon\\\" or \\\"Christian,\\\" to decide who is \\\"orthodox\\\"   and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider   that the central pillar of Christ's \\\"orthodoxy\\\" is our ability to love   unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.    \\\"I recently spent some time in a \\\"Christian\\\" bookstore in California. The   service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and   well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural   commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.   But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking    others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American   culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to \\\"Cults and the   Occult,\\\" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same   rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found   I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers   (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous   anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations   of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).    \\\"It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to   Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (\\\"Perfect   love casteth out fear,\\\" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the   LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a    disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the   same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive   action---as the \\\"religious right wing\\\" has launched this year against the   political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like.   It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the   very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,   if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of   others they believe to be evil.\\\"   The above \\\"sermon\\\" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe to This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His arms.    Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles  of the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim  perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do  now lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled \\\"Christian\\\", if  those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are  intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical  scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication  than mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the  majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective  voice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter  the LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths  and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to  disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves.

Serdar Argic\",\" This is a good point, but I think \\\"average\\\" people do not take up Christianity so much out of fear or escapism, but, quite simply, as a way to improve their social life, or to get more involved with American culture, if they are kids of immigrants for example.  Since it is the overwhelming major religion in the Western World (in some form or other), it is simply the choice people take if they are bored and want to do something new with their lives, but not somethong TOO new, or TOO out of the ordinary.  Seems a little weak, but as long as it doesn't hurt anybody...    These are good quotes, and I agree with both of them, but let's make sure to alter the scond one so that includes something like \\\"...let him be, as long as he is not preventing others from finding their peace.\\\" or something like that.  (Of course, I suppose, if someone were REALLY \\\"at peace\\\", there would be no need for inflicting evangelism)   Well, it is a sure thing we will have to live with them all our lives.  Their popularity seems to come and go.  I remember when I first entered High School, I was an atheist (always had been) and so were about 7 of my friends.  At this time, 5 of those 7 have converted, always to Christianity (they were all also immigrants from Taiwan, or sons of immigrants, hence my earlier gross generalization).  Christianity seems a lot more popular to people now than it ever has before (since I've been noticing).  Maybe it is just my perceptions that are chagning.  Who knows? I for one am perfectly willing to live and let live with them, so long as we have some set of abstract rights/agreements on how we should treat each other: I have no desire to be hurt by them or their notions.  For all the well-put arguments on this usenet, it never does any good.

It's not fully up to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different manufacturer's synonyms):  ------ In practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view of the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my views on things like availability and backward compatibility):  74 The original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively  obsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball  functions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.  74H Modification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher  power consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.  74L Modification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.  Very obsolete; use CMOS.  74S Later modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in  power consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.  74LS Combination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower  power consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of  devices.  74F Fast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high  speed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.  74AS Failed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things  that are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.  74ALS Possible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly  new, availability and prices possibly a problem.  74C Fairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with  4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer  CMOS 74 families.  4000 (Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS  family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low  power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.  Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,  but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).  There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The  clear choice when speed is not important.  74HC A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power  consumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for  general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.  CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of  supply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power  consumption at faster speeds.  74HCT 74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read  the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility  in CMOS involves some compromises.  10K (Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources  claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for  serious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow  the rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,  can be expensive.  100K (For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and  inconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.  As for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and 74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices you can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just have to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible with the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using. 10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.  Me?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are interesting but I haven't used either significantly yet.\",\"A friend of mine is seeing an acupuncturist and wants to know if there is any danger of getting AIDS from the needles.

I think on balance, intervention would create more victims, including American ones.  Since the first responsibility of the US government is to protect Americans, I think they serve that role best by staying away from Bosnia and other regional conflicts.   Of course not.  The Jews were not trying to carve a territory out of Germany either, and except for small-scale resistance and a few larger uprisings, did not have an army or a government.   I see the pattern of atrocities as a fairly often practiced tactic of a colonizing power - driving away and/or eliminating the population of an area they want to control.  The US tried basically that in Vietnam, the Iraqis in Kuwait, the Israelis in Palestine, South Africa, etc, etc, etc.  It sucks, it's ugly, and it's saddening.  But it is not genocide.  It is not my impression that the Serbs want to eliminate every Muslim in Yugoslavia.  I still say the Bosnians are getting their asses kicked; they should surrender and evacuate the areas they can't hold.   I am a staunch Republican, BTW.

By trying to inject the notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without adding any insight whatever.  The same parallel question could be \\\"Is a polydactyl person a human being?\\\"  You still have not answered what you mean by human being.  Please do so.   You won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies. If you want a definition of human being that does not depend on the vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule, provide it for me.   More irrelevancies.  As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does not follow your version of human being.  And as he pointed out, brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights of the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant difference.  What I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the thread you started?  You got answers to your questions when you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some ridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected, changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion of substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance, why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss silly accussations, e.g. \\\"It really doesn't matter to you...\\\" If it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek some substance?  You're not going to convince a logical person of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic and show some meaning to your words.   As others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on which has the better chance at survival.  Again, your analogy fails.  Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here. A woman's womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would not be granted a born human being.  Was that due to its inconvenience?   Is it?  Please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling.   You simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is not accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on for size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments. But the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The systems are dependent on each other for life.  I'm still struggling to see anything analagous here and failing to do so.   Your argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total failure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in reality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible, that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said, you give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe in now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where they cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said, there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim that is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a claim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to its claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?   You haven't answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.   Again you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and it is not as slow as you seem to think.   Yes, and I'd hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn's children that he was murdered by a religious, \\\"pro-life\\\" fanatic.  Please do try to stay relevant.   Clever comeback.  I congratulate you on the readiness of your wit.  What happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake? Why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  What is different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at stake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction are irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction anyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have borne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at parties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.\",\" A freeze dried Tootsie Roll (tm).

I seem to remember a thread with a point similar to this passing through several months ago.  Did anybody keep that list?  Thanks! \",\" A number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner in which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens, and tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For citizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves on a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places, is for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place in banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc... Quite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card for such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or requirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public. Furthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against the bearer in any manner by having access to this information.  The only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field might be taken into account is during interaction with the police, based upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are clearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field is being used to discriminate against them officially.    I take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries do know that they have nothing to fear from \\\"Israeli expansionism\\\". Militarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of land under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a sustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing the Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the Awali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal strip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire. Public opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada via territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from battle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it.  With regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree with the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux of the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating a starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal and a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders, the negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state smaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller borders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be settled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic and sensible.   Your statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a \\\"center for policy research\\\".  Whether or not all of Vanunu's revelations were true has no bearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing \\\"state secrets\\\" after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that said secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished. As to which were and which weren't, I am under no moral obligation to disclose that - quite the reverse in fact. He was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue with a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the concept of \\\"Secrets of state\\\", something which every democratic govt has.   I noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist more than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted, which you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such reports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill, as tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not made public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know about it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be made public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours. This would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an announcement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.   Well, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Such questions are often termed \\\"tabloid journalism\\\" and are not disturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity. Such questions were often used during the McCarthy era as a basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.  To use your own example, these questions might have been lifted from the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking for small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray as a larger and dirtier picture.  My answers were not any more \\\"hysterical\\\" than the questions themselves.  The problem is not that the q's were provocative, it was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  You fall into the same category of those who seek \\\"yes\\\" \\\"no\\\" answers when the real answer is \\\"of sorts\\\".

When a friend of mine went shopping for a small sedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so the salespeople wouldn't give her the \\\"bimbo\\\" treatment. Her first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan Sentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what \\\"we\\\" wanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid kept playing the \\\"let me run this price by the sales manager\\\".  After playing the \\\"good salesman, bad salesman\\\" game, we finally told him that if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps we should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick in the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's \\\"Don't Get Taken Every Time\\\" for a list.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of \\\"you'll have to work with us on this price\\\", also known as \\\"each time you come up a thousand dollars we'll come down ten\\\", the salesmanager gave a signal to his two sales cronies, stood up, and said \\\"well, we can't come down any more so I guess we can't help you\\\" and they trouped out of the room, leaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm. I'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and I mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the door.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on the desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman, and began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few sentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line (!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call another dealership from \\\"his\\\" phone!  I said that since he'd announced that our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our voices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone, anyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom. Sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he begins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore, we're going next door to the Nissan dealership.

In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated predicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This  completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2  could do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.  I've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that I've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and b) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits. That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't  have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get   (RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.  The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is significant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the fit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to  the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark, Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to  add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.  It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the low HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it could just be Ozzie.  The results:                             RBI-HR          Years        Actual   Predicted Carter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6 Clark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6 Matt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8 Smith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6  I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.

The husband is usually physically  stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.   He must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an  example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.  This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what  is God's will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals  His will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some  degree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding  of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the  husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.   One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband  and to the husband through the wife. \",\"I have a pair of car speakers for sale.

VESA-compliant applications should have no trouble setting these modes. (But I'm forwarding your posting to our Software group, just in case.  Can't be too careful.)  Not that I doubt that YOUR applications are failing to run; lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact SVGA they're looking at, and don't use VESA calls (VESA is still pretty new). Every new chip set confuses them.   I think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8, and maybe more (and it's a function of the RAMDAC speed, not the Power 9000). We need to fix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  If you're really interested, though, take a look at the text file P9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in the P9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy, you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right combinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy of the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT file, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choices should show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers. You can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of the driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.  Microsoft uses this gimmick, too.)   The SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT, who to my knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the Hercules Graphite/IIT AGX014 card look really good.  So I'd take the numbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thing with WINTACH, trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the 8514, as if anyone cared.)  It's safer (though not safe) to use benchmarks from \\\"unbiased\\\" sources, such as testing labs, columnists, etc.    I think you'll a large discrepancy between the results of SPEEDY and the results of anything else in the universe on these things.   Font caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization -- Windows has hooks for it built right into the GDI.  What's kind of silly is IIT's use of a hardwired \\\"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then sat on a tack\\\" string in their driver.  Not only is it useless in real applications, it lacks the programming elegance of the \\\"Bart Simpson optimization,\\\" in which you save the bitmap of the most-recently drawn string in off-screen memory, and just do a screen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a second time in a row.  (We call it the \\\"Bart Simpson optimization\\\" because Bart's the only person we can see benefiting from it: he could right \\\"I will not cheat on benchmarks\\\" a hundred times and be done in half the time it would take to actually form each character.)

They probably can't tell Clippered voice from Clippered triple-DESed voice until they get their copy of your key.  Any criminal who's going to use encryption will do it under cover of Clipper.  The only way to avoid this will be to try to prohibit strong encryption.  I probably shouldn't say this, but they could try to detect the use of an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statistical properties of the plaintext.  An old-fashioned wiretap could then detect the use of pre-encryption, which would drastically increase the measured entropy of the input.  A countermeasure to this would be to use steganographic techniques which put out voice.

Client Software: SunOs 4.1.1, X11R5 Server Hardware: Sun IPC Server Software: SunOs 4.1.1, Open Windows 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37)  A Motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the OpenWindows 3.0 server (xnews). The pulldown is displayed but then no button actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> will unstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown is grabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the display continue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. If I log in from another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets back to normal. The same application when run against other X servers (including MIT X11R5 Xsun, DecWindows, Tektronix X terminal) has no problems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a work-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users.  I have tried the following things:      1. Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch        (100444-37).      2. Using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm.      3. Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110).        This had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of        menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method), and        screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. It did seem to help, but I        was still able to get the application to hang.  Repeat By:  This is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times.

[Apologies if I'm answering something already answered in the FAQ. Our news feed has been losing a lot of articles lately - so I haven't seen the FAQ lately to check.]   Two ways:    1) When you start the xterm, you can use command line options:          -n ICON_NAME           To set the icon label          -T WINDOW_TITLE        To set the window title          -title WINDOW_TITLE    Equivalent to -T WINDOW_TITLE   2) You can use escape sequences to change things on the fly:      The basic escape sequence is:  ESC ] <P> ; <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> BEL      where ESC and BEL are the ASCII ESCAPE and BELL characters,     <P> is an ASCII decimal digit -- '2', '1', or '0', depending     on whether you are trying to set the window or icon title,     or both, and <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> is your desired label string.      Hence, this command will set the window & icon title:          echo \\\"\\\\033]0;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\\\\007\\\\c\\\"       To set just the icon title:          echo \\\"\\\\033]1;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\\\\007\\\\c\\\"       To set just the window title:          echo \\\"\\\\033]2;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\\\\007\\\\c\\\"       Of course, you may have to fiddle with exact syntax,     depending on how the echo command works on your system     and what shell you are using (I've shown System-V semantics     under Bourne or Korn shells).      [Hint for Sun OS users:  use /usr/5bin/echo instead of     /bin/echo or Csh's built-in echo.  Otherwise you'll have     to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string     instead of using convenient octal sequences.]      If you want your titlebar updated continously, say to show     your current directory, hostname, or somesuch, then you'll     have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out     the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands.

They're very recent, I downloaded them from the  Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there,  email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.   I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think  the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).  I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version,  improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88)  although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on  Cirrus's part but I don't think so.

Now that the fan has Mike Lupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the  big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance He did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he  had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.     Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent: Morning show:   In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi,  and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti had a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries to copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of sports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he interjects humor and politics into his show. 10 AM to 12 Noon:   I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get better interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story.   I would consider this even because they are two different styles of host.  12 Noon to 2 PM:   At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to  Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability to transcend the \\\"homer\\\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan base.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia  spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan. Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0 score without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys') I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight and I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on  either station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and you can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.  2PM to 4PM:   This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and  Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided in my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining, but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10 to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do get great guests and that is the basis for their show, so it is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the appearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which are often hilarious.    4 PM to 7 PM:   MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like Mike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.   I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he was at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly homer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there is a game on that night, but you will see later for the  reason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.  7 PM to Midnight:   S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes Eli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my nerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go nuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show) On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets Jets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on the west coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course I think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but WIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season. (If this is the sports station, why did they lose the IGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.)) During the summer, it is all talk on WIP.   Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with the exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and 12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.

I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction, just for the sake of changing the API, are valuable.    Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system the memory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are less important.     We will probably buy another C++ class library (something like Tools.h++ or Booch components from Rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff  (allocators etc...).  So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have.  The two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc, they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media.  I was wondering if anyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially ZApp and Zinc).  A couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are:  ZApp ----   Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and     also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes.   Has new fancy 3D-style controls available, and support for custom controls.   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Redirectable graphics display/output architecture (useful for printing)   Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize.   Seems to be the newcomer, this could be an advantage in designing a better system.   Zinc ----   Has a platform independent resource strategy.  (Not too important for me right now)   Comes with a interface builder tool   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Seems to have been around longer (more mature), but grew up out of a DOS version.     Had a better demo :-)  Both have source code availability options Both are lacking OLE support Neither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff   Any thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated,  Thanks,   Brett Harper \",\"   My poor old physics intuition will be very surprised if these tiny  masses, sitting very close to Jupiter, play any role whatsoever in the  problem.

Jeff. \",\"Reply-To: pwhite@empros.com     Here in America people tend to think of choosing a church much like they think of choosing a car or a country club. What I mean is that our  culture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather than considering things with others in mind and not making prayer  an initial and primary part of the decision process. People tend to treat church as they would a club and when something is less than to their liking, off they go to another one.  I think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different  perspective on the \\\"church choosing process\\\". It seems to me from 1Cor 12 that God doesn't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all but that he places us in the body as he wants us. So, I think a better question is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out where God is trying to place me.  If a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church they go to is a logical first choice. You have been born into the family of God. People should hop around from church to church as often as they hop from natural family to family.  If you met the Lord on your own (so to speak) there may not be an  easily identifiable church to try for starters. Here you are more like an orphan. Prayerfully go and \\\"leave yourself on a few doorsteps\\\" and see if anyplace feels like home.   I wouldn't expect that God want to place you in a church where you have difficulty fitting in with the people, but on the other hand there are no perfect churches. If you have an attitude of looking for problems you will both find them and make them. On the other hand if you have an attitude of love and committment, you will spread that wherever you go.   In general, I think that God will try to place you in a church that talks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and is expanding on that base.\",\"   | You certainly do not see OTC preparations advertised as such.  | The only such ridiculous concoctions are nostrums for premenstrual  | syndrome, ostensibly to treat headache and \\\"bloating\\\" simultaneously.  | They're worthless.    | That's not the idea, and no, they don't work.

Just  curious...      --\",\" I just put replaced the motherboard in a system and had similar questions. My 2 cents worth:  The speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker.  A speaker being a coil, it's bidirectional and makes no difference which way you attach.  Turbo switch.   There are three wires to control how you want turbo to become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I think the middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in, and which two wires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriate two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard.  LED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending which way the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard, if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the board, the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboard is like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn't light, power off, reverse the connectors and try again.   It should work.  If it does, then attach the turbo switch to the board.  Hope this helps.\",\" Maybe it milks the dogcow? 9-)    Lots of drivers are available off ftp.cica.indiana.edu in pub/pc/win3/ drivers/video.

Do you degrade them to a sex object in your head?  Are you the master of that kind of thinking?  Do you insult people unknowingly, then regret it later.  Yet do it again the next time opportunity presents itself?  Are you truly the master of yourself?  I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times. That I sometimes say things I do want to say, and then repeat my mistake unwantingly.  I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect of my being.  There are times I know I shouldn't say something, but then say it anyway.  There are times I simply forget a lesson. I, in fact, am not my own master.  I need help.  Jesus promised me this help.  And I took him up on his offer.  I have willfully let Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than I myself do.  And why not?  Does not the creator know his creation better than the creation?  Does Toyota know what's better for the Corolla than the Corolla?   Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you.

That is what my God says.  And that was the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  It's wishful thinking.    Is this the religion of Kendigianism?  Most people are not Christian.

On the <-> contrary, to anyone who understands the game, they have strengthened it. < <No, I originally argued that the Second Amendment was \\\"a little bit <and an anachronism.\\\"  These prohibiting laws are examples why the are <an anachronism.  After all, laws in made by representatives of the  <people.  These representatives of the people have already decided <that the Second Amendment does not apply or is too broad in some <cases.  Since these representatives feel an unconditional  <interpretation is not wanted, then it is probable that they majority <of the people feel the same way.  If this is so, it is an example <of the people using their power of government.  If this is not <how the people feel, the people should stand up and state their wishes.  Wrong.  Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the people almost nonstop on this issue, Constitutional limitations are there to prevent a 'tyrrany of the majority'.  For example, a majority could vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc. and it would fly using the logic above.  When government feels the Constitution is not right for the times, there is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THis is deliberately difficult, and cumbersome, to prevent abuse of those who decide to ignore the people, or impose unjust policies of a majority on a minority.   A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting the hangee.  What the government is doing are VIOLATIONS, end-runs around the limitations on the government, probably because they know that the people would be very hard to convince that a good intention is behind tampering with the Bill of Rights.  Government propeganda on guns has been very strong and persistant, but not THAT strong.  And it just shows how gullible the people have become to \\\"I am from the government and am here to help you sort of line\\\".  We have been lied to, fed half truths, rigged stats, while the government knows their control laws have no effect on crime.  They want a government monopoly on force, pure and simple.  Do you REALLY want the government to be able to override Constitutional limitations by a simple vote of a bunch of elitists (congresscritters)?  I sure don't.  The Founding Fathers sure as hell didn't, either.  <> Mox nix, Mr. Rutledge.  YOU are the only one here claiming that the <-> RKBA is dependent on the existence of a top-flight, well-regulated <-> militia.  Why this is a false assumption has already been posted a  <-> number of times.   < <No, I simple stated that the people have a right to \\\"join a well <organized militia.\\\"  And I have also stated that a militia that <meets once or twice a year is clearly \\\"well organized.\\\"  And this <state of readiness that I have claimed the people have a \\\"right\\\" <to, is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated <by Hamilton.   You better read the Senate Subcommitte on the Constitution regarding the Second Amendment, and a linguist's analisys of the Second itself. IN the meanwhile, show us some stuff to back up your assertions. And yes, I have the above mentioned documents (and more) online. \",\": I believe that Rusty Staub was also a jewish ball-player : Also, Mordaci Brown back in the early 20th century.

Daniel Patrick Staub is a Catholic school kid from Nawlins, Mordecai Brown a farm kid (probably Protestant) from somewhere in the Midwest. He lost those fingers in a farm machinery accident.  Jim Palmer isn't Jewish himself, but Mr. Jockey Shorts's adoptive  parents are.  Also, I'm not absolutely certain that Carew actually converted.  His wife and children certainly are Jewish.  --\",\" [...]     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  [...]  My Problem: I wasn't aware of the fact that I would need an *SCSI*-CD-ROM for Windows NT when ordering the Beta-SDK-Package.

CIA World Map II ---------------- [  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.   If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the   Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from   the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with   searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]    Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)   The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries   in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360   array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for   every half degree longitude and latitude.     A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine   pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).   There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and   builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as   polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask   Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.   The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.   (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to   compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.  NCAR data ---------   NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of   terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at   various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.   This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending   on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,   IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive   is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,   email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.  UNC data tapes with voxel data --------------   There are 2 \\\"public domain\\\" tapes with data for the comparison and   testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT   scans).

Background imagery/textures/datafiles =========================================   First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above.  24-bit scanning: ----------------   Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for   speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :   scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll   house supplies.   So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have   scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.  Books with textures: --------------------   Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.   Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also   a wide variety of stock art is available.   Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,   UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.    In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books   for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your   graphics work. Their address is:  Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,  00196 Rome Italy,  Piazzale Flaminio, 19  Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60  Texture Libraries: ------------------ a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit    textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit    TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume    (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.     Contact:    Mannikin Sceptre Graphics    1600 Indiana Ave.    Winter Park, FL 32789    Phone: (407) 384-9484    FAX: (407) 647-7242  b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine    by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point    versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.    Written by Steve Worley.

Introduction to rendering algorithms ========================================  a. Ray-Tracing: ---------------    I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read   some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would   suggest:    An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press      1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4   Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong   using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines   (erich@eye.com)  There's a more concise reference also:    Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: \\\"An Introduction to Ray Tracing\\\", in   \\\"Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD\\\", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,   NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.  It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.  b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) --------------------------  A good reference is:          _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,         McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.  c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ]  ========================================================================  15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================  a. Teapot ? -----------  \\\"Displays on Display\\\" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot.  IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column \\\"Jim Blinn's Corner\\\" describes an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used.  The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution.  b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------  Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):  model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)  406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown.  Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it.  model2: The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data  model3: The triangles' model.  This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.  Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.  model4: The NASA model.  The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:  <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>  From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions  3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,  10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,  17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches.  Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown  model5: The old shuttle model.  The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.  104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters.  We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.  ========================================================================  16. Image annotation software =============================  a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in   rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a   rasterfile.  b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some   image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not   sure exactly what they are.   You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.  c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)   and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats   other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert   things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.   Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu   (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)  d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).   This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.  e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.  f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based   graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and   two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based   toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,   pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed   tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation   instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).   A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for   SPARC systems is also available for ftp.    All software is the property of Columbia University and may not   be redistributed without permission.    ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of   PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging   routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.  g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the    position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen    color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many   of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest   X11 archive.  ========================================================================  17.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,   synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.    WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming   environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their   imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware   developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their   own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers   (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports   Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was   developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working   for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL   or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I   expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general   purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.   SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose   it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I   have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've   used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best   speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a   freebie if you want it\\\"    \\\"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,   Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its   programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It   handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing   the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even   Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH   Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use   (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical   image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,   cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image   processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve   fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \\\"  [ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and  for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

It is designed to address the reusability    of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an    encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap    manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted   to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only    color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets    developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget    set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers    using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other    Motif widgets.    FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)    simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these   simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these   data graphically.    FVS accepts three-dimensional multi-block data recorded in NCSA HDF format.   iti.gov.sg [192.122.132.130] : /pub/svlib (Scientific Visualization)       /pu/fvs; These directories contain demo binaries for Sun4/SGI    Cost : US$200 for academic and US$300 for non-academic institutions.

In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies. A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a package called \\\"GVLware\\\".  GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available via ftp.  The most interesting program is probably Bob, an interactive volume renderer for the SGI.  Raz streams raster images from disk to an SGI screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.  Icol is a color map editor that works with Bob and Raz.  Source and pre-built binaries for IRIX 4.0.5 are included.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) ===================================================  GRASS -----   (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army   Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and   remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a   Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,   although it is reported to have significant image processing   capabilities.    Feature Descriptions    I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the   internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass   Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using   scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very   user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\\\" A first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in   Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the   GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric   rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective   interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus   and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68    Host Configuration Requirements    If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC   under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster   environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it   easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented   in raster (grid-cell) form.    Availability    CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).    Mail regarding this site should be addressed to   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.    This location will be the new \\\"canonical\\\" source for GRASS software, as   well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.   This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and   \\\"tar\\\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John   Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,   John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review   it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently   maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be   directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu    Support    Listserv mailing lists:    grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level   questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send   subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level   questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation   of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to   grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of   the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in   Champaign, IL).

Microstation Imager -------------------   Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS   software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager   sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a   heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.    Feature Description    Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.   Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).   RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.   Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering   and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,   generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.    The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle   VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available   for GIS applications.   Host Configuration Requirements    It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software   would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.  PCI ---   A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes   an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different \\\"industry standard\\\"   formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I   forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix   workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly   other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.    The \\\"PCI software\\\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of   utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \\\"PCI   database\\\" disk file.  The \\\"Tape I/O\\\" package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape   formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \\\"PCI database\\\" file;   this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can   display data from the PCI database to one or another of several   PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type   dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and   Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.   \\\"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\\\"), and   God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't   use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your   particular application/interest calls for.    Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \\\"parameters,\\\" read from   a common \\\"parameter file\\\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \\\"default   directory.\\\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a   scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also   invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI   data structures (database file, parameter file).    The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but   requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the   level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the   Macintosh calls \\\"raw\\\") data from tape, in a number of different   \\\"interleave\\\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphic-arts industry's \\\"CT2T\\\" format, would probably (I haven't tried)   handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT   YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start   over.  It's worth noting that the PCI \\\"database\\\" file is designed to   contain not only \\\"raster\\\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of   other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,   longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this   can go into the PCI \\\"database\\\").    I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX   systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific   third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to   mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a PCI \\\"database\\\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \\\"overkill\\\"   in your case; it seems designed for the very \\\"high end\\\"   applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's   probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which   does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe   the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these   areas.  SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) --------------------------------   Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed   for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels   across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since   been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging   Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.    Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and   IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).   Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.    The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may   require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame   buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X   for display.  MAP II ------   Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.  CLRview -------   CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit   the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.    This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the   visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports   the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,   TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.    CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129)    in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.

By such a back- door (in the encryption algorithm perhaps) it would be possible (for   the manufacturer) to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in  one session. This would not, btw, enable anybody else to retrieve the  keys in the same way because they'll never get a bunch of 300 (N,U)  pairs with identical S1 and S2. (Note that these have to be constant  for the whole batch by the very nature of the procedure, i.e., they  have to be typed in manually by the `random number supplying agents'!)

Seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that scouting is still worth fighting for.

CPUs Comparison List As a general rule of thumb Motorola chips are faster than Intel chips at the  same frequency {030/25 ~= 386/33; 040/25 ~= 486dx/50}, but Intel has chips at  higher frequencies than Motorola, so this evens out.  The Macintosh Bible 4th  ed. supports the comparisons between Intel and Motorola chips for the 68020  and above.  <=80186    ~ 68000 {16-bit vs 16/24/32-bit chip [data path/address  lines/data & address registers].  The 4MB limit on the 68000 Macs brings it  down to the 80186 and lower chips, otherwise it would compare to the 80286.}  286        ~ 68020 {hardware segmenting vs. 68020's 32-bit ALU and these chips  come have no usable built-in MMU unlike their successors [80386, 68030].

The use of the hardware segmenting and their 16-bit nature put the 286 between  the 60000 and 68030 in features and the LC's 16-bit data path strenghthens the  286 ~ 68020 comparison.}  386       ~ 68030 {Two 32-bit chips with MMUs, and protected memory.

All present Macs support the use of  32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw  allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y- bit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y  independently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63  dpi [12\\\" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including  autosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz  vertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser  Aug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and  IIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit  color (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).   To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display  capability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit  color.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX  will change this. In addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one  monitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same  thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree  of overlap of the pictures. VRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of   built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit  color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display.  Sound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became   standard with the SE/30.  IBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system  interacts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing  BIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation of clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program  interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer  Jawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a  standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is  actually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like  Mac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes,  especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present  things are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver  and monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS,  and monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with  an IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2  486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0  and still have ALL the colors one started out with}. Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster  processors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD  ROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).   MDA: Monocrome Display Adapter  original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text. CGA: Color Graphics Array  320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes. EGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array  640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions   could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes. VGA:  Video Graphics Array*  320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are   the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a   18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock  (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals  from EGA/CGA etc.  MCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array*  subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA   and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).    Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models. SVGA:  Super VGA*  This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch   all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer   using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating  as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a   standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things  are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution  of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since   1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600,   some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually   at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital   Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example],   some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting   factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were:   8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a   64K \\\"window\\\", etc. Other non-SVGA standards:  8514/a:  IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions   like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations   from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do   not have interlacing.  TMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some  do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD. XGA:  eXtended Graphics Array  newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones   are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at   1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes. XGA-2  Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in  Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area  fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co-  exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be   far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth   isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other   companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh   rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual   discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2. *some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.  Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.    Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the   end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software  drivers.  \\\"Fast SCSI-1\\\" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode  {see SCSI-2 for details}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast  SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in    hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are  4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and  15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can  use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such  is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called \\\"fast SCSI-1\\\".   16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics  but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a  different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which  makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}. Mac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though   Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager  needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI  interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast   asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2  controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1))   though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port   interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus   Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some  Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard   and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager. IBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with   systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.  Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers  out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications  which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.  Mac Memory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin   8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs  could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity   feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx   used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new   72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.  The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every  memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will  not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.  Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs   had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris   650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that   allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same   size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting   in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109). Printers, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard. Monitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs.  PDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE,   Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.    Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650:   4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with  the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in   IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows   through put down. NuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,  and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:  40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and   Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a   Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet   to DMA. NuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:  ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7\\\" instead of the   old 12\\\". QuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's   VLBus - \\\"Architecture is identical to that of VLBus\\\" (Byte 10/92:128).  Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development. CPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,    Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at   the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to   dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each   NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with   8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.  IBM Memory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac- like SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.  HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:  MFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited  only used with smaller [\\u00b2 60mb] hard drives. IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.  currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive.  ESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface  ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in  many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of  hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1.   BUS interfaces {New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working  with old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).} ISA  8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a  16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105).  1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,  hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards  aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.}  while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's  showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit  (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.   MCA {Micro Channel}  IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; \\\"allows use of more than one CPU in a computer\\\"   (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components   involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA   and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido). EISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}  32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to   self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable   interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use. VESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS}  Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit}  250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus   mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for   video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of  their patents (Mel Martinez). QuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture  (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines  (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development. PCI  Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace   ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development.  OSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.] and multiple application use.} Mac 512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows  Apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw,  menu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require  clone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires  access to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM  chips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support  interface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS  has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and  therefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control  over hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with  some of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a  totally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon  Wtte). 6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy,   cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.    Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program   interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of   AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a   24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as   real RAM is below 8MB. 6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers. 6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X. 7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard   to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present   non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on  system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking   within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing   can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be   accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X},   Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable   IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType   support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present   machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is   both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit   mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last   'free' OS. 7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than   7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode   on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension.   Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades  {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.  [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system   fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any   RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all   fonts from the system file.] A/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and   a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS   is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac   ROMs.  Price: $709. Note: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats  including the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and  DCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd'  and AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most  still play.  IBM  Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for  programmers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.   Since hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition,  what little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}   This results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or  EPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to  better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which  is harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it  reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware  support is needed. Side note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing  all feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing  its Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 (\\\"Undocumented Windows\\\") and  \\\"There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to  abort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present\\\" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92  #201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC  judicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no  action.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of  choosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has  turned down Microsoft's copyright of \\\"Windows\\\" which would allow it to charge  a fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93). MicroSoft OSes DOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier   with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program   must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS   Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit   Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in  DOS 4.0. DOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk   defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for   networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99}   (Byte April 1993:44-46). DOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93). Window 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to   deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to  run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the  equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface].  This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac  programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and  still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed  is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman).  Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS  counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108). Window 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base   requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx.   Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92). Windows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).    Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1   with built-in peer to peer networking support. Windows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the   swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in   the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the   reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM   but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92).  This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric   multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in  networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even  though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor  is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993  (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993  (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495  (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93). Other OSes PC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS   6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93). DR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression}   and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later   version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple   file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92). OS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM,  60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded,   multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file   to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}.   IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this   (InfoWorld Oct 26/92). AIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS. NeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.  Beta out, final   version to be out by May 25, 1993. Solaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric   multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with   tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and   communication package.  Client: $795,  50 users server: $1,995, 1000s users  server: $5,995.  Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195. Mac 7.1 [working name: Star Trek]:  Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel   Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM   (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run   on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps   will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to   Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow   progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in   late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.}  PowerPC Rumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92;  MacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA  video (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week  3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps. Apple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and  to have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to  sale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser  9/92:146)} (MacWeek 3/22/93). PowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on  PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain  (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard  drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993.  Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993. Pink [Taligent OS]: Expecting delivery in 1994 (Wall Street Journal 1/12/92)   and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and   PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93). Windows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details. Solaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the  Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state   that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for details NeXTStep: possible port see IBM OS section for details.  OS Number Crunching (Mel Park) Mac  Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard  Apple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an  FPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or  taking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are  handled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal  representation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment  of 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and  the FPU programmed directly.  IBM  Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when  emulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever  compiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers  exceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS  prompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this  better.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS,  Windows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.  Networking [Includes printing] WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially  if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer. Mac Hardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.   LocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for  each machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to  include very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in  Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at  about $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and  transceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet. The Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet  interface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a  network option since 1989. Software: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can  use variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS  as well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open,  Banyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing  machines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows  typical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version  will have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993  (MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC  Pathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software  built-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra.  Printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in  the chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the  chooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers. Printing bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.  {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}  IBM   Hardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing. Software: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk  protocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}. Each of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible  with the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to  that product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more  forgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest,  {~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and  offers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more  complex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac  finder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;   InfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93) Printing {Very OS dependent} DOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port,   and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written   software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly   implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one   software program to the next. Windows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing \\\"jobs\\\"   in the print queue, but it always lists printers as \\\"active\\\"... even if they   are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers   on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine   which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like   and intelligent about this. OS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS. Printing bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do  not have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and  not that of the OS involved.  Price issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features  than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars  by both worlds. The IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware  standarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to  handle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac  hardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,   built-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and  NuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent  equipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs  which cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.  Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993. All Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.  Except where  noted, monitor is extra and a built-in monitor interface is provided {no card  needed except for 24-bit color display}. IBM planned a $1,200 386SLC/25MHz model with a 60MB hard drive and color VGA  monitor {~VRAM} (MacWeek 8/17/92) {sounds like a Color Classic without SCSI-1,  sound support, built-in network support, FPU socket, built-in expansion to  16-bit color, etc}. Color Classic:  $1,389 - 030/16MHz with 16-bit data bus {~386sx/20MHz  equivalent}, 4/80, FPU socket, and built-in monitor. LCIII: $1,499 - 030/25MHz {~386dx/33MHz equivalent}, and 4/160. Centris 610: $2,899 - 68LC040/20MHz {Depending on the program ~486sx/40 or  ~'486dx2sx'/20[40]MHz equivalent}, 8/230, built-in ethernet, 300i CD-ROM, a  PDS/NuBus 90 slot and VRAM for 16-bit color. Centris 650: 040/25MHz {Depending on the program ~486dx/50 MHz or 486dx2/50  MHz equivalent} with a PDS and 3 NuBus 90 slots. $3,189 {ethernet, 8/80};  $3,559 {ethernet, 8/230}; $3,999 {ethernet, 8/230, CD-ROM, VRAM for 16-bit  color}  Bibliography notes 'Vaporware' is available in the digest/vapor directory by FTP on sumex- aim.stanford.edu [36.44.0.6] and was by Murphy Sewall {last issue: April 93.} 'Info-IBMPC Digest' back issues are available from wsmr-simtel20.army.mil in  directory PD2:<ARCHIVES.IBMPC> 'Dictionary of Computer Terms 3rd ed.'

Most X servers use a version of  malloc(3)  which will not return   memory to the OS (ie. the X server might  free(3)  a Pixmap, but the heap does   not shrink).    Well, part of the routines I mentioned do a dirty little trick to get around   that problem. First, I create the shared memory segment, attach the client,   attach the X server, and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man   pages on removing of shared memory segments, you will see that the segment   only dies after all attachments are gone.   Now, if the client dies, that's one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you)   and since the X server notices the client has dies, frees up it's resources,   including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment. No more   shared memory segment.   Terrible, but it works.      Regards,\",\"I am looking for some bar code fonts especially code 3 of 9.

Our constitution was built by men who had to risk their lives to ensure freedom in our country. They designed the system to make it difficult for tyranny to arise. For instance, one of the reasons the fourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for the government to try to make smuggling a crime. Think I jest? John Hancock made all his money smuggling rum, which is, after all, a drug.  Think about it. The government has everyones keys in escrow, and the FBI gets their pet \\\"wiretap without leaving the office\\\" scheme. There is a coup, which happens every day all around the world. Within hours, everyone in the country who might oppose the tyrants is being monitored more closely than ever before possible.  Without the tools being in place, a tyranny cannot stand. With tools like this in place, a tyrannical dictatorship could actually be successfully imposed.  Why give the government tools with which to enslave you? Maybe you can trust Bill Clinton, but are you willing to tell me that you can trust EVERY government that will ever arise in the U.S. hereafter? I am not willing to make that leap of faith.   I'm a political dissident. As such, I am acutely aware of what happens to political dissidents in most of the world. In most of the world, I could be killed for my beliefs. Call Amnesty International some time to find out what happens to dissidents in most of the world.  All that seperates the U.S. from most of those places is a thin piece of parchment in the National Archives thats being constantly more and more eroded by such farces as the war on drugs. Coups have happened in countries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years. Governments throughout history have fallen. No government has lasted for more than a few hundred years. Often, they are replaced by dictatorships. Do you really believe so intensely that it could never ever ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and the lives of your children and other loved ones on it?  If we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced, we make it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen, because if it happened with the tools already in place it could actually stick.   Naive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where hundreds that have gone before have failed. Thriving democracies led by men far more skillfull than Bill Clinton have fallen to dictatorship. Rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilled men before they became a tyranny.  I, for one, am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here. Only hubris would allow us to believe we are immune to what has happened elsewhere.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\" Sometimes I have a problem with doctor's prescribing medicine like this.  I of course don't know the exact situation, and anti-depressants may work, but it isn't helping the ringing at all, is it?    Mine started about three years back.  Turns out I have tinnitus bilateral (translation: ringing in both ears, basically ;).  If this is what it is, she'll probably get used to it.  It would keep me up and drive me nuts too, but nowadays, I have to plug both my ears with my fingers to check to see if they are ringing.  Usually they are, but you get so used to it, it just gets tuned out.  Yes, this is what I've read about it... not just from my own personal experience.    Millions have it, according to my physician.  You just learn to cope with it (like I mentioned earlier) by ignoring it.  It eventually becomes unconscious.  The doc also said it could be caused by diet (ie: too much caffeine) and stress, but I haven't changed my lifestyle much, and it just comes and goes (it is always there somewhat, but now I rarely notice it when it really \\\"kicks in\\\").  Also, it doesn't necessarily mean there is any hearing loss, either caused by it or causing it.  I had an ENT (ear/nose/throat) exam, and passed.  In fact, my hearing is quite good considering I don't take as good of care of my hearing as I should.  Her reaction is normal.  If it is tinnitus, chances are good she'll begin to not even notice it.    This info is taken mostly from a few \\\"experts\\\", my own experience, and some readings (sorry, it was a few years back and don't have any specifics handy).\",\"xIn article <1qgi8eINNhs5@skeena.ucs.ubc.ca> yiklam@unixg.ubc.ca (Yik Chong Lam) x>Hello, x> x>       Does anyone know how to take out the bolt under the engine x>compartment?

It's use as prayer language seems especially troubling to me.  I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doing the talking.  And when you pray, you pray to God.  And the Spirit is God.  So, the Spirit is talking to Himself.  Which is why I only go by the Pentecost use where it's an actual language.  Moreover, the phrase \\\"though I speak with the tongues of men and angels\\\" used by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would then assume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, it is no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.  Hmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see how God PUNISHED by giving us different language.  Can we assume then that if angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME one amongst other angels?  After all, THEY were not punished in any manner.  So why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE ANOTHER?  It's disturbing to think that some people find ways to  justify jabbering.  But I'll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned.  Trouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts at verification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that the witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outright fabrication was involved.

You refer to # differing interpretations of \\\"create,\\\" and say that many Christians may # not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith # on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is # truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.  It may be \\\"irrelevant\\\" to you and *your* personal beliefs (or should I say \\\"bias\\\"?), but it is relevant to me and many others.  You're right, \\\"the bottom line IS truth,\\\" independant from you or anyone else.  Since you proclaim \\\"truths\\\" as a self-proclaimed appointee, may I ask you by what authority you do this?  Because \\\"it says so in the Bible?\\\"  --Does the Bible \\\"say so,\\\" or is it YOU, or someone else, who interprets whether a scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or \\\"disapproval\\\"?  Excuse moi, but your line of \\\"truths\\\" haven't moved me one bit to persuade me that my beliefs are erroneous.  Of all the \\\"preachers\\\" of \\\"truth\\\" on this net, you have struck me as a self-righteous member of the wrecking crew, with no positive message to me or other latter-day saints whatsoever. BTW, this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus to the pharisees: \\\"ye hypocrite(s) . . . ye preach about me with your lips, but your hearts are far removed from me...\\\"  # Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created # and eternally existent are equivalent, you say \\\"granted the Mormon # belief...\\\" You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to # have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address # and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the # conclusion that you grant.  Sophistry.  Look who's talking: \\\"jumping to conclusions?\\\"  You wouldn't do that yourself, right?  All YOU address is your own convictions, regardless whether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points of view, because you reject such interpretations without any consideration whatsoever.  # # The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus # is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS # belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same.  A beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of lds doctrine.  The former KGB would have loved to employ you. Jesus and lucifer are not \\\"the same,\\\" silly, and you know it.  (...)  # The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is # nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible # says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:  Correction: it may contradict would YOU think the Bible says.  The Bible indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they \\\"belong to\\\" or follow God in His footsteps.  Satan and his followers have rebelled against God, and are not \\\"children (=followers/redeemed) of God,\\\" but it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to separate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of salvation.  # #        The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the #        kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked \\\"one\\\"; #        (Matthew 13:38)  kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus (and have shown \\\"works of repentance, etc.), and the children of the wicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb.  The issue of satan's spirit-offspring (and those who followed him) has not been addressed in this and other verses you copied from your Bible.

In this single posting of yours, I've seen more \\\"constructs of imagination\\\" than in all of the pro-lds mails combined I have read so far in this news group.  First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us about \\\"the only true God,\\\" whom you interpret according to your own likes and dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about Him myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other faiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different way or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission and progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited every continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.  #  This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but #  rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read #  something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches.  Sigh.  \\\"What the Bible teaches\\\"?  Or: \\\"what the bible teaches according to Robert Weiss and co.?\\\"  I respect the former, I reject the latter without the remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by the way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you being a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a Christian (following my own image of Him in my heart).  (...)  #  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of #  Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't #  think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the #  issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this #  subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may #  certainly be.  The issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis- represent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of \\\"official doctrine\\\" is obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial (e.g. \\\"The Seven Deadly Heresies\\\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best, or erroneous at worst (\\\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation\\\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations (his book \\\"Mormon Doctrine\\\" is oftentimes referred to as \\\"McConkie's Bible\\\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books! (The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen.

The first and easiest to fix is interference from something around the monitor, such as another monitor or other electrical device.  Try moving the system to another location to fix that problem.  Second, because of the scan rate of the monitor, it tends to synchronize with room lights and can cause the interference you are seeing.  Try turning off all lights in the room(s) around the system and see if that helps.  If not, try moving the system somewhere else.

Good luck -\",\"Frank, I tried to mail this but it bounced.  It is fast moving out of t.a scope, but I didn't know if t.a was the only group of the three that you subscribed to. Apologies to regular t.a folks.    You must be using 'values' to mean something different from the way I see it used normally.  And you are certainly using 'Science' like that if you equate it to \\\"the real world\\\".  Science is the recognition of patterns in our perceptions of the Universe and the making of qualitative and quantitative predictions concerning those perceptions.  It has nothing to do with values as far as I can see. Values are ... well they are what I value. They are what I would have rather than not have - what I would experience rather than not, and so on.  Objective values are a set of values which the proposer believes are applicable to everyone.   I don't agree. Science is useful insofar as it the predictions mentioned above are accurate.  That is insofar as what I think *will be* the effect on my perceptions of a time lapse (with or without my input to the Universe) versus what my perceptions actually turn out to be.

Odishe Liyetze on the Turkish front, he wrote,  \\\"On the nights 11-12 March, 1918 alone Armenian butchers   bayoneted and axed to death 3000 Muslims in areas surrounding  Erzincan. These barbars threw their victims into pits, most  likely dug according to their sinister plans to extinguish   Muslims, in groups of 80. My adjutant counted and unearthed  200 such pits. This is an act against our world of civilization.\\\"  On March 12, 1918 Lieut-colonel Griyaznof wrote (from an official Russian account of the Turkish genocide),  \\\"Roads leading to villages were littered with bayoneted torsos,  dismembered joints and carved out organs of Muslim peasants...  alas! mainly of women and children.\\\"  Source: Doc.

(Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander         of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War,         Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov)  \\\"The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the  liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the  allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of  the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian  was permitted to approach the city and its environs.   While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained  in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the  area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to   attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the  plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder  of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by  the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers  who had remained in the rear during the war.   One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of  soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of  seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,  and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud  and dirt...   It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and  traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds  and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night  patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The   Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear  also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the  trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for  fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder  and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.   Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir  Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander  in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.  The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals  that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its  highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half  of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.   ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,  Odishelidge. They were as follows:   The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the  act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...  More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been  killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless   Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the  murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood   near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:  'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten  more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when  the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.   The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently  fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.  Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw  towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew  to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and  destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.   During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages  that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the   Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers  were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time  when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill  the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries  of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the   Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would  have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from  acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with  hatred and loathing.   Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that  he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The  Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the  stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since  the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed  in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen  of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping  him with the iron heel of his boot.   Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape  from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off  by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered  children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village  of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:   There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.  Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and  spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about  25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140   centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,  children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of  rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.   A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators  for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov  to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be   proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's  disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,  instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely  reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told  the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more  licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent  and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity  and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,  the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and  claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.   An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command  narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:   The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut  out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.  The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men   of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they  took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people  among this group were able to save their lives as the result of  my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were   released when they learnt that I understood what was going on.   Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the  Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered  on the streets.   On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent  Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were  threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for  murdering an innocent Turk.    When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would   be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare  you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the   Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard  that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within  the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same   day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to  him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible  act. However no result was achieved.   In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a  natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived  the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the   Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had  been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular.   The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed  one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached  three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details  of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers  were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even  withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred  people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading  Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.  However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with  the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower  classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders  of the leading Armenian figures and commanders.    I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals  were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who  opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that  it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.  Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian  cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have  supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred  to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by  the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.  You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a  conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear  of the Turkish soldiers.\\\"   Serdar Argic\",\" |Hi, everybody:  |    I guess my subject has said it all.

The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger    icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the    debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed    to do).

Yet it was still home to thousands of people who, in happier  times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off  the map.  .......  As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of  Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt  that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been  the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke  apart.  .......  I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and  people were predicting their fate with grim resignation. Zumrut Ezoya,  a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the  town, called her community \\\"sitting ducks, ready to get shot\\\". She and  her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 26.  .......  \\\"The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages, one by one, and  the government does nothing.\\\" Balakisi Sakikov, 55, a father of five,  said. \\\"Next they will drive us out or kill us all,\\\" said Dilbar, his  wife.

There was a road, and the first units of the column ran across then  all hell broke loose.

Survivors say that Armenian  forces then began a pitiless slaughter, firing at anything moved in  the gullies.

CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH  ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO  INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...  As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw  the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as  they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to  journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts  of the hills.  The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING  of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians  last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death  or missing...   Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter  as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there  was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer  ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We  swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon  under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.  We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round  again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a  valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung  round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired  repeated blasts.  Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting  had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in  fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter.  I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window,  its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on  \\\"our side\\\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a  search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.  Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two  M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed  flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second  crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains  and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters  were there to give covering fire if necessary.  The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet  armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani  official told us that there were now five former Soviet military  helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \\\"They have  signed contracts to fly for us,\\\" he said. The helicopter we engaged  in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian  pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.  We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an  heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer  white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four  corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an  Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies  on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back  towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before  the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.  Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the  civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were  covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor  mortis. They had been shot.  What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave,  and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY  DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

From LA Times, Friday, April 9, 1993.  P. A1.    EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE    By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer    SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the  Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a  nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than  950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as  12,000 people.    Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco  authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how  operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and  infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,  right-wing and what they called \\\"pinko\\\" organizations.    Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known  organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting  anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking  any laws.    Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to  gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los  Angeles and San Francisco.    Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political  spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan  Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish  Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of  directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San  Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.    People who were subjects of the spy operation included former  Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.  LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who  is based in South Africa.    Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was  confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement  agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and  organizations was sold separately to the South African government.    In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from  police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony  counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West  Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify  the search warrant.    The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than  25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.  Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in  San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation  Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax  attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not  be reached for comment, his office said.    Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a  panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial  recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a  former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.    The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied  repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.  League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an  employee and have said they simply traded information with police  departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.    But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches,  San Francisco police alleged that \\\"ADL employees were apparently less  than truthful\\\" in providing information during an earlier search  conducted without a warrant.    David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said  the organization has not violated the law.  \\\"There is nothing  nefarious about how we operate or what we have done,\\\" he said.  \\\"Our  record speaks for itself.\\\"    The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret  fund used to pay for \\\"fact-finding operations.\\\"  Lehrer, according to  the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.  Patterson.    An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to  a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending  them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.    Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for  nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with  San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many  sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as  \\\"Skins\\\" and \\\"Pinkos,\\\" but that did not necessarily mean that they were  under surveillance.    \\\"I might never see or call up on 99% of them again,\\\" Bullock said.  \\\"And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a  threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under,  say, 'Pinko.'\\\"    In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police  Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he  was questioned by the FBI in the case.    A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records  and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,  vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license  photographs.    Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and  Bullock also provided information to the South African government,  receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.    The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the  South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss  nature of the spy operation.    The file notes that Kraft's articles \\\"appear frequently in The Times  and are well researched and written,\\\" but little else about the file  is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another  Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong  Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal  information.    Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how  Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from  skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash  of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his  own paid informants under code names such as \\\"Scott\\\" and \\\"Scumbag.\\\"    He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,  exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,  including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.    It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying  on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African  government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an  agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the  probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The  Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather  information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,  Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and  investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league  offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of  San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax  Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to  cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los  Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that  some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may  have come from Los Angeles police officers.        From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.    ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION    By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.    SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a  civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities  who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential  police information on citizens and groups.    But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation  League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many  felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax  violations and conspiracy.    Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful  about its spying operations, which collected information on more than  12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political  spectrum.    Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show  that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept  files on political figures.    Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down  its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when  deciding what charges to file.    In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.  Foxman described the ADL as \\\"a Jewish defense agency which has fought  to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80  years.\\\"    Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on  extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing  information to police, journalists, academics, government officials  and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain  information illegally, he said.    \\\"Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and  physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or  identity of any source of information,\\\" Foxman said.    The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its  longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than \\\"a private  individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'\\\"    Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements  showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through  Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.    \\\"Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be  distanced from ADL,\\\" Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.  Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.    Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate  with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn  over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's  offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.    A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,  produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial  transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it  will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.    \\\"The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,\\\"  the district attorney said.\",\"  Unfortunately, Hep B infection can eventuate in chronic hepatitis and subsequent cirrhosis.  Although not many patients with Hep B go on to chronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is something to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) much more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which also leads to cirrhosis.    Of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function.  Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas, among many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic circulation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis.  These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in men, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplant.  Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in your friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully he or she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to you, and offer you support.\",\"    I think the legal term would be \\\"negligent homicide\\\"      Well, it's nice to see someone with a brain, a general lack of paranoia, and a willingness to put his thoughts in public.

This is an improved version anyway so no loss the first time.  HL}  The standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents  is probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, \\\"Hermeneutrik und  Kritik,\\\" _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of _Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Noerdlingen: Beck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The  Prophetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 (SLC:  Deseret Book, 1989). (If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibley describes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little knowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subject and the reader.)  Nibley's extract from Blass's work is in the form of \\\"rules for forgers.\\\"  It makes interesting reading.  I confess that I have not read Blass's work, only Nibley's extract thereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required and as far as I know there is no English translation available.  However, I believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that  any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one  would expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not  be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to  determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and  culture or is a later forgery.  Actually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:  1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For example the Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientific means to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found with them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual physical objects.  2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the copy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find a document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something from centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several generations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still  be tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannot expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so we must confine our testing to the text itself.  It is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if the document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date the document and identify its culture of origin.  For example I've heard of a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king in what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn up scholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the holograph).  They could check the language, content and writing style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a Palestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results were positive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually wrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but (barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for  comparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way to determine who the actual author was.  As I say, I'm no expert on Blas's work.  I do remember some of the tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.   Specifically we might ask:  1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradict itself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to  maintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The  longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency. For this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.  2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time? Again a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the writing is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be able to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuous things which someone from that culture would get right without even thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous  and trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.  3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speech etc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that  seem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book?   If so do they fit in with the culture?  Of course there are complications if the document has been translated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language when he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the culture claimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems and reduce certainty to be sure but don't necessarily prove forgery.  These tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work  with) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the  historian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to  ask are, \\\"Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we  know about the culture of claimed origin?\\\"  If there are things  which don't fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due to our lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really  significant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture.\",\"If gamma ray bursters are extragalactic, would absorption from the galaxy be expected?

First and foremost, I want to mention some common sense.  If it's a choice between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is only one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first.  Second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent.  Third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social beasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are two types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which dominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible. But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh rapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!  Now, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a game, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one; when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of interception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to react to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of.  With a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures may be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important -- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the road, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up newspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The larger the dog, the greater your anger.  Dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he are not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.  Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped punishment.\",\"I've used on-chip capacitors to reduce ground-bounce noise on a small systolic array chip that had 50pF loads on the clock lines. (Design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the MOSIS scalable design rules.) Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors:  1) They don't help much with simultaneous output switching--there is  still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the  load capacitor (on both the signal line and the ground  return), so you still get ground and power line bounce.   2) They do help a lot with on-chip loads, as I had with the high load  on the clock lines.   3) The transients you are trying to suppress are really high  frequency, so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff  capacitors, since the RC time constant is too large.  What I did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich,  but put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent  diff-metal1 contacts.  I forget exactly how wide the poly  lines were.  If I were doing this design again, I'd probably  omit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,  using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high  resistance it can be ignored at these speeds).  4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with  slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for  output signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.  I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for  a MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as I  needed.

A columnist for the St.  Paul \\\"Pioneer Press\\\" wrote an article giving the \\\"inside scoop\\\" on the  issue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible  candiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic  Center (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty  confident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will  ultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other  two sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the  inter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name)  believes that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also,  because of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed  until (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.   However, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed,  because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for  conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to  this mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future  viability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even  further.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of  knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging  Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met,  which may happen.  Regarding possible candidates, the three teams are  Hartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \\\" Ice Demons?\\\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't  been announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the  Target Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in  as many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see  Hartford and Tampa show up there either. So, Minnesota may end up  getting another team, but it may take a few years.

Of course, in your termonology, God could not \\\"cease to exist.\\\"  However, that is not what death ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see that it signifies \\\"separation.\\\"  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is the reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one member of the Godhead was separated from the other two.    I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived.  She was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my \\\"girlfriend\\\" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were separated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided that she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was death.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not because He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go there.      When I rebelled against my earthly father, he spanked me.  I found no wisdom in that until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued on my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and unloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us do as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh.

It is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually suffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we do.  He \\\"grew in knowledge.\\\"  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose to be taught.  It is my understanding that He was \\\"led of the Spirit\\\" to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and Jesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him, the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise.  That is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was living sequential history as you or I.    Maybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not.   I was once a member of that club.  THe \\\"free thinker\\\" is a glorious ideal.  By contrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right.  But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his \\\"rational doubt\\\" when in fact he was led to it by his \\\"faith\\\".  He must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a \\\"free thinker\\\" to criticize the Christian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize him as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.  Pascal pointed out that \\\"sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.  Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.\\\"  The fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms, hence the term \\\"a\\\"-theist.  Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In my campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember.  However, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word, every point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.  That is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out \\\"Look, your fly is undone!\\\"  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity.  The answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on presuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral.  In other words, another myth.    Presuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence.   Of course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first \\\"Highlander\\\" movie.  But again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of God.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His prophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you are to reject God's annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct understanding of Himself.\",\"Visual Numerics Inc. (formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in the process of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0  and C Exponent Graphics 2.0.  (Both X Exponent Graphics and C Exponent Graphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through  June 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with  ansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge  tape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products.   X Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts:   1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types    available through a large collection of X resources. 2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers. 3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization. 4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback. 5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget     library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar     to X programmers. 6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge's UIM/X product.    This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical    layout of an application.   C Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts:   1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library    is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C    standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C. 2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse     interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control    with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization. 3. Large collection of high-level application functions for \\\"two-call\\\"    graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available    with minimal programming effort. 4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling    the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot    the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can     control the event loop.

Some people may also reason that by reading the bible and being a Xtian you are permanently damaging your brain.

Because:  I am a living, thinking person able to make choices for myself. I do not \\\"need\\\" you to show me what you think is the way; I have observed too many errors in your thinking already to trust you to make up the rules for me.  Because: I set the standard for my *own* morality, and I permit you to do  the same for yourself.  I also do not try to force you to accept my rules.  Because: Simply because you don't like what other people are doing doesn't give you the right to stop it, Hudson.  We are all aware that you would like for  everyone to be like you.  However, it is obnoxious, arrogant thinking like  yours, the \\\"I-know-I'm-morally-right-so-I-can-force-it-on-you\\\" bullshit  that has brought us religious wars, pogroms against Jews, gay-bashing, and other atrocities by other people who, like you, \\\"knew\\\" they were morally right.

It is not a moral standard that I am presenting you with, Hudson.  It is a key to getting along in life with other people.  It is also a point of respect:  I trust other people to be intelligent enough to make their own choices, and I expect the same to be returned.  You, on the other hand, do not trust them, and want to make the choice for them--whether they like it or not.  It is also a way to avoid an inconsistency:  if you believe that you have  the right to set moral standards for others and interfere in their lives,  then you must, by logic, admit that other people have the same right of  interference in your life.   (Yes, I know; you will say that your religion is correct and tells you that only agents acting in behalf of your religion have the right of interference.

The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example, was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign. His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie year.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound.  Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had good numbers immediately.  I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it didn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.

This is not hell, this is permanent death. It is indeed what atheists (generally) expect and it is neither fair nor unfair, it just is. You might as well argue about whether being made mostly of carbon and water is \\\"fair\\\".  However, the atheists who claim that Hell is unfair are talking about the fire and brimstone place of endless suffering, which necessarily includes eternal existance (life, I dunno, but some sort of continuation); not at all the same thing.  Granted, you clearly feel that hell=death, but this is not a univeral sentiment as near as I can tell.  If *your* idea of God \\\"condemns\\\" heathens to ordinary death, I have no problem with that.

I remember seeing an old Nova or The Nature of Things where this idea was touched upon (it might have been some other TV show).  If nothing else, I know such liquids ARE possible because...  They showed a large glass full of this liquid, and put a white mouse (rat?) in it.  Since the liquid was not dense, the mouse would float, so it was held down by tongs clutching its tail.  The thing struggled quite a bit, but it was certainly held down long enough so that it was breathing the liquid.  It never did slow down in its frantic attempts to swim to the top.  Now, this may not have been the most humane of demonstrations, but it certainly shows breathable liquids can be made.\",\"    Well, yes, the exhaust is where the majority of the noise comes out, but the basics (tone, firing cadence, etc.) are determined by the engine configuration. In the case of the Viper, yes, we are discussing a HUGE multicylinder 90-deg. engine, which will sound somewhat like a truck.  And my understanding, btw, is that that V-10 engine was designed originally with the intention of being ad- aptible for either the trucks or the Viper.  And from what I've heard (no first hand knowledge :-( ) it's doing a pretty good job at both.

If playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then it is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times in 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is, some things will be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season.  But that is only for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with injuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really rather be playing golf, don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say this for sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I don't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically human attitudes.    With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing  money by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff \\\"take\\\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely to consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are going to come back with \\\"winning spirit\\\" and all of that crap but these players are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the  game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make a decent living.   Of course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is  being paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.  The second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions of the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top  after the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and \\\"hot\\\".  The  emphasis on the playoffs, with their \\\"sudden death\\\" appeal has been promoted by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh loses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the league over the year.  They proved it.  cordially, as always,  rm \",\"  I recall reading in the recently revised edition of the \\\"Yeast Connection\\\" that there is indeed work by researchers to do this.

I beg to differ.  It will probably make a big difference at some point.   Thankfully, it is true that the majority go through life without having to use a firearm.  Howver, there are situations where firearms are the most effective means of self protection.  What other means do you propose as equally effective?    New to this country? New to political theory? Alas, I was speaking of principle.  Without principle, all attempts at republican forms of gov't are futile.  There are times when public and political opinion are contrary to principle, which is why we have a Constitution which enumerates gov't powers and presumes certain rights.  A major reason for this was to prevent a tyranny of the majority.   This is exactly why law should be based on reasoned thought, not immediate perception.  Of course, it doesn't always work that way. Fortunately, while there are no guarantees, logic sometimes does prevail.  And, if not, there are still means for correction.   As far as \\\"enough active voters\\\" are concerned, that is still an open question until the vote is made.   You portray a possible scenario for the future.  But, how will you silence RKBA supporters right now?  As long as public debate is allowed, such debate will continue. If we allow public debate to be restricted or denied, then we will get a gov't we deserve.\",\"  [stuff deleted]  Actually, it does make a reasonable amount of sense. Fixed disk sectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is quite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the controller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 wasn't cached, the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance, and it's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more loss of CPU cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence.  The floppy, on the other hand, is not buffered, so that using the CPU for floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr, by the way) really does stink.\",\"     In case you haven't noticed, Clintonites are pushing a universal health     care ACCESS program.  \\\"Access\\\" here means that folks who do not give      a damn about immunizing their children will have health care services     delivered to their doorsteps.   --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Disclaimer: Opinions expressed are mine, not my employer's.\",\":    Does Dorothy Denning read this group?

This was two weeks to the DAY from when I called the order in.      Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the  peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway  documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals. The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office) was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and  has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a  lot to do with it.      It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications.  I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then \\\"maps\\\" the other machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can \\\"cd\\\" to these drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine. It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the  peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive.     My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430 credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!    So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it was me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-)        John  \",\"Grf. Dropped my Shoei RF-200 off the seat of my bike while trying to rock  it onto it's centerstand, chipped the heck out of the paint on it...

Then, while it was drying, I realized that I was out of smokes and that my  cage is not currently running... So I \\\"had to\\\" take my bike down to the  store. Not wanting to mess up my paint job, I said \\\"Well, heck. I can just  use my old helmet\\\".... this is your standard el cheapie openface...

The xpert mailing list is the general, public mailing list on X maintained by the X Consortium. The mailings are gatewayed, so xpert is almost  identical to the comp.windows.x Usenet newsgroup.    *** If you get comp.windows.x, you don't need to  ***  *** be added to the xpert mailing list.   ***   Otherwise, you can join the list to receive X information  electronically. It is best to find a local distribution; perhaps someone within your company is already receiving the mailing. As a last resort, send mail to  xpert-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with a valid return electronic address.    The xannounce mailing list carries major X announcements, such as new releases (including public patches from MIT), public reviews, adoption of  standards by the MIT X Consortium, and conference announcements.  It does NOT  carry advertisements, source code, patches, or questions.  If you already  receive the Usenet news group comp.windows.x.announce or the xpert mailing  list, you don't need to be added to the xannounce mailing list.  Otherwise, to  subscribe, send a request to xannounce-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu. Note: Only  redistribution addresses will be accepted for this list -- i.e. no personal  addresses. If you wish to receive xannounce yourself, please contact your mail  administrator to set up a local redistribution list and to put you on it.    comp.windows.x.apps is not gatewayed to a mailing list.   In addition, the X Consortium sponsors these public lists:   bug-clx         CLX bug reports and discussions   x-ada           X and ada   x11-3d          people interested in X and 3d graphics   ximage          people interested in image processing and X   xvideo          discussion of video extensions for X  To subscribe to one of these lists, assuming no-one in your  organization already receives it, send mail to <list>-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with the Subject line including the name of the LIST in caps and the request \\\"addition request\\\".

GXUGiV is the German X User's Group in Vorbereitung (\\\"in preparation\\\") being formed for X programmers and users; it is associated with the EXUG. All interested should contact Olaf Heimburger (+49 30 7 79 54 64; and at mcvax!unido!tub!olaf).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   6)  What related FAQs are available?   Liam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posts a FAQ on Open Look to  comp.windows.open-look.    Jan Newmarch (jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) posts a FAQ on Motif to  comp.windows.x.motif.  Peter Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) posts a FAQ for comp.windows.x.intrinsics; it is on export in contrib/FAQ-Xt.  Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca) posts to comp.windows.x a FAQ on  maximizing the performance of X.  Steve Kotsopoulos (steve@ecf.toronto.edu) posts to comp.windows.x a FAQ about using X on Intel-based Unix systems.  The FAQ in alt.binaries.pictures contains information on viewing images with X and on massaging image formats.

There exists a PEX/PHiGS FAQ.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   7)  How do I ask a net-question so as to maximize helpful responses?   When asking for help on the net or X mailing lists, be sure to include  all information about your setup and what you are doing.  The more specific you are, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without all the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are able to respond at all.   Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it  from. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system, give details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S  version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to  mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.   Then tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what you expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the  exact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote  doesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary  (just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available?   The trade magazines (Unix World, Unix Review, Computer Language, etc.) are publishing more articles on X.  Two X-specific publications include:   - O'Reilly and Associates publishes \\\"The X Resource: A Practical  Journal of the X Window System\\\" (103 Morris St. #A, Sebastapol, CA 95472).   Editorial information: Adrian Nye, adrian@ora.com.   - The X Journal is started bi-monthly publication September 1991 on a  variety of X topics. Subscription information: The X Journal, Subscriber  Services, Dept XXX, P.O. Box 3000, Denville, NJ 07834, USA. Editorial  information: editors%topgun@uunet.uu.net.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   9)  What are these common abbreviations/acronyms?   Xt: The X Toolkit Intrinsics is a library layered on Xlib which  provides the functionality from which the widget sets are built. An \\\"Xt-based\\\"  program is an application which uses one of those widget sets and which uses  Intrinsics mechanisms to manipulate the widgets.  Xmu: The Xmu library is a collection of Miscellaneous Utility functions useful in building various applications and widgets.  Xaw: The Athena Widget Set is the MIT-implemented sample widget set distributed with X11 source.  Xm: The OSF/Motif widget set from the Open Software Foundation; binary kits are available from many hardware vendors.  Xhp (Xw): The Hewlett-Packard Widget Set was originally based on R2++,  but several sets of patches exist which bring it up to R3, as it is distributed on the X11R4 tapes. Supplemental patches are available to use it with R4/R5.  CLX: The Common Lisp X Interface is a Common Lisp equivalent to Xlib.  XDMCP: The X Display Manager Protocol provides a uniform mechanism for  a display such as an X terminal to request login service from a remote host.  XLFD: The X Logical Font Description Conventions describes a standard logical font description and conventions to be used by clients so that they can query and access those resources.  RTFM: Common expert-speak meaning \\\"please locate and consult the  relevant documentation -- Read the Forgotten Manual\\\".  UTSL: A common expression meaning \\\"take advantage of the fact that you  aren't limited by a binary license -- Use The Source, Luke\\\".  API: Application-Programmer Interface. The function calls, etc., in a programming library.  BDF: Bitmap Distribution Format; a human-readable format for uncompiled X fonts.  GUI: graphical user interface.  UIL: the User Interface Language, part of OSF/Motif which lets  programmers specify a widget hierarchy in a simple \\\"outline\\\" form  WCL: the Widget Creation Language, a package which extends the  understanding of the Xt resource format such that a widget hierarchy and  actions on the widgets can be specified through the resources file  GIL: the file format put out by Sun's OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0  UIMS: User Interface Management System  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  10)  What is the ICCCM? (How do I write X-friendly applications?)   The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the  official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It  describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with  other clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need  to read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the  selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window  manager.  Get it either:  - as part of the R4 distribution from MIT  - in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys \\\"X Window System\\\" book  - as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, \\\"X Protocol Reference Manual.\\\" A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.  The version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to  the efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the  presentation.  [from David Rosenthal, 10/90]   - the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's \\\"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5\\\". The complete document is on the R5 tapes.   Alternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in \\\"RTFM\\\" and is the most-important of the least-read X documents.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?   The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of  cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software  interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.  MIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and  administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the  Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership,  Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).  Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail,  with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape, interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.   Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with  others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification is produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium as a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public  review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.  Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or  Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.  Write to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer  Science, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.  [For complete information see the XCONSORTIUM man page from the X11R4 distribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?   OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK was developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was developed by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF  members.    OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide;  there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications. Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the  one from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce  programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's  (formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a \\\"virtual toolkit\\\" which provides objects in the style of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.   OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising  their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.  [Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?   Open Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system  that combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface  specification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including the SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and a number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).  [thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?   DECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI  toolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a  session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar,  dxpsview, etc.).  (At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.) [8/90]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  15)  What is PEX?   PEX is the \\\"PHiGS Extension to X\\\".  PHiGS stands for \\\"Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics  System\\\" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation  and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in  hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension  allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized  hardware for 3D graphics.  Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely  redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample implementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release. Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for  their workstations and X terminals.  [last modified 10/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  16)  What is \\\"low-bandwidth X\\\" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?  There are several options for using X over serial lines:  SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP packets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years, and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations. Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really  ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per  packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully  so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links).   CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the  40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do  anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help, but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed  data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).  PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than SLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial  line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for  running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable.  XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition  to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes  redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and  using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a  pseudo-X server or \\\"proxy\\\" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There  are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:    (1) You don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't   otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly   connected), and    (2) It reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that  have to cross the serial interface, and    (3) In addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering   packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for   blocks to compress.  LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a standard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using  NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information  (e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps,  etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a  Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample  implementation available in R6.  Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/ in the following files:         XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote         XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX  [information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]   There is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk at the 7th MIT X Technical Conference.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?   The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the X window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is no single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways  for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout, decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order (generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):   wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3  uwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed,  although it is very outdated.

It needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your  window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X  session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your  window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in the background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:   exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action. Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window,  whether or not you kill or restart your window manager.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?   Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature -- which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the geometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something  close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are  looking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces.  Look for the application \\\"xplaces\\\" on an archive-server near you. There are  several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage. [10/90]  Some new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the  saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running applications and the resource database.  [Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?   DEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this,  add to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:  sm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?   You can turn auto-repeat on or off by using \\\"xset r on|off\\\". The X protocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is a capability not supported by all systems.  Some servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over  server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the  server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server  from MIT with the options \\\"-ar1 350 -ar2 30\\\" to reduce the sensitivity of the  keyboard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?   There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful  for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and  does not do \\\"macro expansion.\\\"  Some (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors,  accept a translation resource such as:  xterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\\\   <Key>F1: string(\\\"setenv DISPLAY unix:0\\\") which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control characters in the string, use \\\\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include.  Window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor has a special \\\"remapper\\\" client been made available.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  David B.

I think Orthodox practice varies from place to place, from parish to parish and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In some parishes here in South Africa the only ones who receive communion are infants (i.e. children under  7). In our parish it is expected that one will have been to Vespers and confessional prayers the evening before, and that one will have been fasting.

SCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit},  and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit SCSI can be wide or fast, it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the Quardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}.

The PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2  controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device {As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs IDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the \\\"20% faster then IDE\\\" came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with SCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 controller chip. SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips {becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit mode {the fast version, SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips {or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH worlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware (port, electronic controller, etc) is VERY expensive.

The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world, has been cut off from the world for weeks.

THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                 Dorothy Denning                             Revised, April 21, 1993   INTRODUCTION  On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key.   CHIP CONTENTS  The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the \\\"MYK-78.\\\"  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about $30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the technology is shrunk to .8 micron.   ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.  Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,   which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed.  The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the session key:     D[E[M; K]; K] = M .   CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW  All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at Mykotronx.  At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random 80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.    To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a 64-bit block R1:          R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .  Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:            R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]          R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .  R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies.  As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit key parts.    The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind.   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2, and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies.   The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or both may be independent from the government.   LAW ENFORCEMENT USE  When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder.   CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION  A successor to the Clipper Chip, called \\\"Capstone\\\" by the government and \\\"MYK-80\\\" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast exponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for testing on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for delivery in June or July. \",\"I have the following for sale:  TI 855 Printer in excellect working condition  $100 + postage  Game = The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes    Original box and contents used 1 time and   unregistered  $30 + postage  If iterested EMAIL me at:  EMAIL = caldwell@epcot.spdc.ti.com\",\" The willingness of the majority of the people to give up their freedom in  exchange for a sense of safety is hardly limited to the USA, and is an  endemic problem in any human society of any appreciable size.  The structure  of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but  fighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have  comfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't really have the former,  in the long term, unless you have the latter.  One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird  cross between a libertarian and an \\\"establishment tool\\\" is that I end up  taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when  the government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my  lifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.    As a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government  to be \\\"fair\\\".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed,  whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the  government would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem.   What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal,  so much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong)  sense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth  it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its  citizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the  major architects of the American system of government, figured that in a  couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it  would be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.  I  agree, and while I don't go around trying to spark one, I'll certainly  participate if it happens when I'm around.  There is a reason I am such a  strong supporter of individual rights while being so cynical about politics.   I've already written off politics.  And yes, this may get me in trouble some day.  If so, so be it.  I drive  faster than 55 MPH, too. \",\"About two months ago I purchased the Adaptec ASW-410 driver for use with a CD-ROM drive.  At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I had with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with CD-ROM drives.  Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a major way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver (I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something).  I wasn't too fussed about this until I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I now find that the audio-mode will not work.  I assume it is not being handled correctly by the ASW-410 driver.  So, should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade?  If so does anyone know their FAX number?  Any assistance appreciated.  Regards  BTW: everything else works fine, certainly seems that Sony have caught up with      the rest with the 641.\",\"I recently had to move and forgot to update my address to the Orthodox mailing list.

Again from my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}: Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some   specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller   specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.    Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the   end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a  SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2  which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it   needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be   very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst   {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and  reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between  SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.  IBM HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: [...] IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.  So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES  the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can. The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}\",\"   I have one and it is my favorite CD-ROM drive so far.

It  is updated each month and only information currently under discussion or  of continuing importance or interest will be listed for more than two  postings.    Boston Bruins   Boston legislators and the developers proposing a new Boston Garden  finally agreed to a deal that puts the 19,000-seat, $160 million project  back on track to be finished in September 1995.   Right wing Daniel Marois will be sidelined indefinitely following  surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back. **   Sent defenseman Glen Murray to Providence of the American Hockey League.   Buffalo Sabres 1-800-333-PUCK (1-800-333-7825)   Acquired left winger Bob Errey from Pittsburgh for defenseman Mike  Ramsey. **   Veteran Buffalo Sabres broadcaster Ted Darling will be inducted into the  club's Hall of Fame Sunday, April 11.  Darling, who joined the expansion  Sabres in 1970, was the team's play-by-play announcer on both television  and radio until illness forced him out of the booth during last season. **   Recalled forwards Viktor Gordiouk and Doug MacDonald from Rochester of  American Hockey League.   Calgary Flames   Acquired veteran right wing Greg Paslawski from Philadelphia for future  considerations. **   Recalled center Todd Harkins and left winger Tomas Forslund from Salt  Lake City of International Hockey League.   Chicago Blackhawks         The $175 million, privately financed United Center, scheduled to  open in August 1994, will be home to the NBA's Chicago Bulls and NHL's  Chicago Blackhawks. The stadium is owned by entities controlled by the two  teams. The owners apparently still have not made a decision on whether the  old Chicago Stadium will be razed for parking space once the new facility,  located directly across the street, opens.   Suspended defenseman Craig Muni indefinitely for failing to report  following a trade with Edmonton.   Detroit Red Wings   Acquired defenseman Steve Konroyd from Hartford for a sixth-round draft  pick.   Annnounced the signing of right wing Joe Frederick, their 13th pick in  the 1989 National Hockey League entry draft. **   Two contrite hockey fans have returned the stolen Michigan Sports Hall  of Fame plaque honoring Detroit Red Wing great Gordie Howe. The bronze  plaque was stolen more than four years ago from Cobo Hall in Detroit, site  of the Michigan Hall of Fame.   Edmonton Oilers   Sent forward Esa Tikkanen to the New York Rangers for center Doug  Weight.   Traded defenseman Craig Muni to Chicago for forward Mike Hudson.   NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the Edmonton Oilers' lease with  Northlands Coliseum must be improved if the team is to survive in the  city. Edmonton Northlands is a non-profit agency set up by the city to  administer exhibition facilities including the Coliseum.  Oilers owner  Peter Pocklington calls his lease with Northlands horrendous and has  threatened to move the team if he doesn't get a better deal. He makes no  money from parking, concessions or building advertising. The 17,313-seat  Coliseum also has few of the lucrative private boxes that produce  significant revenues for other owners.   Announced center Kevin Todd will not need surgery but will miss the  remainder of the season with a separated shoulder.   Hartford Whalers   Sent defenseman Steve Konroyd to Detroit for a sixth-round draft pick.

Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of  one goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman.

At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises  will have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total  of 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa  Bay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two  new teams.         Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority  drafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst  records. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The  expansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose,  Tampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.         The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry  Draft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new  teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in  1994.          The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the  1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a  delay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.  -----   - League news:  Disputes:    The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary  arbitration procedures, clearing the way for about 40 hearings.

CHL: Fort Worth Fire, Wichita Thunder, Dallas Freeze, Tulsa Oilers, Memphis  River Kings, Oklahoma City Blazers    Six non-affiliated teams play a 60 game schedule extending from early  November to mid March. Each team is owned by the league, with local  interests controlling day to day operations. Each team has a $100,000  salary cap for 17 total players (16 dress up). Unlike the ECHL, players  are not limited to three years in the league.   A Western Division may be added to the Central Hockey League for the 93- 94 season if the plans of CHL president Ray Miron materialize.  Miron  confirmed that El Paso, Amarillo, Tuscon, and Albuquerque are cities under  consideration for the Western Division, which would play some interlocking  games with the Eastern Division.

Major League Hockey was founded by Roy Boe, former president of  the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League and the New York/New  Jersey Nets of the American and National Basketball associations.         According to Boe, the league will debut with six to eight teams  playing a schedule of approximately 80 games. Franchise applications have  been received from groups in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit,  Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, San Francisco, Saskatoon, Toronto  and Worcester, Mass., Boe said.         Although the league will not raid existing leagues to stock its  rosters, Boe said it will seek the ``world's finest hockey players.''         Boe said league play will have an international flair and  discussed implementing some rules which are reminiscent of those of the  IIHF.         ``We're removing the red line, moving the goal nets forward and  eliminating all tie games,'' said Boe.         The MLH office will operate out of Stamford, Conn.  -----   - British Premier Division:    contacts:   Neil A.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:    Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?  A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in  and around Montreal. Hence they were called \\\"Les Habitants\\\" (natives of  Montreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.    Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?  A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to  signify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer  existed and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.   Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?  A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is  a weekly journal with up-to-date info. Phone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US) Phone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)    Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in  the NHL?  A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1  chances.    Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?  A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when  a goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a  +, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short- handed goals do count for +/-.    Q: What is the five-hole?  A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones:  (1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower  right, and (5) five-hole.    Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?  A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven  series were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a  game, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.   Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?  A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever  to play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for  the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis  Blues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat  Expo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine  shots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately  lost the game, 6-4.   Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?  A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed  the richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be  worth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7  million a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.   Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?  A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National  Basketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey  League, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as  assistant general counsel. He became the league's chief legal officer in  September of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell  University in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.   Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?  A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and  Colonial Hockey Leagues.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------   9. Miscellaneous:    For field hockey discussions, go to the newsgroup rec.sport.hockey.field.  For skating discussions, go to the newsgroup rec.skate.    Some sites get another hockey group, called clari.sports.hockey. c.s.h  consists of the UPI feed for all UPI news articles that are related to  hockey, including game results, summaries, scores, standings, etc.  Much  of the information in the NHL team news section comes from this newsgroup.     The rec.sport.hockey Frequently Asked Questions posting is posted semi- monthly, usually on the 1st and 15th of each month, during the hockey  season.  This file was originally created by Tom Wilson, who posted it  during the 1991-92 season.  It was taken over by Mitch McGowan for the  1992-93 season.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------     Please make corrections via e-mail, indicating \\\"r.s.h FAQ\\\" as the  subject line.

Mitch McGowan <hamlet@u.washington.edu>\",\"  That's why zoologists refer to you as a 'fecal shield'. Colonel Semen  M. Budienny, a subsequent Soviet military fame, said about the  Armenian genocide of 2.5 million defenseless Turkish and Kurdish  women, children and elderly people during his visit to Anatolia  in June 1919 that  \\\"the Armenians had become troublemakers, their Hinchakist  and Dashnakist parties were opportunist, serving as lackeys  of whatever power happened to be ascendent.\\\"  In September 16, 1920, Major General W. Thwaites, Director of Military Intelligence, wrote to Lord Hardinge, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs:  \\\"...it is useless to pretend that the Armenians are satisfactory  allies, or deserving of all the sympathy to which they claim.\\\"[1]  [1] F.O. 331/3411/158288.  In the Special Collection at Stanford Hoover Library, donated by Georgia Cutler, the letter dated Nov. 1, 1943 states that  \\\"Prescot Hall wrote a large volume to prove that Armenians were  not and never could be desirable citizens, that they would   always be unscrupulous merchants.\\\"   Source: Documents: Volume I (1919).         \\\"Document No: 50,\\\" Archive No: 4/3621, Cabin No: 162, Drawer          No: 5, File No: 2905, Section No: 433, Contents No: 6, 6-1, 6-2.

There are many \\\"faces\\\" in landforms on Earth; none is artificial (well, excluding Mount Rushmore and the like...).  There is also a smiley face on Mars, and a Kermit The Frog.  The question of life in a more mundane sense -- bacteria or the like -- is not quite closed, although the odds are against it, and the most that the more orthodox exobiologists are hoping for now is fossils.  There are currently no particular plans to do any further searches for life.   Mars Observer, currently approaching Mars, will probably try to get a better image or two of the \\\"face\\\" at some point.  It's not high priority; nobody takes it very seriously.  The shadowed half of the face does not look very face-like, so all it will take is one shot at a different sun angle to ruin the illusion.\",\"Hi  I am trying to implement a pointer feature in Xlib  I have multiple windows and all can take input and  show output simultaneously on all other displays  I want to implement a pointer feature   I would like to get the pointer to come up on all windows once  I choose pointer in the menu and every one should be able to see it  Can you give me some hints as to how I should proceed    replies will be greatly appreciated\",\" Oh no!

If you and I have been created for God, naturally there will be a vacuum if God is not our all and all. In fact, the first chapter of Collosians brings out this status of Christ, that He should have the preeminence.

Hence big cooling towers.    When the utility gave up on that Cinnci, OH plant (Zimmer?) and announced they were going to convert it to a coal-fired scheme, the turbines were already in place, and they were the low-temp type. So the plan was: Install a SECOND set of high temp turbines, and feed the low-temp ones with the output of the new ones.  Never saw anything more on this.

It's a Motorola part with a 1972 date code and the number    285-4\",\"  But why do you characterize this as a \\\"flight of fancy\\\" or a \\\"fantasy\\\"? While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here, it appears obvious that his speculation (for lack of a better or more neutral word) was at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance of current theory coupled with his observations.  It would appear that something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation into that theory (or to tailor the theory to cover the observation).  This does not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of fancy or a fantasy.   Well, I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word (also, \\\"extra-scientific\\\", etc.).  Nor am I prepared to give a general account of rationality.  In terms of examples, there is some danger of beginning to quibble over what a \\\"surprising\\\" experiment is, what counts as \\\"surprising\\\", etc. The same may be said about \\\"logical grounds\\\".  My point is that quite frequently (perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced to previously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses of some other theory or domain).  I would offer some rather well known examples such as Toricelli's Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his \\\"sea of air\\\" hypothesis.  Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) \\\"surprising\\\"? Well, given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must be counted as so.  Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed) out of \\\"perfectly rational grounds\\\"?  Well, there was a pretty successful and well know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit. The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty at the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it \\\"new\\\"?  Well, one could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new domain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you like.\",\" I wholeheartedly agree.  Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies seize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.  WE have to take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create laws and rules only to better their positions within the government.  WE have allowed them to take too much power from the people of this nation.  That situation has to be changed.  Allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off drug informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact with the Devil himself.  It's a vicious cycle.  The law enforcement agencies are motivated to seize property to fund their own activities.  And having no easy way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more incentive for the agencies to take property.  It's also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that Clinton would have the \\\"plumbers\\\" out in force shortly.  Clinton and his henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control.  Anytime a leader believes in that, the leader will use every means possible to retain that control and take more.  WE have to take OUR government back.  Otherwise we will end up living in the equivalent of a high-tech third world dictatorship.  We have to take responsibility for ourselves, our personal welfare, and our actions.\",\"  I just got through listening to the 10 o'clock news on Channel 4 here in Dallas. They trotted out a list of justifications produced by the ATF after \\\"months of investigation\\\" for their raid.   I couldn't believe the junk on this list! For example, the BDs were accused of stockpiling a bunch of \\\"9mm and .223 ammunition that can be used in M15 and M16 assault rifles\\\". Imagine that--they had ammunition!  They also had aluminum dust! (Yeah, it's a component of thermite, but so far I haven't heard that it's illegal to take a grinder to the aluminum lawn furniture...) The only thing on the list that could conceivably have been illegal was an M-79 grenade launcher. (Anybody know about this?)  Months of investigation! For this 80+ people died! \",\"I'd like to compile X11r5 on a Sony NWS-1750 running NEWS 4.1c.

Remember, I don't even think of Clipper as encryption in any real  sense--if I did, I'd probably be a lot more annoyed about it.   That's not for Clinton (or anyone under him) to say, though.
