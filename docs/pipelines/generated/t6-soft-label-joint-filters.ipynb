That wouldn't even make a good 600 these days. Then again, I paid $2800 for it, so technology isn't the only thing that's changed.

I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive,  and am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on  it.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician  Gold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by  having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is  necessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it,  and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard  drive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad  sectors a week.           Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with  an Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this  message twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program  and did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining  for new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about  sectors for a brief period of time.           I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the  exact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the  same error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went  to the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough  there was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG,  but removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors,  either audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the  cache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.           Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix  them, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are  no errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other  files, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them  for a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to  completely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through  the c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.           Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on  my hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in  about every 100 files are affected.             I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s  system, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about  smartdrv to help me out. \",\"In <lsran6INN14a@exodus.Eng.Sun.COM> emarsh@hernes-sun.Eng.Sun.COM (Eric             Huh?

Does this mean that open carry is allowed?  If so, just how 'open' does it have to be?  Would an in the pants holster be considered concealing?

What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting in your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending  trial for the shooting?

Gary Suter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored by D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also made some bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially impressive.   The games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and never recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches, hits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren Rychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think Vernon can be blamed for any of the goals).

Reproduced under open license granted by Audio Books, Inc.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  This is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington, DC  20006.     Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30, 1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.    It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South Atlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute between Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's far more than that.     The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a giant military operation.  During this month of April 1982, fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South Atlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on all sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the Southern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.     Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of the Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a counterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.     To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of time, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is coming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are overextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannot simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time without drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no matter how risky they may be.     There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no choice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That reason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered losses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by the British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts will the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle losses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice but to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking even heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short, my friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.     The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange, ironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearing countless commentators referring to the British task force as an \\\"armada\\\" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very uneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400 years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force, but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it changed the course of history--and it was none other than the English navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.     The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the reign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England.  They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake and his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada by changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped with new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of reach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered the big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely half the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake's defeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened the door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its expansion into a truly global empire.     Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full circle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the world empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now the cultures of England and of Spain are once again in confrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for invasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four hundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day; today, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.     The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake Passage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of the Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's naval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may well break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal Navy.     My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:  Topic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND Topic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE Topic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.  Topic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and a half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great Britain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the Falklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been countless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it calls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing in the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about them.     The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba is from the United States, and they are not much of a prize.  After 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer than 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the remote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over, and yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are watching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.     The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all about its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's doorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it's got at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight.  Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and submarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and sent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada numbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has already been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.     Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's this fight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the major media is \\\"oil.\\\"  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist under the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands, but that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina this month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island.     South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with no known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South Georgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia Island is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys, glaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable.  On top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or historical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it stands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.     In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by Argentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took over the Island.  For that and other historical reasons, Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina, not Britain.     But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It has always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or Spain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even more unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina's leaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They were well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island could not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island was retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina's military junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia Island at all?     My friends, the answers to all these questions are military, not political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an enormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installation buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island.  The real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret installation, together with two other similar installations which I will describe shortly.     The secret military complexes have been in existence for many years; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear war timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in Washington.  For the past two months I've been reporting the details of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain and verify them.     The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of this year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat that caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.     What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of the Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The mutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the Rockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin are behind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of the \\\"PROJECT Z\\\" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase is to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both Russia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR ONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around the world.     The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are working with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of other countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in Government war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie smoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered remains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the open.  They will confront the world with the only remaining fresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using that military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of the world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off NUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel and Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a race against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.     Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are benefitting from war preparations which were started by the Rockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since the Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United States Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United States Government has been a house divided, torn by internal power struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions.  But before that, the United States had been dominated for decades both economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller Brothers.     In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world domination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half secret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28.  It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret while appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the details, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By deliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United States would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia.  Then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be unleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.     When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the Rockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the late 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that the war being planned would have very different effects on the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern Hemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great Britain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the strategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are relatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern Hemisphere war.     In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas not initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the war clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is very little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from the North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then it works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image of this process takes up the southern half of the planet.  Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone, but very little of the air changes places.     The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming nuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for generations to come; but if the calculations are right, the Southern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war.  This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A quick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller cartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I discussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson Rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during the war.  He accomplished this as so-called \\\"Coordinator of Hemispheric Defense\\\" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  So that takes care of the South American continent and its natural resources.     Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller control was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa, especially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the efforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER No. 36.     Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land masses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and New Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the Rockefellers.     The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military installations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming war.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the surviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern Hemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually recovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire would be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third generation Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to inherit the Earth.     In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after the war, some means would have to be available to project military power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against Rockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the beam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar military domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based in the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the Northern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in existing shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built and they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no small task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built.  The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and naval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear attack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered prematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.     The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection against attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all these plans were still in the early stages of development, the answer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to Sweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden naval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs which come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off with enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.     The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided that a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the Swedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of candidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered coastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong.  Other areas were rejected because they were too close to the equator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too many people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy impossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for the secret naval installations be totally secure politically.     At last the sites for the secret naval installations were selected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was selected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme importance in the coming war.     In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located close together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South Island where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes down virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of the installation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island, which is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island facility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.     The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since World War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even closer to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location is far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep under mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also too deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New Zealand site is well situated to command the entire South Pacific.     In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found.  That site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located perfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The tall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret installation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island.  It is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of New Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the northeast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from the secret new installation which was being built, but Britain took no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down.  Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia Island except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.     Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New Zealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's.  The techniques were adapted from those used previously to build other large underground facilities, such as the NORAD installation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve construction access directly from the sea instead of overland.  In this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in appearance both during and after construction.     The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well camouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When sealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you know exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction projects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying around to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house the secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and debris was disposed of at sea.     Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake disarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed greatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal role in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamara presided over the public paring back of America's visible military power.  This included the closing down and dismantling of entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that shipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends, was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in New Zealand and South Georgia Island!     The secret naval installations have been used as duplication facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and built here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two ships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is an exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing techniques.     The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret installations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of certain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear powered--nuclear \\\"subs\\\"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers; and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin was built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and for the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been financed through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we constantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft whose manufacture was financed the same way!     The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are all duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the secret naval ships possess one key difference.     Last month I revealed that the so-called \\\"Stealth Program\\\" has succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility shield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance by distorting light waves in its vicinity.     A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into crash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of the secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been outfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes because there is more room for the powerful equipment that generates the field.     After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American Bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on earth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world domination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my friends, but three years ago they lost control of the United States Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are in control, and they are bent on war.     These secret naval installations have precipitated what is being called the \\\"Falklands crisis.\\\"  Topic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described \\\"PROJECT Z\\\", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR WAR ONE.     An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in Washington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strike the first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war with Russia.     Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable war bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in stalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United States and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand strategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially their secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and rule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it will be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks themselves, this outcome will constitute victory.     Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two months ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for nuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is fast running out.     The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward war; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in this race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are equally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the Bolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the new anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two mutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in certain ways.     In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a limited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting between Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning point in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality, and is responsible for the so-called \\\"Falkland crisis\\\" now dominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new relationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far short of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be settled between them, but for the time being they have called a truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly enemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.     The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to slow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war.  If they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller cartel in certain political movements which I discussed last summer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war timetable will also give more breathing space for additional anti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.     The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February that military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very quickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.     The exact details of the \\\"PROJECT Z\\\" war plan are not known to either the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines are known to be as I described last month.     It was decided that military action should be devised that would undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the Bolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the Southern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone.  The Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these bases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to attack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.     It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both secret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be attacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the Bolshevik war plan still workable.     Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault on the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was no combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside world.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the very war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.     But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different matter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was also its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected the secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military assault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her long-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.     As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has dominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives were sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government military junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland Islands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to enable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine generals were not told everything about the situation by any means, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to do.     As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were promised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the shooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine hands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military assistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the troubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards, the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.     On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack plan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things, landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia Island.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old buildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they also raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British, always nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as expected.  The British Antarctic survey ship \\\"Endurance\\\" put 22 Marines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down the Argentine flag.     The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine Junta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a boil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that South Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered that way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now came in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from Argentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.     During late March, Argentine military forces started assembling for an assault on the Falklands.  \\\"Nothing new\\\", thought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out threatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed that they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine forces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this time they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine public statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims to the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next day a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia Island.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance initially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point of view; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were overpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13 alleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint Rockefeller-Russian attack plan.     Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine forces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected.  Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the cavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was set up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian members concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening, April 3, the military high command in London finally learned what was really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under attack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling of the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next step was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a weapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it would be a nerve gas.     The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the British government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be described, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the so-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik controlled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, \\\"Me, too\\\" any time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against Russia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective countries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered that their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.     Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval armada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of the day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding around the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling would break through into the roof of the naval base in about three weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South Georgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend themselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships were ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to sail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with tactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance doors would be suicide.     On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was seized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports.  The same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He was forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the Rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack preparations.     That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other secret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina.  The two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on \\\"Red Alert.\\\"  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin base were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at sea undergoing \\\"sea trials\\\", but that still left seven (7) major ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the nuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.     On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister, Costa Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy.  Costa Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from certain officials.  He got them!     For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories about the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while negotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story.  The Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as possible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived in time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The official stories about \\\"slow movement\\\" of the British armada were intended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be, the fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island, then it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the announced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South Georgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.     It was initially expected that advance elements of the British fleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two weeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint Rockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it was completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a shambles of the plan.     Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent left Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was announced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into trouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on South Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In moments the ship was without any command, its communications and radar silenced.  Then a Russian \\\"sub\\\" closed in and quickly finished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is known, there were no survivors.     This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two results, both important:  First, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic by the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a configuration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost valuable time.  Public announcements from London about the progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for arrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching out longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint commando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.  The other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was flashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible action.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting involved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could be in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the seven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in southern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational headquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast of New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to provide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible to communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I explained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the Stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded communication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes headquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South Georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of South America.  The deployment of the available ships of the South Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint Rockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in New Zealand!     The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed by other events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out of port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos Aires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he was there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top Governmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have revealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four days later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded his plane, Haig somberly told reporters, \\\"Time is running out.\\\"  And so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.     The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the hollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military analysts in London had not expected that it could be completed until at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was still out of range.     The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the long hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the effects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed everyone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside sufficiently to badly disable them.     Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging on the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands awaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to the eye due to their protective shields, which also protect against beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the tactics which the Russians employed.     Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships using their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF.  As I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which PRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations of the ships to the attack submarines.  The \\\"subs\\\" were armed with special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to explode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective shield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode.  Within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik Stealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went their Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from around the world.     The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local time.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23.  That evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public with the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was wearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught always to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning from ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian military operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret Bolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out, bottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific fleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won the secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.  Topic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression that war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real war in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That aftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been promised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.     At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing for a public announcement that the United States will side with Britain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat up fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to fight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be explained without a public battle; but by fighting, the Bolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and tragic defeat for the Royal Navy.     Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now concentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On all sides now we are hearing about the so-called \\\"nuclear freeze movement.\\\"  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent months, there have even been referenda popping up on election ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are banding together to warn the public about what would happen if there were a nuclear war.     We are being told that all this is just popping up spontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet now we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you believe that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never, and I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and money--and plenty of it.     What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations machine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefeller cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it does, they will lose everything because they are not in a position to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the Rockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is a war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in its power to prevent a nuclear war.     The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them and Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this does not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the Rockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessity right now for the Rockefellers.     The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with the Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of the deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear war; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of reckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.     The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective with their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is renewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old dream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly provided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar campaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan Administration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people.  The Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on that latent fear as a tool of power.     These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands crisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new super-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the bill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new organization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working name, though this may be changed, is the \\\"World Nonproliferation Council.\\\"  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of nuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be to use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.                         LAST MINUTE SUMMARY     Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO LETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called Falkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret Bolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern Hemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down the nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the results remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal Navy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain's Waterloo at sea may well be at hand.     My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our United States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They differ in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we are ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture tells us, our Lord \\\"...has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, of love, and of a sound mind.\\\"  We must learn to wage peace.  As our Lord declared long ago, \\\"Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.\\\"\",\" Well it still looks like you've got an attitude problem Mr. Muttonhead.  You should take the comments with more sensitivity.  I still despise most people who belittle drinking and driving since my first girlfriend was killed  by such an asshole back in '85.  Learn to take the verbal  abuse.  If you can't take the flames,  and you can't use your brains, stay out of the newsgroup. \",\"   Sure, I can. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Motorcycles, edited by Erwin  Tragatsch, was published by The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited,  Astronaut House, Hounslow Road, Feltham, Middlesex, England.

Perhaps you could  let the net know.  Bob.\",\"I'm looking to buy a 100% working keyboard for a 286 system (preferably  a 101 layout.)

Hence, they did help build the league, although they were not great players themselves.     I agree that a name is a name is a name, and if some people have trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans, then changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like a reasonable idea.  If we can get people in the (arena) door by being uncomplicated, then let's do so.  Once we have them, they will realize what a great game hockey is, and we can then teach them something abotu the history of the game.       No, I would not want to see a Ballard division.  But to say that these owners are assholes, hence all NHL management people are assholes would be fallacious.  Conn Smythe, for example, was a classy individual (from what I have heard).    Also, isn't the point of \\\"professional\\\" hockey to make money for all those involved, which would include the players.  What I think you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as should have been their due, and it is the players that are what make the game great not the people who put them on the ice, so naming division after management people rather than players is adding insult (in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was deserved).   \",\"mjs>No No No No!!

(I admit I've never actually seen this.)  I've experienced this, back when I was young(er) and (more) foolish...  My first bike used to track extremely true.  Going down the highway, I would set the throttle tension screw up enough to hold the gas steady, slide back on the seat and lean against the backrest, riding without any hands.  If I needed to turn, I'd shift my weight into the turn, and lo and behold, the bike would turn, sans touching the bars! Granted, it wouldn't turn very fast, but it proves that you can turn a bike without countersteering, at least not in terms of the input to the bar normally associated with countersteering.  As I've said, I know many people who think all you do is lean, and any input they're giving to the bar is totally unconscious.  Whereas that may be sufficient to get you down the road under normal circumstances, possibly for years at a stretch, I can't think of anybody who'd argue that this is preferable to properly knowing how to manipulate the bar in a turn, regardless of what you want to call it.

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2) swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.  2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked to the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity from April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay Antenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to 11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.  3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment data; long term trend analysis is continuing.  6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation index is near the optimal level.  7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument. Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed during the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.  9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant changes (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:         a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 260 hours   GDS (Ground Data Systems):  1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21 (Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller (TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry Subsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The 10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was not metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS data from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of the TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.

EDT         THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen,  two months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our  national deficit and to increase our investment in the American  people, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget  plan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope  and opportunity in the country.                Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress,  which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed  the House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support  of a majority of the United States Senate.               All of these members of Congress know it's time to get  the economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a  fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.   Unfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate  have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working  the will of the majority on the jobs bill.              When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every  state and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue  is not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking  for full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't  care about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying  the rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the  table and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of  dignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their  families and drawing a paycheck.              They're asking those of us who have the privilege of  serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our  economy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working  with the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some  of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs  plan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on  jobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet  national needs.                Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.   Today I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what  size package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of  the American people.               But even as we make those reductions and the package  will be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the  minds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is  the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the  dramatic rise in violent crime.               So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an  additional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities  to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the  fiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a  matching effort by local governments, this could put as many as  10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in  communities all across our nation.              At a time when too many of our people live in fear of  violent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many  people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their  homes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments  America can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that  investment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.                I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep  the economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no  mistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I  ever have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight  for their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.              I want to thank the police officers who are here today  and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here  that I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to  rehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the  summer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to  talk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement  concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country  to have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and  a brighter and more peaceful future.              I say what I say today not just because it's good for  law enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in  these communities.  I have always supported community policing not  only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate,  but because it cements better relationships between people in law  enforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces  the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the  chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.              These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.   I promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put  another 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four  years.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind  the core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.                So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the  jobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if  you will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept  the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to  building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will  create real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my  part now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.                I want now to give the people who are here with me on  the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the  American people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished  Attorney General.                 *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *               Q   Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that  the jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over  the suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional  dialogue?              THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have -- they wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all,  I made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's  a lot of support in the business community and the labor community --  people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden  of the present system on many of our major employers, particularly  many of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the  strength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision  that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general  tax.              Q   Do you personally believe that the American public  is ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I  mean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --              THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I  will say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the  benefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is -- everyone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you  streamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that  there's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or  over-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive  care in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows  absolutely massive savings to the health care system.              The real question is whether you can transfer those  savings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have  virtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I  have no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is  the polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned,  they say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an  affordable health care system.              But I don't think that has anything to do with this  stimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first  and foremost.  They want that more than anything else.              Q   Now that you've announced your willingness to  compromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of  your package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer  jobs is one.              THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the  highway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let  me say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime  bill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a  supplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think  we need to do that.              I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the  enormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately  and disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people  with AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be  done.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the  safety of the public depends on that.                There are a number of other things that I don't -- I  don't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator  Mitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole  called me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call  him back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we  discussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said  that I would not make any statements about any specifics until at  least they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could  reach some accord.                So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been  already, and let's see if they can talk it out.              Q   When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator  Mitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200  million, that you want that as part of the package?              THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word  for Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator  Dole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.   But I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I  wanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a  reformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even  more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the  American people wanted us to address.  And this is certainly  consistent with that.              Thank you.\",\"Re: Problems with S3-initialization  As described the manual the following steps must be done for th initialization of the S3 card.

The way they were used at that time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched a complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It would be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league. Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1 through October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games than the other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that stretch. \",\"Not on my system.\",\"Anyone have any expierience with PSI's comstation 5?

Rest deleted.\",\" OpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great, portable interface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications. It is not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL means that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable.   If your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI sales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a shot.   As one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in 1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates sped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5 years. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ('85-'89), the PI ('88-'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D's - '86-'90), the Power Series parallel systems ('88-'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics architectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every 18 months to 2 years.  These are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become almost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new platform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths, faster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we don't, we become uncompetitive.  From the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today.  You can't wait to buy, but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep for one in writing. If it's feasible, they should be able to do that. Some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as the Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge R4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.   If that's happening, it's becausing of misunderstandings or mis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our customer base.   Most SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule slipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments.   Five years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processor technologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at least 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is really 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.  There are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don't give up, we know it.  Josh   |:-)  --  \",\" I think the original post was searching for existing implementations of f.i. Gouroud-shading of triangles. This is fairly complex to do with plain X. Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie where to get the latest version). For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(), what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff.

By default the parallel printer processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore no Int 0x0F's will be sourced from the printer controller chip, thus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7.       Note, this applies to COM ports also which by default do not route interrupts to the system bus, although COM's software usually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port activity easier than polling the serial UART, thus probably getting the sound card slighty confused!.\",\"That's very true.

The most recent research  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State University  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns are  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by criminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in this  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when you  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because of  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding private  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study of  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39% of  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime because  they believed that the intended victim was  armed., and  57% agreed that \\\"most criminals are more worried  about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.\\\"2      One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the women  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation that  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in response  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This should be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando Florida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960's  the  female populace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just the  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and obtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for that  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to experience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally, a 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes showed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion rate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun, the completion rate drops to 3%.   1 G Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America Aldine de Gruyter, NY, 1991 2 JD Wright & PH Rossi Armed and Considered Dangerous:  A Survey of Felons and Their Firearms, Aldine de Gruyter, NY, 1986 -------  __________________________________________________________________________ [unlike cats] dogs NEVER scratch you when you wash them.

Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations to Close Naval, Marine Reserve Centers  To: National Desk, Defense Writer  Contact: Herbert M. Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of           the United States, 202-479-2258     WASHINGTON, April 13 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Reserve Officers Association of the United States has alerted the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to give sufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers.    In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members of Congress with affected locations in their constituencies, including Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine list ignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior service personnel.    ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.), suggested \\\"concern that the only plausible alternative is that they are intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve components from maintaining even today's relatively low level of participation in their parent service's Total Force of the future.\\\"    He asked the commission \\\"to remove from consideration all locations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to warrant approval of the requested action.\\\"    \\\"Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve installations on this list are large enough to have a significant impact on the community, if closed,\\\" wrote Hultman.  \\\"The major issue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large percentage of the existing locations.\\\"    Hultman reminded the commission, \\\"The fact that the vast majority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come close to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this process certainly supports the thesis\\\" that these actions are simply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve.    ROA also noted \\\"that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of Naval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480 Naval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations are approved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities.\\\"    Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging from South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 Naval Reserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., to Missoula and Great Falls. Mont.  Naval/Marine Corps Reserve Centers include four in San Francisco, Fort Wayne, Ind., Billings, Mont., and Abilene, Texas.

Ken\",\"[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.]  Gun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day with a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30. It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began, whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.  Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of \\\"election fraud\\\" to hold their jobs.  Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too many cases, who they were).  Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater of Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident.  The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner Auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive husbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room.  One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy. He said, \\\"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is always so organized every year.\\\"  I got a little pissed, and replied, \\\"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.\\\"  At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and several Simon's Rock anti-gun \\\"close-the-loophole\\\" protestors. (Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)  The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.  Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up to \\\"support GOAL's position\\\" on \\\"all bills.\\\"  First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students had some curfew, I guess).    Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock folks called the current law a \\\"loophole\\\" and wanted it closed.  Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \\\"SKS assault rifle.\\\" The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri, and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \\\"as strong as\\\" that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.  Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  \\\"In some of these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!\\\" (Oooooo!)  \\\"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't be having this situation -- but they won't.\\\"  (Naughty, naughty!)  Next up was Boston city councilman Albert \\\"Dapper\\\" O'Neill.  He was there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were judge, he'd give arrestees their \\\"last rights\\\" (pun intended) on the spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.) He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(  Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction -- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying, \\\"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted.\\\"  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.  Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable every five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible. \\\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\\\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the law-abiding instead of the crook.  The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga. Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \\\"restraining order\\\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He  was a co-sponsor of one of the \\\"restraining order\\\" bills as well.)  One of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \\\"every year it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\\\" It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been more effective.  At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue. Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was disconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \\\"public\\\" testimony; the other got a seat this time.  Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change. He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great quote: \\\"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state computer system until 1999.\\\"  (This was also an argument he used against the renewable FID card.)  Testimony was heard from several \\\"battered women,\\\" one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he got it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how 50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women needed to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long rambling circumlocution in response.  Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts. Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.  Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law. One of the junior reps noted that \\\"this is America\\\" and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga reiterated this, saying that \\\"people who abuse smaller people can go to Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order.\\\"  (Point and match, Senator.)  Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his citizenship \\\"expired every 5 years,\\\" and that a driver's license was a privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.  A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public hangings.  The speaker then responded, \\\"I'll make you a deal.  You get me the rope, and I'll tie the noose.\\\"  Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \\\"he wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside\\\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \\\"loophole\\\" should be closed to prevent something like this from \\\"ever happening again\\\".  Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of spilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually shot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on, saying, \\\"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are safe -- support gun control.\\\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \\\"Only residents can get FID's,\\\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out-of-staters completely off?)  Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by out-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident student -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental record.  One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \\\"elitist\\\".  Another (Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union had \\\"FID-type\\\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home state was \\\"not enough.\\\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming, \\\"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!\\\"  All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and GOAL's position) were:  o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull     licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)  o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)  o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly    opposed)  o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws     (opposed)  o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)  o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)  o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)  o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)  o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)  Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.  Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.  Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it. Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said, \\\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\\\"  The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It ended at about 6:30. -- \",\"   Tell me, 'kmagnacca', were you high on 'Arromdian of ASALA/SDPA/ARF' when you wrote that? Humane behavior and tolerance of Turks was a legend even 500 years ago when they accepted tens of thousands of  Jews from Spain who were fleeing from the Spanish Inquisition. Again,  many Jewish families escaping from Nazi Armenians and Hitler's Nazi  Germany took refugee in Turkiye during the 1940's. Turkish people have unselfishly given home, protection, and freedom to the Jews over  the centuries, including to thousands and thousands of them during  the Second World War.

And one recalls that the Jews took up their abode in 'fanatic' Turkey  when they were expelled from Europe, especially Spain, by Saintly Christians,  and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and  liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects, all being exposed alike to the  rapacity of their common rulers. To one brought up, as most Americans have   been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of   the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious  differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they  were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every   nation in the world would have treated as treasonable. One readily   reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate...\\\"   He also stated that:  \\\"they [Armenians] traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian   invader; that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and  fifty thousand men to fight a civil war, and that they burned at least  a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population.\\\"                   TURKEY AND THE HOLOCAUST  An  interview  with  Stanford  J. Shaw  (History),  who  recently completed  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the Turkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in Rescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution, 1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree program in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for the Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the G. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.  Editor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and European and Turkish Jews?  Shaw: Basically, I'm  an Ottoman historian, but  I'm also Jewish. I've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as time went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews, I collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a couple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the 500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and coming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire Avenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman Jewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became motivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The Jews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book is quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who tend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint of the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish sources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I approach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of view of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I finished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across additional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War II. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good deal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not actually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in the Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish diplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It was too late to add this new information to the book in press, so I decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research, mainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the Turkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second book, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped rescue Jews from the Nazis.  - How exactly did they do this?  The story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents the material in three parts, first of which deals with the period before the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in 1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi Germans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and the like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of reforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were being fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new talent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three months  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey arranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and were   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish universities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical personnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors came to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political scientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in Turkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the Berlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist, came to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics in Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the Nazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually came to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other German Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey. One  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical producer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to Turkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the Turkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul Hindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first phase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by Turkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in Turkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded themselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in the anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I even  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey praising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting the idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been persecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the Nazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The second part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in 1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and especially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They had migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of the century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the Turkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was threatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews throughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might happen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled to France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their Turkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the Nazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of anti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not worth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot to be a Turkish Jew.  - How so?  Turkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained its embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries until it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the end of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position to  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the actions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of the  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in particular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from the Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish citizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were arrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats would  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other officials and say in effect:  \\\"These people are Turkish citizens. You  can't do  this  to  them.\\\" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be released.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.  The Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey. They hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion of the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and manganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they usually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews. The Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps to secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded trains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and succeeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews were sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in Paris,  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish consuls took place.  The greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned their  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The consuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizens because  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews lining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get passports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their Turkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so processing the application would take  some time. In the meantime it was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on the streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them if they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because radios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of these  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a document called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  \\\"irregular fellow citizen.\\\" The  document said in  effect \\\"This person is  a former Turkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his Turkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if you  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.\\\"  The diplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on it. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they accepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this means, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who had relinquished their Turkish citizenship.  Actually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of Jews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to retain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these interventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all Jews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to prevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz before the Turkish consuls could do anything.  - Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?  There were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War II,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the information in this section of  the book relates to the situation in France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls sent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in reply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would present  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are Turkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the Nazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish consuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from Nazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran regularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas so they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were often  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern Europe  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these governments really didn't want the Jews to escape. As a result of the Turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish Jews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to Auschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either escaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of southern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much better than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy fell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well. Incidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also worked to rescue Jews in that country.  - The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats acting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin from Nazi persecution.  Yes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their interventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their treaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German territory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey. On  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not discriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis claimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not discriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally. Turkey  protested,   saying,  \\\"You  are  dividing   our  citizens according to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that all  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion. Therefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews.\\\" American consuls in  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told American Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they couldn't do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were being treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book takes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the Holocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European Jews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in Palestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in Istanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other Jewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also sent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These groups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out what was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at that  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on. They  didn't imagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the first step was to get information, and the Turkish government let them use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and friends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out what was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the Nazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received assistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who served as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to 1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican representative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the Catholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was doing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern Europe.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these agencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even railroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren't able to help much in Poland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the Polish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for the Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the so called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through the Black Sea to Istanbul.  Turkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its borders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was suffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The government,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the non-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by the Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and Palestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean from southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly opposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did not want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they feared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British constantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic and send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government, yielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For example, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700 Jewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish government  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British ambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all were lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish government allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to pass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during the Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these refugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to send money and food out of the country.  - Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be living in Israel.  Yes, and  their children. But  let's return  for a moment  to the first group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not go  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the non-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en route to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.  - And you have rescued it from obscurity.  Many studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do not focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of the scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of whom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a much smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the picture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to undertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.  When it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively small in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The rescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so significant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were murdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.  About  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  - translations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the story is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware of  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the people of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would not  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they could see the documents.  - What languages are used in the documents?  Most of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There is a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of the boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I did not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what Turkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A few documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did not necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in fact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying to  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For example, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency was  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in helping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President Roosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had been an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New York City, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The documents related to his mission are in English.  I also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust historian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His father was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had gathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn't personally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more can  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone someday will make the effort.  - This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it?  Right. I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the Ottoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In addition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I've been actively involved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the coming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I helped organize  a large international conference  on the subject which was held in Istanbul in 1992.  - Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken place, what do you plan to do next?  I'm working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War for Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the years  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the victorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its independence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid II, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an important modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed all sorts of political movements.  Stanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in British History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning a second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate at Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School of  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the University of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the University of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to UCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute in  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National Endowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He has  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and Bosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor for lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish studies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and Culture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in Washington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional service activities and public lectures  in both the United States and Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited volume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2 vols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or reprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983, 1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York University Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation by the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the Holocaust: Turkey's  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry from Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan Publishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.  A pamphlet summarizing the book was published in Ankara, Turkey, in 1992.

In another part of this thread, you've been telling us that the \\\"goal\\\" of a natural morality is what animals do to survive.  But suppose that your omniscient being told you that the long term survival of humanity requires us to exterminate some  other species, either terrestrial or alien.  Does that make it moral to do so?\",\"NUT CASE PANICS!!!!JUMPS THE GUN ON THE NET BEFORE GETTING FACTS STRAIGHT!!!! \",\" Now, that indeed is possible.  A good friend of mine is running about 1 KW PeP from his car.  Yes, he does have a second alternator.  Yes, he calls the rig an \\\"electronic brake\\\" since the engine noticeably slows when the key is down.  My car, unfortunately, has so much computer junk under the hood that it's astonishingly sensitive to RFI.  If I key a 2W HT over the engine with the hood open, the car loses timing due to the RF leaking into the  distributor pickup.  Very poor design.  I will, however, point out that ham radio operators are usually quite willing to help when interference is detected.  Remember that any interference is wasted power; if I put out 1W in the TV band, that's 1W that I am not putting out in the band I am trying to transmit on, and 1W can often be the difference between a nice card hanging on the wall, and nothing.  CBers, however, are usually not as helpful.  Most illegal CBers, however, will stop operation when you inform them of a problem.  The rest of them will stop operation when you inform the local FCC office of the problem (in writing, and giving details and addresses). \",\"    There are many teams in the NHL who have taken a liking to Russian players. The \\\"whole Russian strategy\\\" is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano, who was GM before Murray.  What the previous GM also did was to trade  away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, most notably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years with Philly after leaving here.  Also, it's not the volume of trades that will  necessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a  great player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly to the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by  injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered).  Put Scotty Bowman, Pat Burns, or any of the other better coaches in the  league behind the bench of this Detroit team, and they could beat anybody.\",\"I change login passwords every couple of months.

My biggest concern isn't that the escrow house could be compromised (it will be), but the fact it has been compromised will be kept secret.    The keys could be kept under glass, with 24-hour C-SPAN coverage.  If you thought your key had been stolen just turn on the cable, and wait until the roving camera reachs the musuem case with your key.  Or if you think the C-SPAN satellite has been compromised, take a tour of the Smithsonian yourself, and view the seal on your key. \",\"Wanted:  color monitor >= 14\\\"  suitable for use on a Macintosh Centris 610.

Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to 3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).  A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.  - A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull   the trigger again. - A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,   but will fire merely by pulling the trigger. - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again   to rotate to the next round. - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the   hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an   easy motion, even one handed. - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines   on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.  - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell   first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often   lost as you realize \\\"hey, it's jammed!\\\" before starting to do anything   about clearing it. - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round   and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the    chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider   this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed   of employment as a revolver. - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of   operation of many of them requires more training.  Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having accidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks require rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a VCR.  Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter and pay attention. I do not seek here to say \\\"semi-autos are junk\\\" merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot.  Gun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a  wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything. Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit. I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit what I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously wrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than 5.  What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple .38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police  prefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....  ObPlea: Don't flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things. But they          introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking         as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal. \",\"Archive-name: space/acronyms Edition: 8  Acronym List for sci.astro, sci.space, and sci.space.shuttle: Edition 8, 1992 Dec 7 Last posted: 1992 Aug 27  This list is offered as a reference for translating commonly appearing acronyms in the space-related newsgroups.  If I forgot or botched your favorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there's an acronym *not* on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure it out, I'll add it to the list.  Note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen* acronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporated every acronym I ever saw, I'd soon run out of disk space!  :-)  The list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  All comments regarding it are welcome; I'm reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.  Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you're on your own for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of acronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that are essentially always explained as they're introduced are omitted. Further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of the list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they're simply different ways of referring to the same thing.  Thanks to everybody who's sent suggestions since the first version of the list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu), who is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in character than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de), who is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and terms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).  Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA Reference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and Associated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly mammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.  Special Bonus!  At the end of this posting, you will find a perl program written by none other than Larry Wall, whose purpose is to scramble the acronym list in an entertaining fashion.

The particular need in this case is for three machines, each in a different office of the same building, each having access to a Windows-based accounting system.  My first thought is to set up MS Windows for Workgroups on each of the machines (likely a 486 and two 386's) along with the appropriate Ethernet cards and cabling that come with the Windows for Workgroups starter kit (one additional user kit will be necessary).  It then seems logical to purchase a simple multi-user accounting system, along the lines of DacEasy or M.Y.O.B., and fire it all up!  The 486 will more or less act as server with a report/check printer attached to it. Cable runs of 30-40 feet will be necessary for this setup.  Well, this all seems too easy to me.  Would any of you network gurus out there tell me if I am out of my mind here?  Any and all suggestions, however trivial, will be immensely appreciated.

My department has been given a large sum of money to install a video system on our network of IBM RS6000 workstations.  This is not an area in which I have any expertise, so I wonder if anyone out there can offer advice.  We would like a system, based either on VHS or 8mm video which will allow one  write video, frame by frame on tape for play-back in real time.  It's for visualization of physics problems.  Can anyone tell me what hardware is available which would work for our system?  Some support software is obviously needed too, but nothing particularly sophisticated, since the software we actually use for the visualization is all already written.

NAPOLEON****************** *******************************************************   ** There were a couple millions of Greeks living in Asia Minor **until 1923 Someone had to protect them. If not us who??   Is that so? or you were taking advantage of weakness of ottoman empire to grab some land. As soon as you got green lights from allied forces, you occupied Izmir and other cities in western Turkey. You killed and  raped millions people without any reason. Of course, you paid the price. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk made you swim in aegean sea but not far enough. Your aggressions thru Turkey at anytime in the past did not get you any reward and shall not get you anywhere.   **Compromise on what, the invasion of Cyprus, the involment of Turkey in **Greek politics, the refusal of Turkey to accept 12 miles of territorial **waters as stated by international law, the properties of the Greeks of **Konstantinople, the ownership of the islands in the Greek lake,sorry, Aegean.   What compromise are you talking about on Cyprus. That is not Greece business to join the island to Greece. That is up to people in the island to live or not to live together. They made their decision and they are living  separetely now.There is a peace there. Greeks can't slaughter Turks anymore because turkish peacemaking force is there. Your dream will never come true. 12 mile territorialwater!!!! Are you joking or dreaming? We can declare our 12 miles territorial water which can come close to Athens. How would you like it? If you have any guts why don't you shoot at some Turkish ships in your dream 12 mile territorial waters? We do not have any city called Konstantinople. We have a city called ISTANBUL!!!! All the greeks in Istanbul are being treated just any other Turks. There is no difference among people in Turkey. You look at your own backyard first before talking about human rights in Turkey. What are the rights of Turks in Greece? Nothing. They do not even have basic human rights like right to have property, fredom of religion, fredom of press, fredom of vote elect their community leaders. Government of Greece publicly encourages people to destroy and burn schools, religious places, houses, and farms belong to turkish minority. Then, Greek government forces these minorities to go to Turkey without anything with them. You will dream to see Aegean sea as Greek lake but it will never happen. Think about the war between Turkey and Greece in 1915. The river called SAKARYA flood 21 days filled with blood in 1915.    **Any person who supports the policies of the Turkish goverment **directly or indirecly is a \\\"bad\\\" person. **It is not your nationality that makes you bad, it is your support **of the actions of your goverment that make you \\\"bad\\\". **People do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you **are. You are a supporter of the policies of the Turkish goverment and **as a such you must pay the price.   You mean that any person who supports the actions and policies of the government of Greece is a good person. That is your Greek idea to say Turks are bad people. We know who we are and proud to be TURKS anywhere in the world. That is not Greeks business to tell us what kind of people we are. You are not at position to judge people because you are not civilized enough to give equal rights to your own minorities. Millions of minorities are being treated as third class citizen, their rights are taken away from them, and they have no voices under the Government of Greece. They are almost being treated as slaves even though we are getting into 21th century. Therefore, do not make me laught at you.    **You do not need brainwashing to turn people against the Turks.Just **as Greeks, Arats, Slavs, Kurds and all other people who had **the luck to be under Turkish occupation. **They will talk to you about murders,rapes,distruction. **You do not learn about Turks from history books, you learn about **them from people who experienced first hand Turkish friendliness.  The Government of Greece is actively supporting terrorism against Turkey.Armenian and Kurdish terrorists have headquarters in Athens. They are being trained in special camps in Greece. They are taught how to kill innocent women and children.This not a claim, this is a fact known by whole world. In conlusion, you are in action to murder, rape, destroy the innocent people. I do not take you seriously because you are not at any positions to talk about human rights and dignity. Your own government, the Government of Greece actively supports atrocities in Bosnia. Serbs's Barbarism pleases your government. Please Napoleon think twice before you write anything about Turks and Turkey. You are the worst in human right conditions and treatment of the minorities. Who wants to be a fried with someone whose government does not respect the human rights, supports terrorism in Turkey,barbaric actions in Bosnia, treats Turkish minorities as third class citizen and take away all of their rights, treating them as slaves at the beginning of 21th century???????

Thanks in advance for any opinions and or experiences \",\" I really don't understand all this!  I watched on satellite network feeds as   perhaps 90 people died before my eyes, while the two Huey's fanned the flames,   and the FBI stopped the firetrucks at the gate.   Something was VERY wrong with that scene.  Perhaps if I'd watched RAMBO movies, I might've been dulled to the pain of   fellow humans dying.  Thank GOD I still feel.  I'm very sorry for you who don't.  For you who think   they got what they deserved.  Can you really believe that?  Even if Koresh was   the sadistic mad man they said he was, did the others deserve his fate?   If,   in fact, he was mad, wasn't that even more reason to believe he duped his   followers, and therefore they were innocent, brainwashed, victims?  Is there   any scenaro that justifies all that death?  And if not, it is clear that the deaths would not have occured if the BATF has   not FUCKED UP initially, and now the FBI got impaitent and pushed Korech over   the edge.  And that's if you buy the latest version of the \\\"story\\\" hook, line, and sinker.    I have believed all along that they could not let them live, the embarrassment   to the BATF and the FBI would've been too severe.  Remember, this was a suspicion of tax-evasion warrant.  There were no   witnesses, except the FBI.  All information filtered through the FBI.  All they   had to do was allow one remote controlled pool camera be installed near the   building, and the press could've done their job, and would've been able to back   the FBI's story with close up video, while incurring no risk to the press.    Unless they did not want the public to see something.  The complete lack of any   other source of information other than the FBI really causes me concern.    Sick to my stomach, and getting sicker from all the Government apologists -- jmd@handheld.com\",\" Only my common sense.  The fire was caused by either Koresh and his followers or by the FBI/ATF/CIA/KGB/and maybe the Harper Valley PTA.  Since you are throwing around the evidence arguement, I'll throw it back.  Can you prove any government agency did it?  (Please don't resort to \\\"they  covered it up so that proves they did it\\\" or any wild theories about how the government agencies intentionally started the fire.  The key words are proof and evidence.) proves they did it\\\"   Please explain how Koresh was defending himself from those children who burned.   \",\"I remember reading about a program that made windows icons run away from the mouse as it moved near them.

Hi, I'm new to this group so please bear with me!  Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation of raster files. With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView. I put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage() is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the Sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory pixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that: (1) the X protocol communication is slowing things down; or (2) XPutImage is inefficient...or both! My question is, what is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to a window? Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is running on the same machine as the server? Or am I stuck with XPutImage() (in which case I might as well give up now...)?  All help appreciated...thanks!

Helsingius?   * * *  _____ <8.1> What are some known anonymous remailing and posting sites?    Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites   is anon.penet.fi operated by julf@penet.fi for several months, who   has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment.    Including anonymized mail, Usenet posting, and return addresses    (no encryption).  Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.     Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk   remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):   pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX   scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to   aid remailer use).    ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu   -----------------------------     Anonymized mail.  Request information from above address.        elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu   -------------------------     Experimental anonymous remailer run Karl Barrus     <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU>, with encryption to the server.

Request information from above address.    phantom@mead.u.washington.edu    -----------------------------     Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site     address for information.    Notes   =====      - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often     running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues     are wholly unresolved.      - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP     software (see the question on cryptography).     - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)     vary between sites.    - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are     mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.  _____ <8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?       Users   -----    - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the     seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.   - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.   - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on     Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.   - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.     Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases     network traffic.   - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this     is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'     hierarchy is preferred.   - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.     references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for     readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any     inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even     future ones under the same handle.   - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your     identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by     sending anonymized mail to yourself.   - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them.      Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.   - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.   - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.     Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.   - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large     amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating     his hardware, all for your convenience.    Operators   ---------    - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an     introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and     consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and     monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and     security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or     lassaiz-faire?   - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate     potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user     is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user     posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your     users trust you to protect them.   - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations     where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.     warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke     the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)   - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.     Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly     and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with     users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under     ``(in)stability of anonymity''.   - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?     What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is     your commitment to it?   - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an     address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item.      Consult a lawyer about your liability.   - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared     to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you     do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system     adminstrator, consult those who do and are.   - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If     possible, query group readers.   - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message     format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure     the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.   - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from     physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.    Readers   -------      - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason     that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that     equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail     anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its     volume is heavy or increasing).   - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters     will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate     responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.   - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,     harassment, extortion, etc.   - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they     offend you personally.   - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the     idea of anonymity itself.   - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings     should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or     `conceivable' need exists.    References   ----------      See e.g. ftp.eff.org:/pub/academic/anonymity:    > This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual   > privacy and the use of handles.  It accepts the need of a system   > operator to know the name of a user; but suggests that the use of   > a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a   > letter to the editor. The article concludes with a set of   > guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous.  _____ <8.3> How do I `kill' anonymous postings?    James Thomas Green <jgreen@zeus.calpoly.edu>:    > Try putting this in your kill file:   >      >   /Anon/h:j   >   /Anonymous/h:j   >    > This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that   > contain `Anon' or `Anonymous' in them.  Not perfect and won't   > kill followups.       Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask   anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so   far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common   as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.    _____ <8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?    Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for   individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is   almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion   and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack   started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was   wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)   but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided   anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up   the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous   alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through   servers like there's no tomorrow.''      Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in   researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste   <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system   from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the   server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,   and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by   multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended   advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group   support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was   arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.''    K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an   anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus   against it.     K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to   `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and   used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of   intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his   server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to   abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the   facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was   created.''    In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most   controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on   scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized   mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine   the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide   accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.      J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet   newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological   opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).   Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,   abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than   ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of   anonymity is also controversial.    For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb   1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate   crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via   anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been   posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then   non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a   New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of   vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating   through many newsgroups.       The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded   that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''   suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was   not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of   the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived   association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries   for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous   user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his   detractors.    Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal   opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news   operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire   extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the   scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is   best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users   in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a   day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized   through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due   to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to   find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.    Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to   dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste   threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate   news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages   originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to   threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several   times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it   by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5   hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the   service's administration. In response to the serious threats he   disabled global group access temporarily for one week and   encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.      Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by   ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security   weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is   currently in the process of code development and testing. He is   planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon   to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new   system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple   email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,   etc.    A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.   1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography   in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of   confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public   access account, and he had to shut it down after only several   weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately   originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the   software to the public domain.    Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on   government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and   group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the   group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,   and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable   digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in   the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to   attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing   easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and   encryption.

Here are two from Black Sabbath's \\\"Master of Reality\\\".  I'll say this much for the music of the '60's and early '70's, at least they asked questions of significance.  Jethro Tull is another to asked and wrote about things that caused one to wonder. --Rex]   AFTER FOREVER  Have you ever thought about your soul--      can it be saved? Or perhaps you think that when you're dead      you just stay in you grave. Is God just a thought within you read in a book      when you were at school? When you think about death       Do you lose your breath      Or do you keep your cool?  Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope? Do you think he's a fool? Well I have seen the truth.  Yes I have seen the light      and I've changed my ways. And I'll be prepared       When you're lonely and scared      at the end of your days.  Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say If they knew you believed in God above? They should realize before they criticise That God is the only way to love.   Is your mind so small that you have to fall In with the pack wherever they run? Will you still sneer when death is near And say they may as well worship the sun?  I think it was true -it was people like you      that crucified Christ. I think it is sad the opinion you had      was the only one voiced. Will you be so sure when your day is near      to say you don't believe? You had the chance but you turned it down      now you can't retrieve. Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead & gone Open your eyes, just realize that He is the one. The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate. Or will you still jeer at all you hear? Yes!  I think it's too late.   LORD OF THIS WORLD\",\"This is a periodic posting intended to answer the Frequently Asked Question: What is the DoD? It is posted the first of each month, with an expiration time of over a month. Thus, unless your site's news software is ill-mannered, this posting should always be available. This WitDoDFAQ is crossposted to all four rec.motorcycles groups in an attempt to catch most new users, and followups are directed to rec.motorcycles.  Last changed 9-Feb-93 to add a message from the KotL, and a bit of Halon.     VERSION 1.1  This collection was originally assembled by Lissa Shoun, from the original postings. With Lissa's permission, I have usurped the title of KotWitDoDFAQ.

If the most Frequently Asked Question in rec.motorcycles is \\\"What is the DoD?\\\", then the second most Frequently Asked Question must be \\\"How do I get a DoD number?\\\" That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List (KotL, accept no substitue Keepers) for a number. If you're feeling creative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can make a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non- base-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not that you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)  Oh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'll just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole net, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.  By now you're probably asking \\\"So who's the KotL already?\\\". Well, as John Sloan notes below, that's about the only real \\\"secret\\\" left around here, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself, nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was the original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the KotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely with hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line- oriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting messages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with \\\"weenie mailers\\\"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a Dead-Head.  ***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************  Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically groveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed work for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting something done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!) days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of economic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yet another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it just makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an excersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request was submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think the KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).  ***********************************************************************  One more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what they used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya? The typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, & e-mail address. For example:  0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM  (PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only requirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, as there are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)  Blaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner   blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com  ------------------------------------------------------------------------              \\\"Denizens of Doom\\\", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)        [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce's permission]  There is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal  things that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and   motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,   helmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve seats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy,  traffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double  entendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They  argue with each other and plan rides together.  The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that,  although they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each  other face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world  and communicate with each other electronically via computer.  The computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;   the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry  professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently,  rec.motorcycles (pronounced \\\"wreck-dot-motorcycles,\\\" it's the file name for  the group's primary on-line \\\"meeting place\\\") carries about 2250 articles per  month;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent  posters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred  to as the DoD.  The DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of  parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer  enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, \\\"Denizen  of Doom.\\\"  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of  the Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of  course, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.  The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules  appealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the  List, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been  almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and  Canada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France,  Germany, Norway and Finland.  Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run  of 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the  American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser --  selling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a  few months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were  donated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500  to the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs  in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.  As often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go  riding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of  DoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's  \\\"Silicon Valley.\\\"  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on  Rollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California  \\\"Joust.\\\"  The Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big  barbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern  California ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north,  meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan  for 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction  with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.  Though it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective  communications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional  motorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in  search of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to  get together.  Long may they flame.   \\\"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live\\\" [centerbar]  This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which  you can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do  anything like that face to face.  These insults are known as \\\"flames\\\";   issuing them is called \\\"flaming.\\\"  Flames often start when a member  disagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A  typical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be  something like:  \\\"What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad  poseur!\\\"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense  of the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding  ability and your cat.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------            _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_                    by John Sloan  DoD #0011  Periodically the question \\\"What is DoD?\\\" is raised. This is one of those questions in the same class as \\\"Why is the sky blue?\\\", \\\"If there is a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?\\\" and \\\"Why do women inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they dump you?\\\", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition, and philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion by philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the halls of academe for generations.   A long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on a computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two machines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another via a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but who was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of the various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and signed it \\\"The Denizen of Doom\\\". Not wishing to identify himself, he asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time become DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking individual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed.   He who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was the funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty easily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership number.   Perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a motorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or make or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized electronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a part of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a gestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight ratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open minded enough to accept us as members.   In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have never met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet feel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized and run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the network via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list (often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the same region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating around the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by #11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and distributed on VHS by #18)!   Where will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races, placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine management computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards? Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal room and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell.   The DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net access and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only ask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few really good club secrets). New members will receive via email a membership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which includes name, state, and email address.   The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least until next year when we may decided to change the name).

The Names have been changes to protect the Guilty (riders) and Innocent (the bikes) alike. If you think you recognize a contorted version of your name, you don't. It's just your guilt complex working against you. Read 'em and weep.   We tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. Terrible Barbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to Reverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection:   Terrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!!   Muck: I don't mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW      crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer      11 but what the heck.    Stompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that's all man.  Terrible: Nahhhh, you're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at      least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor!      Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a      Woosh-a-stream.  Stompin: You mean Wee-Stream.  Terrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements???  Stompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let's see      what they say, eh?   Muck: Now men, let's try to be civil about this.  High Tech: Hi, I'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.  Arlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!  Terrible: B.T.???  Arlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.  Muck: Ahhh, look, you're making Terrible gag.  Terrible: What does BMW stand for anyway???   Muck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.  Terrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don't know either.  Muck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear.  Chunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear!  Terrible: Hey, didn't you drop your BMW???  Chunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean       even Villy Ogle flamed me for that!   Muck: It's okay, we all makes mistakes.  Out of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange with Dill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller and the perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush!   Heritick: Heya Terrible, how's yer front to back bias?  Terrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW?  Heritick: Nahhh.  Hooter: Hoot, Hoot.  Buck: Nice tree Hooter, how'd ya get up there?  Hooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!!  Muck: What's a carbujector?  Hooter: Well, it ain't made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!!  Muck: Ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!  Dill: Well, where do we race?  Snob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't      ride!   Muck: No! No! Quiet!  Tread: BMW's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.      They even have luggage made by Sourkraut!  High: My 9 too!  Terrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!!  Stompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!!  Before this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more cohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the infamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin!   Polyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like      I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting      it up on the ole ventral stand!    Terrible: Hopalonga's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka's and      Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too!   Booster: I hate Cavortin.  All: WE KNOW, WE KNOW.  Booster: I love Cavortin.  All: WE KNOW WE KNOW.  Muck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras?  Snob, Tread: Nawwwwww.  Muck: What about a Tridump?  Terrible: Isn't that a chewing gum?  Muck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity?  Heritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?  Muck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make.  Two more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter. Pill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.  Phalanx: Hey, I don't know about that.  And Now even more west coasters pour in. Road O'Noblin: Hopalonga's are the greatest!  Maulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector!  Suddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth: Kite Lanolin: Hey, BMW's are great, men.  Robo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.  More riders from the west coast come into the discussion: Aviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.  Guess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison.  With a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. It was none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn.  Clean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns.   Muck: Why??  Clean: Well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.  Muck: But I only have a 4-banger.  Clean: No GOOD!  Chunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!  Clean: Inferior!  Stompin: Hey, look, here's proof BMW's are better. The Bimmer-Boys burst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me a thrill...   Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for?   Heritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT'S ME,      WILHEM!   Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don't you mean BMW?   And so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the thunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them all boomed out. G.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding      Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions.   All: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease.  Does this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding mini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?  Tune in next week for the next gut wretching episode of \\\"The Yearning and Riderless\\\" with its ever increasing cast of characters.  Where all technical problems will be flamed over until well done.  Next week's episode will answer the question of: \\\"To Helmet or Not to Helmet\\\" will be aired, this is heady material and viewer discretion is advised.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------            Script for the Denizens of Doom Anthem Video                  by Jonathan E. Quist   DoD #94   [Scene:  A sterile engineering office.  A lone figure, whom we'll call Chuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat, with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.]   (editor's note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at the First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizens referring to each other as \\\"Chuck\\\". I guess you had to be there. I wasn't.)   Chuck:  I didn't want to be a Software Systems Analyst,  cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,  may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted  to live a man's life, [Music slowly builds in background]  riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes  and the deepest valleys,  living the life of a Motorcyclist;  doing donuts and evading the police;  terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;  eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short,   I Want to be      A Denizen!  [Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with fringe), boots, and cap.  Scene simultaneously changes to the top of an obviously assaulted Rollins Pass.  A small throng of Hell's Angels sit on their Harleys in the near background, gunning their engines, showering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil on the tarmac.  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat Boy.]   Chuck [Sings to the tune of \\\"The Lumberjack Song\\\"]:  I'm a Denizen and I'm okay, I flame all night and I ride all day.  [Hell's Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]: He's a Denizen and he's okay, He flames all night and he rides all day.  I ride my bike; I eat my lunch; I go to the lavat'ry. On Wednesdays I ride Skyline, Running children down with glee.  [Chorus]: He rides his bike; He eats his lunch; He goes to the lavat'ry. On Wednesdays he rides Skyline, Running children down with glee.  [Chorus refrain]: 'Cause He's a Denizen...  I ride real fast, My name is Chuck, It somehow seems to fit. I over-rate the worst bad f*ck, But like a real good sh*t.  Oh, I'm a Denizen and I'm okay! I flame all night and I ride all day.  [Chorus refrain]: Oh, He's a Denizen...

[Chorus refrain]  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                      Why you have to be killed.  Well, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed to read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started as a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.  Sometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: \\\"What does DoD stand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it?\\\" Naturally, a Denizen who had watched the movie \\\"Top Gun\\\" a few times too many rose to the occasion and replied:  \\\"That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you.\\\"  And the rest is history.  A variation on the \\\"security\\\" theme is to supply disinformation about what DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where known) include:  Daughters of Democracy (DoD 23)  Doers of Donuts Dancers of Despair (DoD 9)  Debasers of Daughters Dickweeds of Denver   Driveway of Death Debauchers of Donuts   Dumpers of Dirtbikes  Note that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be limited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                       The rec.moto.photo archive  First a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck Rogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made, and several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in unknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not only provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.  Not only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk at their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the server too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages, the general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.  Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how to use the archive.  **********************************************************  Via ftp:  cerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]  Via e-mail:  The address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the message.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The arguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For rec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:  dir [dod] send [dod]bruce_tanner.gif send [dod]dodframe.ps  and you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts of bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.  Oh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to the next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of 50K each; not a good idea. --  Bruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDU Cerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner  **********************************************************  A couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so why not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful? Second, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind of you to access it after normal working hours (California time).   ------------------------------------------------------------------------                        Patches? What patches?  You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches & pins. And your reaction was probably: \\\"I want!\\\", or \\\"That's sick!\\\", or perhaps \\\"That's sick! I want!\\\"  Well, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that there's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad news is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn't because of any \\\"exclusivity\\\" attempt, but simply because there is no \\\"DoD store\\\" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by individual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is someone says \\\"I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost $xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?\\\" Then orders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the pre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a DoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all this is anarchy in action.  Here's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and perpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99), motorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts (DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and patches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by popular demand].  All \\\"profits\\\" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association Motorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been contributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum, you'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of \\\"Denizens of Doom, USENET, The World\\\", complete with a DoD pin.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Here's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.  ~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles ~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu> ~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum ~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT  I received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum, the other day.  \\\"Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:  Congratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the Denizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated is now $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitude to all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presently being prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to  see the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way, I will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.

Rides:  Summer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third year, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass trip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got together for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north as NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of North Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great Pacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for riding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have come to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]  Also worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the Moab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up, riding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal 2-strokes.  And though it's not an \\\"official\\\" (as if anything could be official with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races in Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters to gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah. European Denizens have staged some gathers too.

I first heard about it in this newsgroup  several years ago, and I have just got hold of a book, \\\"How to improve your sight - simple daily drills in relaxation\\\", by Margaret D. Corbett,  ('Authorized instructor of the Bates method), published in 1953.  It  talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  Has there been any study on whether this method actually works?  If it works, is it by  actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasing  the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the  too-long eyeball?  Since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the most logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process, i.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  Has there been any recent studies on this?  Where can I find them?  I know RK works by  changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of  eyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the  eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Bates's  idea, right?)\",\" Apple uses the IEEE Nubus-90 standard for their 32 bit backplane bus.

I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doing the talking.  And when you pray, you pray to God.  And the Spirit is God.  So, the Spirit is talking to Himself.  Which is why I only go by the Pentecost use where it's an actual language.  Moreover, the phrase \\\"though I speak with the tongues of men and angels\\\" used by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would then assume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, it is no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.  Hmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see how God PUNISHED by giving us different language.  Can we assume then that if angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME one amongst other angels?  After all, THEY were not punished in any manner.  So why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE ANOTHER?  It's disturbing to think that some people find ways to  justify jabbering.  But I'll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned.  Trouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts at verification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that the witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outright fabrication was involved.

If the power fails, big deal -  the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but  there's something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it  takes a while).  If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter, why not do it all the time?  Then there'd be no switchover to screw things up, and no having to sense the failure fast.

Note: I think Cylink is great, and if my boss would double my salary, I'd buy  a bunch of their stuff :).  One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability, at a higher degree of  security than we currently have in non-proprietary voice encryption systems. This means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme, and easier to  deploy.  This is, of course, either a bug or a feature depending on how you  look at it :).   Great!  Where can I buy it?  Another note: If \\\"Clipper\\\" increases the incentive to bring stronger  encryption to the mass market, all the better.  It's far overpriced at  the moment.   I don't care where we *need* to get it from, I care where we *can* get it  from, and whether it will interoperate with everyone else.    You can build them right now as long as you don't want to export (a  restriction I firmly oppose).

No more than I would expect, however. -- \",\" I agree with this assessment.  Furthermore, its promotion as providing greater protection than bare voice is quite true, as far as it goes.  However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal of letting LE wiretap \\\"terrorists and drug dealers\\\" is to restrict stronger techniques.    Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption, weak encryption, or (the vast majority) no encryption.  The latter two classes can be tapped.  With weak encryption in every phone, the no-encryption class is merged into the weak-encryption class.  Will the introduction of Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strong privacy to give up on it?  that is, to rely for privacy on a system expressly designed to deny it to people like them?  I doubt it.  The mere introduction of this scheme will give the government *nothing*.  The stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretapping capabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domestic cryptography, and only by this restriction.  \\\"Clipper\\\" appears to be no more than a sop, given to the public to mute any complaints.  We would find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff, but I fear the public at large will not care.  I hate to even mention gun control, but most people seem to think that an `assault weapon' (as the NYT uses the word) is some sort of automatic weapon, .50 caliber maybe.

What they say is opinion, but what they do is what matters, and will continue unless overturned.  And the courts are reluctant to annul law or regulation, going to some length to decide cases on other grounds.  Furthermore, Congress can get away with quite a bit.  They could levy a burdensome tax; this would place enforcement in the hands of the BATF, who as we've seen you really don't want on your case.  They could invoke the Commerce Clause; this seems most likely.  This clause will get you anywhere these days.  The 18th was required because the Supreme Court ruled a prohibitory statute unconstitutional.  In 1970 Congress prohibited many drugs, with a textual nod to the Commerce Clause.  The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 still stands.  I think the government could get away with it. \",\"+ +I love the idea of an inflatable 1-mile long sign....

Biblical teaching expects us to celebrate the resurrection of Christ not once a year but every time someone is baptized.  Col. 2:12-Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.\\\"  Rom. 6:4-Therefore we are buried with him in baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.\\\" Those really want to celebrate the resurrection should by faith walk in newness of life after baptism.  It is not necessary to celebrate a pagan goddess in the process.  Paul answered your question in Romans 9.  In v. 4 he stated that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God, and the promises were given to the Israelites.  It is a package deal.  He goes on to identify those who are true Israelites.  Vs 6-8 makes it plain that the true Israelites are not those who are born that way but those who accept the promise of God.  Paul continued to emphasize that he was an Israelite in 2 Cor. 11:22, then in Gal 3:29 he says that all those who belong to Christ are Abraham's seed, and heirs to all the promises given to the Israelites.  The promises come with the law.  It is all or nothing.  Why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law?  Certainly you would want your husband to be faithful to you.  Or do you believe that adultery is no longer forbidden?  Same law.  BTW  please give a reference for your statement that the Gentiles are only required to observe the basis commandmants.

CAPITAL letters, or NOT, the above is pure nonsense.  It seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities while hoping that Turkey will stay out.

Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes she had, however, is  the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians are attacking Azeri  towns.  Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  going to cause incessant skirmishes.  Think of 10 or 20 years down the  line -- both of the newly independent countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe the other out.  These people will be neighbors, would it not be better to keep the bad blood between them minimal?  If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of their blood and future.  It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.

You see, what one person may see as worthwhile, another may see as worthless.   Again, your form of measurement in this sentence, that being of \\\"worth\\\" is subjective.     When I find that my usage of a word is different than the usage of that word given by another person, I try to find a standard against which to judge that usage. In most cases, the dictionary is the standard I use. Here is a definiton of objective:  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as  distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existance. 3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on observable phenomenon.  By this definition, science does not have an objective worth, since the phrase \\\"objective worth\\\" is an oxymoron. However you asked something a  little differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for a notion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is responsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, and thus \\\"objective\\\") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument. However, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is  \\\"good\\\") is subjective.  I think that the problem here is one of word usage. Take a little time and read the definitions of these words: objective, subjective, worth, value, morality, good, evil. I believe that if you think about the  meaning of them for a while, you will have to conclude that there is no such thing as an objective morality. \",\"I am testing IDEA block cipher implementations for correctness and needs some golden test vectors.

(Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity    since it was coined by Bnai Brith)     What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media,    is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic    Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in    Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.     However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their    homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political    thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the    Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.     As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.     Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true    super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the    Jews used to establish their state : Religion.      Ahmed.  Forget the syntax, Ahmed, and focus on the semnatics. The fact is that the PLO does not recognize Israel's right to exist. This is perfectly obvious from the PLO covenant (Cairo, 1968). The covenant calls for the destruction of the \\\"Zionist entity\\\". As far as I know the Israel-destruction clauses still exist in the document which specifies the purpose for the existence of the PLO. If you would like, I can post the relevant caluses.  Now the Hamas ideal is far more radical, it seems. I know it has been posted here several times, and while I do not have a copy of it, I am sure that someone does and he (or she, of course) would be more than happy to repost it.  Regardless of phrasing, groups like Hamas, and the Hezbollah, and even the newly moderate and politically-correct PLO, have at the very heart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of Israel.

Box 605  Amherst, NY 14226-0605       COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTH-IMPACTING ASTEROIDS      Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula, based on     studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests.         (1/3.4)     D = S  S  c  K  W     : crater diameter in km   g  p  f  n          (1/6)     S = (g /g )      : gravity correction factor for bodies other than      g   e  t        Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g is the surface          e        t          gravity of the target body. This scaling is          cited for lunar craters and may hold true for          other bodies.    (1/3.4)     S = (p / p )     : correction factor for target density p  ,      p   a   t           t          p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U           a          crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average          rock on the continental shields.      C       : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km          in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth).             (1/3.4)     K       : .074 km / (kT TNT equivalent)      n         empirically determined from the Jangle U          nuclear test crater.         3     2         19     W = pi * d * delta * V  / (12 * 4.185 * 10  )        : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent          given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile          density delta in CGS units. delta of around 3          g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid.      An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing     asteroids.      Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor     Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in     diameter.      More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, 1985):      Asteroid     Number of objects  Impact probability  Impact energy     diameter (km)         (impacts/year)    (* 5*10^20 ergs)       10       10       10^-8  10^9       1    1 000       10^-6  10^6       0.1        100 000       10^-4  10^3      assuming simple scaling laws. Note that 5*10^20 ergs = 13 000 tons TNT     equivalent, or the energy released by the Hiroshima A-bomb.      References:      Gehrels, T. 1985 Asteroids and comets. _Physics Today_ 38, 32-41.

The latter was written with     simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind     (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).      More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John     Snyder's USGS publication \\\"Map Projections--A Working Manual\\\", USGS     Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32     projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both     spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a     neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.      You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,     \\\"An Album of Map Projections\\\", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This     contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are     in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.      You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:     Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National     Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and     tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.

The material in John (I'm not sure exactly what is referred to here, but I'll take for granted the similarity to the Matt./Luke \\\"Q\\\" material) IS different; hence, one could have almost any relationship between the two, right up to John getting it straight from Jesus' mouth.   The version of the \\\"usual theory\\\" I have heard has Matthew and Luke independently relying on Mark and \\\"Q\\\".  One would think that if Luke relied on Matthew, we wouldn't have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies, for one thing.   This is the part that is particularly new to me.  If it were possible that you could point me to a reference, I'd be grateful.    Because it closes up the gap between (supposed) writing and the existing copy quit a bit.  The further away from the original, the more copies can be written, and therefore survival becomes more probable.     I'm not really impressed with the \\\"theology\\\" argument.  But I'm really pointing this out as an \\\"if\\\".  And as I pointed out earlier, one cannot make these arguments about I Peter; I see no reason not to accept it as an authentic letter.    The best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants, which is not so bad.   But the statement of divinity is not in that section, and in any case, it's agreed that the most important epistles predate Mark.\",\" Ok, so there are in fact two distinct components transmitted by the chip; the real message encrypted with the \\\"conventional\\\" key, and the serial number and encrypted \\\"conventional\\\" key encrypted with the (IMHO kind of bogus, as the whole concept of \\\"one key that millions of people use which can't be changed\\\" doesn't seem reasonable) \\\"family key\\\".  Suppose I analyze the output of this chip and I'm able to determine which bits are the encrypted packet which contains the serial number and session key.  Suppose I also design a simple algorithm based on this information which takes the data containing the encrypted session key and twiddles a bit (or several) before it's sent down the line.  Mind you, I'm sure the NSA thought of this along with a dozen other attacks I can't imagine, and the system is probably somehow designed so that manipulation of this information will cause a compliant receiving chip to somehow fail to decrypt successfully.  But how? What if the two parties agree in advance on some kind of consistent bit-twiddling scheme, so the decryption chip sees the restored \\\"proper\\\" bitstream but an eavesdropper gets a E[K; UK] packet that's wrong?  I suppose this could be easily defeated if the chip \\\"sends\\\" that information out many times in slightly different ways, making it effectively impossible to be certain you know all the information being sent.\",\"What position does Mike Lansing play?

It's beyond my grasp why some object that Mary, who was far greater than either Enoch or Elijah, should not benefit from the same privelege they recieved.  She was after all, Mother of God, full of grace, and immaculate.   And in St. Germain of Constantinople and St. John of Damascus, and in St. Andrew of Crete, among others.  And it should be noted that the Monophysite Chruches of Egypt and Syria also hold to this belief as part of divine revelation, even though they broke away from the unity of the Chruch in 451 AD by rejecting the Council of Chalcedon.  It might be argued by some Protestants that the Catholics and Orthodox made this belief up, but the Monophysites, put a big hole in that notion, as they also hold the belief, and they split from the Chruch before the belief was first annunciated in writing (as far as is known, much has been lost from the time of the Fathers).\",\" [...Dr. England's story deleted, it was a nice read the first time  through...]]    It isn't so much a matter of 'interpretation' of Bible texts  that sets Mormonism apart from orthodoxy as it is a matter of  *fabrication*.   About 20 years ago, _National Lampoon_ had some comic strips  in them that were drawn by Neal Adams. They were called \\\"Son o' God\\\" comics.  It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible. In the comic, there were a  group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn, and when one of them said  the magic word, he turned into \\\"Son o' God.\\\" He went from a myopic,  curly headed, yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied  portraits of Jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile  features.    Now, if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus,  and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this  NatLamp Jesus, we would have to say that this was fallacious since  this Jesus was a fabrication, and did not really exist.   This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim  that they are Christian. They profess faith in Jesus, but the Jesus  that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the  NatLamp Jesus was. \",\"Please unsubscribe pancamo@blkbox.com.

Cramer is now claiming that pedophilia is a sexual orientation rather than a chronicly homosexual condition.  This changes the whole argument in as much that is pedophilia is a sexual orientation all of its own peds cannot be called homosexual.

Additionally, it is hard to say what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say how long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids for months before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are  every other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start. Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start azathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics about options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of  disease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it is worth.

Anyway...)   The basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption of Mary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles  and all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were present when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days later, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was still unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There was no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed that Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their   preaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently  considered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the apostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of the assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.\",\"For Sale...:           Three software packages for IBM PC and compatible computers:                     o Wing Commander deluxe edition                 o Includes Secret Missions 1 & 2                 o Includes all original packaging, manuals                   and disks                 o Includes registration card (so you can                   send it in and register it in your name)                 o Original price for Wing Commander: $69.95                 o Original price for Secret Missions I: $29.95                 o Original price for Secret Missions II: $29.95                 o Total original price: $129.85                 o My asking price for all these of these                   games TOGETHER is $65.00                 o Wing Commander and the Secret Missions is a                   battle and flight simulator set in space.

I've been working reduced hours the past couple of weeks because I had a son born (the day after Umar's article was posted, btw).  I did respond within a couple of days, but it turns out that a a coincidental news software rearrangement caused postings from this site to silently disappear rather than going out into the world.  This is a revision of that original response.   [this was in response to the claim that \\\"Rushdie made false statements about the life of Mohammed\\\", with the disclaimer \\\"(fiction, I know, but where is the line between fact and fiction?) - I stand by this distinction between fiction and \\\"false statements\\\"]   I had not seen that claim, or I might have been less sweeping.  You have made what I consider factual misstatements about events in the book, which I have raised in the past, in the \\\"ISLAM: a clearer view\\\" thread as well as the root of the \\\"Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW]\\\" thread.  My statement was not that you had not read the book, but that you had not convinced me that you [inter alia] had.  As I said before, if you want to defend your position, then produce evidence, and respond to the evidence I have posted; so far you have not.  Of course, my statement was not directly aimed at you, but broadly at a number of Muslim posters who have repeated propaganda about the book, indicating that they haven't read it, and narrowly at Gregg Jaeger, who subsequently admitted that he hadn't in fact read the book, vindicating my skepticism in at least that one case.  So far, the only things I have to go on regarding your own case are a) the statements you made concerning the book in the \\\"a clearer view\\\" posting, which I have challenged (not interpretation, but statements of fact, for instance \\\"Rushdie depicts the women of the most respected family in all of Islam as whores\\\"), and b) your claim (which I had not seen before this) that you have indeed read it cover to cover.  I am willing to try to resolve this down to a disagreement on critical interpretation, but you'll have to support your end, by responding to my criticism.  I have no doubt as to the ability of a particular Muslim to go through this book with a highlighter finding passages to take personal offense at, but you have upheld the view that \\\"TSV *is* intended as an attack on Islam and upon Muslims\\\".  This view must be defended by more than mere assertion, if you want anyone to take it seriously.   And I appreciate it, but welcome to the club.  I am defending my honest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated (or otherwise) insulting attack on Islam, and the parallel opinion that most of the criticism of the book I have seen is baseless propaganda.  I have supported my statements and critical interpretationa with in-context quotes from the book and Rushdie's essays, which is more than my correspondents have done.  Of course, you are more than welcome to do so.\",\" The 68070 is a variation of the 68010 that was done a few years ago by the European partners of Motorola.

The athiest's position is that there is no PROOF of the existence of God.  As much as some people accept their Church, their priests or straight from their own scriptures as the \\\"proof\\\", this does not  satisfy atheists.  Atheists DO believe in recognisable authorities.  If they were as dogmatic as you claim they are, they would be trying to prove 1 + 1 =2 every time they got up.  What they dispute is that Churches, priests, scriptures etc. represent true authorities and know the TRUTH.   Are you asking us to believe blindly?

[Apologies if I'm answering something already answered in the FAQ. Our news feed has been losing a lot of articles lately - so I haven't seen the FAQ lately to check.]   Two ways:    1) When you start the xterm, you can use command line options:          -n ICON_NAME           To set the icon label          -T WINDOW_TITLE        To set the window title          -title WINDOW_TITLE    Equivalent to -T WINDOW_TITLE   2) You can use escape sequences to change things on the fly:      The basic escape sequence is:  ESC ] <P> ; <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> BEL      where ESC and BEL are the ASCII ESCAPE and BELL characters,     <P> is an ASCII decimal digit -- '2', '1', or '0', depending     on whether you are trying to set the window or icon title,     or both, and <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> is your desired label string.      Hence, this command will set the window & icon title:          echo \\\"\\\\033]0;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\\\\007\\\\c\\\"       To set just the icon title:          echo \\\"\\\\033]1;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\\\\007\\\\c\\\"       To set just the window title:          echo \\\"\\\\033]2;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\\\\007\\\\c\\\"       Of course, you may have to fiddle with exact syntax,     depending on how the echo command works on your system     and what shell you are using (I've shown System-V semantics     under Bourne or Korn shells).      [Hint for Sun OS users:  use /usr/5bin/echo instead of     /bin/echo or Csh's built-in echo.  Otherwise you'll have     to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string     instead of using convenient octal sequences.]      If you want your titlebar updated continously, say to show     your current directory, hostname, or somesuch, then you'll     have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out     the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands.

This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since, as you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.  Another way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you lose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter to replace the lost power.  The problem here is the switchover time and you've got to resync the AC in no time flat.  Unfortunately, most everything is built around the assumption that AC is available, so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to be usable...ya sorta have to make it work with what there already.

DS>        I must have missed the article on the Spagthorpe Viking.  Was DS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front DS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?  No. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when (forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing. The first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max Friz's famous design, but with an overhead \\\"point cam\\\" (see below for more on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground clearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so that the ground clearance was substantially increased:         ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)                  Viking motor (front) ->   \\\\=@=/  This is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved around a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn in the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting rods to accomodate the stroke.  The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still unique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and and extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was required to drive both overhead valves.  Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a pressurized stream of oil to power the \\\"waterwheel\\\" which kept the lobe spinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal engineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to normal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random, resulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the beast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to pressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however, uses an electric oil pump. Wimps).  Despite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This was feasible because it was a racing engine.  With just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers because of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an almost perfect point:                      /\\\\                    /()\\\\   <-lobe                   / XX \\\\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to  valvestems ->   / \\\\  / \\\\    complexity)                 |  |   | |                 |  |===| |                     =0=  <---piston                      |                              Note that the tip was not truly vertical                              (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the                              ground, and this drawing doesn't show the                              curvature because there was none in the                              head itself. The bore curve would start                              about where the cylinder bore disappears in                              this diagram   The effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of the day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of finned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the name.  The Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it worked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary technology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that racing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines were raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate (approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two Springers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and down that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern record of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle historians discount this story.

Since this word both formally and commonly refers to positive/joyous events, your misuse of it here is rather unsettling.    I certainly abhor those Israeli policies and attitudes that are abusive towards the Palestinians/Gazans. Given that, however, there  *is no comparison* between the reality of the Warsaw Ghetto and in  Gaza.    Just as international law recognizes the right of the occupying  entity to maintain order, especially in the face of elements that are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil structure.  Ironically, international law recognizes each of these focusses (that of the occupied and the occupier) even though they are  inherently in conflict.  Israel certainly cannot, and should not, continue its present policies towards Gazan residents. There is, however, a third  alternative- the creation and implementation of a jewish \\\"dhimmi\\\" system with Gazans/Palestinians as benignly \\\"protected\\\" citizens. Would you find THAT as acceptable in that form as you do with regard to Islam's policies towards its minorities?    It is a race, then?

I finally can get hold of the previous owner of the car and got all maintanence history of the car.  In between '91 and '92, the instrument pannel  of the car has been replaced and the odometer also has been reset to zero.  Therefore, the true meter reading is the reading before replacement plus current mileage.  That shows 35000 mile difference comparing to the mileage on the odometer disclosure from.

But to suggest that a *disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is  taking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth disease for lying, would any of us have mouths left?  What if we developed blindness every time we lusted after someone or something?  I dare say all of us would be walking into walls.  Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real* careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for  sin.  The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the result of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was blind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any other STD is a *punishment\\\" for sexual sin, what do we do with  diseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as debilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a specific behavior or lifestyle?  Atonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark about as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin. The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central message of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins, and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of our sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for our sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He has graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or  some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting on the sacrifice that Jesus made.  In case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ, no more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think it's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus healed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on this earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS. She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed  relationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be, but God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining weight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes her improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It seems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.  Paul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I  think applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I (or something like that).  May we all experience and accept God's grace.   =============================================================================== Paul Conditt  Internet: conditt@titan.tsd.arlut.utexas.edu Applied Research Phone:   (512) 835-3422   FAX: (512) 835-3416/3259   Laboratories  Fedex:   10000 Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758-4423 University of Texas Postal:   P.O.

The article starts with \\\"A leader of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible.\\\" O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research \\\"is a real question for me.\\\" O'Connor said \\\"everything is fair game,\\\" including \\\"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry, chopping management of the space station program at some NASA facilities around the country, working closely with the Russian space station Mir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the manned space shuttle fleet.\\\"  O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost.  The Post says O'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I listened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connor talked about how the White House wants three options, sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC, modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch Core [\\\"wingless Orbiter\\\"] @ JSC. Later, in response to a reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a \\\"moderate\\\" cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not the \\\"high cost\\\" option as Sawyer wrote).  The article goes on to describe the other two options as \\\"one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure.\\\"\",\": Help: I am running some sample problems from O'Reilly volume 4, : Xt Intrisics Programming Manual, chapter 3. popup : dialog boxes and so on. :  : In example 3.5, page 76 : \\\"Creating a pop-up dialog box\\\" :  : The application creates window with a button \\\"Quit\\\" and \\\"Press me\\\". : The button \\\"Press me\\\" pops up a dialog box.

Cheers, Kent\",\"[...}  Living through those days at the age of 20 and following the internal and external news gives me that knowledge and position.  In 1974, Turkey had a democratic goverment and free press at that time.  Forget about internal news agencies, I haven't heard anything from any international source about any concentration camps with Greek Cypriot prisoners in Turkey. However, I heard Adana POW camp.  It was not secret and well  recognized POW camp.    I see,  They vanished in Turkish labor camps.  Turks have decided to acknowledge their existence first but later changed their minds releasing them.  Is that it?  What do you think happened to them?  I thought that MIA's are only the subject  of Rambo and Chuck Noris movies.  Seems that I am wrong.   You don't need to belive me.  Turkiye was never a clandestine state in its history,  It has been a respected and continuous member of UN  since the inception of UN.  No body ever questioned the UN membership of Turkey because of what had happened in 1974a and after.  Only a short  lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by USA to satisfy the  internal Greek loby.  I know what you would say next.  Let me answer it before wasting anytime.  Yes!  UN had a few condemning resolutions  against Turkey because of handling the Cyprus problem, especially after the 1980 coup.  Well, US and Israel had a few too.  What can I say? I am sure during Athens Junta duruing 1960-74, Greeks had their own share too.   Have you looked at the latest UN agenda for Cyprus talks mediated by Gali?  There was no issue whatsoever about any missing people among the negotiating parties.  was there? I heard many times from Denktas interviews by Turkish and International press.  He keeps saying that \\\"This was no longer an issue for peace talks.\\\"  Also, you don't want me fish for the Greek Cypriot politician's words (that Argic had posted zillion times) describing missing peoples as  a Greek-Cypriot myth.  Seems that there is a different opinions  among Greek-Cypriots as well about missing people in Turkish  custody.  [..]   I am not claiming anything.  I just told you what was given to Greek Cypriots as an answer by Turkish Goverment/Turkish Cypriots when they wanted to locate some of their own between July 15 and the final cease-fire in late August, 1974.  This answer seems to satisfy the international  community, the UN, and the Vasilu Goverment (since he did not make it an issue for the peace talks).  Also, I am not aware of any UN condemnation against Turkey about any missing Greek-Cypriot.  Are you?    BTW, do you mean that Nicos Sampson had a bloodless coup d'eta and nobody got hurt in those events?     Like I said before.  There is even a different opinion among Greek-Cypriots for this myth.   The officers in Turkish Army who governed the Adana POW camp must be hell of clever dudes to cover up their tracks 8-).  I hope Turkish Army does't have  same type of morons for the security of Turkiye.  However, this must  a good subject for a movie script.

Well, being a Jet fan, I sometimes wish that Bure would get knocked silly too.  (Nothing serious, just enough to keep him out of a game. :)    In most cases, the owners have very little to do with it.  They give their general managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best players so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player is in Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him to be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.  Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian players.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners can do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable here in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US that the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their import ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.  Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would make players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the lower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some that play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm club, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on the secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian players in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.)) So with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players in North America.   I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the world.  I've grown up with Europeans playing on 'my' team, and some of those players were the among the best in the world.

Or: Get an 8-bit DA-Converter (merely a couple of transistors and Resistors) and an OpAmp to compare its output to the voltage you want to measure, connect them to a spared printer port (if you have one), and do the rest by software (stepwise refinement). The port addresses for your printer ports are probably: &H378 (LPT1), &H278 (LPT2). This should work well enough for your purposes.

Let's check Mr. Cain's facts a bit, shall we?    FACT:  It is unlawful to distribute code implementing RSA without a license to do so from PKP, whether or not one is charging for it.  Furthermore, any use of RSA, other than for research purposes allowed under US patent law, is similarly unlawful.  Therefore, the \\\"average citizen\\\" cannot use RSA to encrypt message traffic in the US without a license from PKP.  There is no licensed, freely available product in the US that uses RSA encryption other than RSAREF (and hence RIPEM), at least as far as I am aware.  If you know of another, please post it here.   FACT:  The last contact I had with RSA Data Security, Inc was with some guy trying to sell me a license (unsolicited, I might add) for TIPEM. Cost: $15K plus 2-5 percent royalties.  I suppose it is a matter of opinion as to whether or not these terms count as \\\"mucho bucks\\\" or \\\"incredibly reasonable.\\\"  Either way, however, this definitely falls into the \\\"routines *they* tell you to (use)\\\".   FACT:  There are no restrictions (yet!) on the use of cryptography under US law, although this is beginning to look like it will change.  The only impediments to widespread use of RSA cryptography in the US are PKP's patents.

He was a murderer from the            beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in            him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a            liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)            And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of            the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease            to pervert the right ways of the Lord?

(1 John 3:10)       One becomes a child of God...            But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the           sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)            Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that           we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us           not, because it knew him not.  Beloved, now are we the sons of God,           and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when           he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he           is.

For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;           but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,           Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we           are the children of God: (Romans 8:14-16)            Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one           that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.

We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not       even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that       have differing views is self-defeating.

The only exception is probably herbalism, because scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants and are always interested in seeing if they can find new plants that have active and useful substances.  But that isn't what  is meant by alternative medicine, usually.  If you get into the Qi, accupuntunce charts, etc, you are now back to silly theories that probably have nothing to do with why accupuncture works in some cases.  Perhaps another reason they are reluctant is the Rhine experience. Rhine was a scientist who wanted to investigate the paranormal and his lab was filled with so much chacanery and fakery that  people don't want to be associated with that sort of thing.   --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\"Hi Xian Netters,  God bless you  CONTENTS 1. intro 2. love your neighbor 3. reaction to posts    a. purpose    b. eternal life  I've been reading this news group religiously =) for about a month.

INCREDIBLY CHOPPED UP POST I won't even try to tell you where the deletions came out    I find that I am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can manufacture for ourselves.  Little in the cosmic sense.  Even the greatest of the great pharos are long gone, the pyramids historical oddities being worn down by the wind, eventually to be turned into dust. Mankind itself will one day perish.  Without some interconnectedness that transcends the physical, without God, it is all pointless in the end.  Most people are able to live with that, and for them little purposes (success, money, power, effecting change, helping others) suffice.  I suppose they never  think about the cosmic scale, or are at least able to put it out of their minds.  To me, it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion.  That the true reality underneath the the physical is spirit.  That this world is a school of sorts, where we learn and grow, and our souls mature.  That gives a purpose to my little purposes, and takes some of the pressure off.  It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms if you're really just here to learn.  It's more important to progress, grow, persist, to learn to love yourself and others and to express your love, especially when it's dificult to do so.  Honest effort is rewarded by God, he knows our limitations.    Interesting theological question.  I have a feeling that most common perception of eternal life is WAY off base.

You're not stupid.  Smartdrive caches things, and Windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also.  All of this is pretty risky stuff in a PC environment.   A reasonably accurate prediction...   Here's a brief description of how DOS stores files:  There are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain, and the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.  The directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size, and first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not important right now.  The File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find the actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the number is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it holds a \\\"magic\\\" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad (unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file.  The data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored. The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is doled out in \\\"chunks\\\" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster is 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.  To read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster. Next, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file. Naturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump around and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a time, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker which says it's the last cluster in the file.  CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into submission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to double-check anything it \\\"fixes\\\".  Now let's do a bit of a post-mortem:   All of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match the size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter the directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the directory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long. But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers, obviously, are made up.))   Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached to any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these \\\"lost chains\\\" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK through FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply be marked \\\"available\\\" in the FAT.    ...   These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously, one of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that C:\\\\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...  To fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name. This will \\\"fix\\\" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces. Now delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to assemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  \\\"Missing pieces\\\" are likely to be found in those \\\"lost chains\\\" at the top...)   Your disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of the problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space...  In any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT. There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage after something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the problem occurs.  Sorry.   --  ---------------------------------------------------- Gordon S.

JPEG (pronounced \\\"jay-peg\\\") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of \\\"natural\\\", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is \\\"lossy\\\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of \\\"realistic\\\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File    Size in bytes  Comments  ship.ppm 1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits     or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z  963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress     compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.     Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif  240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif     Most of the savings is the result of losing color     info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95  155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)     This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,     at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75   58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)     You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this     from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50   38406  cjpeg -Q 50     This has slight defects; if you know what to look     for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing     the original.  Still as good image quality as many     recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25   25192  cjpeg -Q 25     JPEG's characteristic \\\"blockiness\\\" becomes apparent     at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).     Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were     of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o    6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)     Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or     indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:     the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good \\\"quality\\\" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  \\\"Quality 95\\\" does NOT mean \\\"keep 95% of the information\\\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \\\"op art\\\".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just \\\"high\\\"/\\\"medium\\\"/\\\"low\\\"-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \\\"How to find sources\\\". (If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with \\\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\\\" in the body.  The \\\"Anonymous FTP List FAQ\\\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for \\\"canned\\\" software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  John Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu or ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the version number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on export or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits internally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to convert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first. But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG. CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check the \\\"save at normal size\\\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it's functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) \\\"msdos/graphics\\\" at Simtel20, that really means \\\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\\\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) \\\"/pub/msdos/graphics\\\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip     Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip     PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \\\"AugJPEG\\\", \\\"NewAmyJPEG\\\", \\\"VJPEG\\\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris, but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The \\\"official\\\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article \\\"How to find sources\\\", referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \\\"JFIF\\\" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called \\\"color quantization\\\".  (This is something of a misnomer, \\\"color selection\\\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \\\"smeared\\\" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as \\\"256-color JPEG\\\".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit \\\"hi-color\\\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying \\\"-Q 100\\\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say \\\"-sample 1x1\\\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to \\\"do their own thing\\\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \\\"low-end\\\" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a \\\"high-end\\\" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \\\"lowest common denominator\\\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     \\\"raw JPEG\\\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it's worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is   \\\"begin\\\" line  M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with   \\\"begin\\\" line  M:'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different \\\"back end\\\" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The \\\"fair use\\\" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (\\\"ghost\\\" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \\\"dithered\\\" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to \\\"smooth\\\" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try \\\"-smooth 10\\\" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that \\\"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\\\" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net. \",\"   I would hope that if you intend to have a reasonable discussion you might wait until I express an opinion before deciding I should be flamed for it. As for 'war' I am not sure how I would define it. If you just look at attacks on villages then there is no way of deciding when it started. Would you count the riots in the 20's and 30's? Violence but not war. I personally think that 'war', as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever, requires organisation, planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces. Perhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts. I could easily be convinced it was so. From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone organisation. The Haganah and Palmach certainly did. That is not a cause for criticism, it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the 'Zionist' camp.   Now you are being silly aren't you? In any case the war did NOT start with the invasion of the Arab Armies. You see we both agree on something. And the previous posters were wrong, no?   Again I am not sure, I doubt you want my opinion anyway, but I think war requires organisation as I said before. It needs a group to command and plan. If Fatah lauches rockets from Southern Lebanon (and are you sure you have the right group - not the Moslems again?) then that sounds like war to me. Stone throwing does not.

When the Jewish National Fund bought most of its land, It didn't buy it from the Palestinians themselves, because, for the most part, they were tenant farmers (fallahin), living on land owned by wealthy Arabs in Syria and Lebanon. The JNF offered a premium deal, so the owners took advantage of it.   It's called commerce.  The owners, however, made no  provisions for those who had worked for them, basically shafting  them by selling the land right out from under them. They are to blame, not the Jews.  \",\" Are you sure you aren't being watched?  Let me remind you that  Watergate was only the tip of the iceberg.

Just as a penny saved is a penny earned.  Enough with the cliches. My point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up to their potential, they won't need much offensive support. I realize this is a BIG IF.  This staff leaves the '92 BoSox in the dust. There is no legitimate comparison.  Two Cy Young winners, and three other pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first or second starter.  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the mound, the other teams score less runs.  The team that scores the most  runs wins.  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage (providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs).  A low  scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves.  They should have many  low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting. On the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players, I would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers. They would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their opponent.  The name of the games is to win.  Even Ray Knight knows that you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard. All I'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers like the Braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong. \",\"We are getting a memory fault and a core dump whenever we end a Motif session under Ultrix 4.3, running on a DEC 5000/240.

Teel:   Well, the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the  Income Tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures for  stopping withholding, et cetera have been out there for a  while now.  Humbug.  Those letters don't provide \\\"concrete proof\\\" of anything at all in the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu- ally work for ordinary people in everyday situations.  Specifically, show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that income tax is illegal and/or that ordinary working types do not have to pay income tax (and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with- out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness).  This issue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expect something squarely on point from the US Supreme Court (in the case of federal tax) or a state's supreme court (for a state's income tax).  Unless you can do that, I for one am unwilling to call your material \\\"concrete proof\\\".   There has been no refutation to date.  Have the nay-sayers  finally given up as defeated?

And the cases you've cited involve such strange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are applicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appeal to the Supreme Court.  Why can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regular employee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay his income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva- sion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court with a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally voluntary?

With all due respect, you can conclude anything you want.

For that matter, I confess I'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you would be looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since I thought you told us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with big banking interests since the 1938 \\\"admiralty jurisdiction\\\" coverup thing. Do you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the trouble to subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back into their burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right combination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo?  Not only that, but why do you even =care= what the US courts say anyway? Didn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by US officials to classify you as a \\\"14th Amendment federal citizen\\\"?  When the FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tell them they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington, D.C., where they belong?  Or maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which you suggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like. If you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can just declare you an outlaw, OK?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roads with no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your wallet can just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (with plenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207).

In these cases some physicians will \\\"tape\\\" the  patient (put a lot of heavy adhesive tape around the chest), or prescribe an elastic binder. All this does is make it harder to breath, but the patient doesn't feel cheated, because soemthing is being done about the problem. Either way, the end results are the same.  ==================================\",\"As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous question \\\"WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD?\\\" I must assume that my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was.  She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she  believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.   (Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the  food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit forming) ?  This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, are: Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pet food to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put in  pet food?  ----------------------------------- I speak for myself and not Motorola -----------------------------------  \",\"Hello all,  I'd like to know, how z-modem-upload is initiated in a WinQVT-Script-file, to check how it works before registering.

The primary reason, and the essence of the details that you are seeking, is that the Grahm-Rudman budget controls were working.  In fact, they were working so well that unless the feds did something, they were going to have to start cutting pork. So Bush and the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replaced Grahm-Rudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush \\\"consented\\\" to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending increases.  As it turned out, the taxes killed the Reagan expansion and the caps on spending increases were dispelled by Clinton in his first act as President (so that he could create his own new plan with more tax increases).  The result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level  ABOVE where it was when Reagan left office.\",\"  Jesus also recognized other holy days, like the Passover.  Acts 15 says  that no more should be layed on the Gentiles than that which is necessary. The sabbath is not in the list, nor do any of the epistles instruct people to keep the 7th day, while Christians were living among people who did not keep the 7th day.  It looks like that would have been a problem.  Instead, we have Scriptures telling us that all days can be esteemed alike (Romans 14:5) and that no man should judge us in regard to what kind of food we eat, Jewish holy days we keep, or _in regard to the sabbath. (Col. 2.)   I don't think that the Sabbath, or any other command of the law is totally irrelevant to modern Christians, but what about Collosions 2, where it says that we are not to be judged in regard to the keeping of the sabbath?\",\" Oh?

A new release of the DIRT interface builder by Richard Hesketh works  with X11R5 and includes some support for the Motif widget set. From the README:   This builder allows the interactive creation and rapid prototyping of X user   interfaces using the X Toolkit and a number of Widget Sets.  Dirt generates   \\\"Wc - Widget Creation\\\" resource files and this distribution also includes the   Widget Creation Library (version 1.06, with the exception of the demos and   Mri/Ari source code) with the kind permission of its author David E. Smyth. Check dirt.README, dirt.A2.0.tar.Z, and dirt.PS.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.   The InterViews 3.0.1 C++ toolkit contains a WYSIWIG interface builder  called ibuild. ibuild generates code for an InterViews application complete  with Imakefile and an X-resource file. Documentation is /pub/papers/ibuild.ps  on interviews.stanford.edu (36.22.0.175).  Quest Windows's (408-496-1900) ObjectViews C++ package includes an interactive building tool.    Druid (Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development) runs on SPARC  machines using OSF/Motif 1.0; it is intended eventually to be a full UIMS but  apparently now has only support for creating the presentation components, for  which it generates C/UIL code.

I want to have a shell script pop up menus and yes/no dialog boxes if the user  is running X.   Several tools in the R3 contrib/ area were developed to satisfy these needs: yorn pops up a yes/no box, xmessage displays a string, etc. There are several versions of these tools; few, if any, have made it to the R4 contrib/  area, though they may still be available on various archive sites.  In addition, Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) has posted the xmenu package to comp.sources.x (\\\"v08i008: xmenu\\\") for 1-of-n choices.  [7/90]  Two versions of XPrompt have been posted to comp.sources.x, the latter being an unauthorized rewrite. [R.

However, the best source of general information on  building the X11 release is found in the Release Notes.

In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts with the way X11R4 builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols to be undefined when building some X11 clients:   _get_wmShellWidgetClass  _get_applicationShellWidgetClass Compiling \\\"-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic\\\" appears to work.   To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), please  contact your local Sun office and request the following patches:  Patch i.d.

I used gcc to compile the whole distribution, but I get several segmentation faults when running X.   Note first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in any performance increase; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the 680x0 or VAX platforms.   Here is the problem: gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing  structures as arguments and returning them as function values, so when  gcc-compiled parts of X are linked with Sun-supplied functions that pass or  return structs, run-time errors occur.  Affected programs include rgb and  the server.   This is from the GCC manual:   On the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for   structures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument  list, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by   reference.   This really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet  supported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.   The convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and  `-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.  You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with  compilation flags.     Files which need to be compiled using cc include:   server/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c    rgb/rgb.c   In addition, several of the \\\"inet_\\\" functions use structs as args or return values:     clients/xhost/xhost.c    clients/xauth/gethost.c.  Calls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly  harmless as they don't involve structs.

When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error   \\\"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket.   Fatal server bug! no screens found.\\\"   Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do  this simple test:   #include <sys/ioctl.h>  SIOCGIFCONF  Run that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of  interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like  whitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your  fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc sources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are  identical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make  sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.

In mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c, we have found \\\"missing\\\" defines for  CG3AC_MONOLEN, CG3BC_MONOLEN, CG3AC_ENBLEN, CG3BC_ENBLEN. What should these be?   The R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add these lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile:         #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)         #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN         #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN         #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN   However, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so  references to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the  Imakefile.  [11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 100)  What are these problems compiling the X server on SunOS 4.1.1? The file <sundev/cg6reg.h> isn't being found.   Sun omitted <sundev/cg6reg.h> from SunOS 4.1.1. Remove the #include  from sunCG6C.c and replace it with the line   #define CG6_VADDR_COLOR   0x70016000 The file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied  from another distribution.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 101)  What are these problems using R4 shared libraries on SunOS 4? All of the executables that I try to run have the following results:  ld.so: libXmu.so.4: not found or even:  ld.so: call to undefined procedure __GetHostname from 0xf776a96c   If you are building with shared libraries on a Sun, remember that you  need to run \\\"ldconfig\\\" as root after installing the shared libraries (if you've installed X on a file-server, run it on the server's clients, too).  While  building and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid  linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those  distributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have  LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.   If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that  the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or  /usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked  statically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]  Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it attempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed. You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to most C compilers).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)  This is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in  X11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was  removed in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5 libraries only applied to the documented interface).    A workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4 or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.

There is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload) running under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using  shared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:  1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system administrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used by these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security  problems at your site.  2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).  3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths to the libraries.  [from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]  The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid program from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this  may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks.  Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?   On many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits  anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by  accessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps more annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console  display. Check the man page for fbtab(5).

Imake is not a replacement for the make program; instead, it is a makefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro- processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles  suitable for building software on a particular system. Although it is not  specific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the  configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.  Imake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by which the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration files, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not  obvious.  There have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and R5 versions are different.   You can obtain information on imake from these sources:  - the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on using Imake to build X  - the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information  - on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4 guide to imake.  - the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim Fulton on an early version of Imake  - Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful  explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non- supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu in the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and  config-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby.  [7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email; mail a message body of \\\"send imake-stuff help\\\" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.  - see \\\"System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?\\\" by Dinah McNutt in the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.  - German readers should expect in June 1992 an article \\\"Das Meta-Make  / I make, you make / Schwerelos\\\" by Rainer Klute in \\\"iX  Multiuser-Multitasking-Magazin\\\", directed at application programmers needing to write Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The X Journal, issue 2:1.  - The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article on demystifying Imake.  - Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in  sasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.  [1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 107)  Where can I get imake?   Versions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier  version is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits  redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the  template and configuration files. There are no real standards for such  configuration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the  templates distributed with X11R5.  export contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake without picking up the entire distribution.  A stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in ftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?   If you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run \\\"xmkmf\\\". This is a  script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a  Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make,  which will use that new Makefile to compile the program.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines? When I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:  Undefined:  _XShapeQueryExtension  _XShapeCombineMask   These routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE) which was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular windows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will  only run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many  vendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case  they will display rectangular windows anyway.   In order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library  libXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes will be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do  not despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be  compiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X  libraries.  [from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 110)  What are these problems with \\\"_XtInherit not found\\\" on the Sun? When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the  error \\\"ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit\\\".   What you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to  get Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that  is both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting  _XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby  guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where  XtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally be called.   You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal Xt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere.   1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a  connection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called XtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your  program; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.  2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView  program. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command.    It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically, although this will certainly solve the problem.   [from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be);  11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 111)  Why can't I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X? I have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under  the current version of X, I get this message:  Undefined:  _XtScrollBarSetThumb  _XtTextSetInsertionPoint  _XtTextReplace   There were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition to the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4 release notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but are part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*. [10/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?   The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one window to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the window manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are called \\\"hints\\\" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you can use something like the following:          XWMHints wmhints;         ...         wmhints.flags = InputHint;         wmhints.input = True;         XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)  If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput  resource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have source, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.  Certain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having  this done.    If you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource to your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant.  OpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true  [mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?   You can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case.   For most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so  long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in  which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can  sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may  be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order to give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window  manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing; this surely leads to future compatibility problems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?    There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the  Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development  under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional  development. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive  application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to \\\"test just  this one little thing\\\" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that  puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for quick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4  distributions, and the Xlib \\\"Hello World\\\" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and  R4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4  Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x   by Glenn Widener of Tektronix.  [3/90]   In addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute  showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display  connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?   The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is sensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:  {  Arg args[3];  int i;  int sensitive;  /* oops; wrong data type */  i=0;  XtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;  XtGetValues(widget, args, i );  ...  }  But XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte;  declaring the variable \\\"sensitive\\\" as Boolean works properly. This problem  comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types  Dimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar  problems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you use the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page. [11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?   You're probably trying to use these functions from application code. They should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a  parent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising  functions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use  only by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.  The only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources. Although this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the  widgets' data becoming corrupted.  [The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be  avoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?   Although there are various details of the current implementation of the Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the \\\"new\\\" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves? What should happen to the widget's children?

One thing I can't stand about the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is down!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around, etc.  But for most work, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than using the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do something simple if you are an inexperienced user, but how long is it before your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs at the moment.)  I don't think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in less time IF you are experienced.  All of the above equally applies to windowing systems on UNIX (especially since Unix is at least 500% more powerful than DOS). \",\" I agree with what Darren has to say here, but would like to add a  personal observation.  What I see as arrogance and the problem I have  with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just  Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by objective means.    Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal  sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these  matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them  but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus  anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God. Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud notion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that leads to arrogance.  In my honest (and nonuniversal) opinion. :-)    comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu\",\"A few days back someone posted info on a gopher site where you could search for medical graphics, etc.  Could someone please repost or mail me a copy?

This is a second RFD, replacing the one originally posted in January '93 (and never taken to a vote).  The proposed groups are described below:  NAME:   comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup STATUS:  Unmoderated. PURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about   system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.  NAME:  comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc STATUS:  Unmoderated. PURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,   including issues such as security, networking features, console   mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.  RATIONALE:  Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family  of operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish  to argue about the meaning of an \\\"OS\\\").  The family ranges from  Modular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to  Windows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over  50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the  actual release is slated for May/June '93.   While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares  an application programming interface with the other members of the  Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-  dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking  and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for  Windows 3.1.   The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows  3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses  Program Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-  sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced  Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and  NT also runs existing 3.1 applications.   Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following  groups with the other members of the Windows family:   comp.os.ms-windows.apps   comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools   comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc   comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32    The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as  well as Windows 3.1:   comp.os.ms-windows.announce   comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy    In conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the  Windows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal  structures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating  systems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have  undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate  newsgroup hierarchies.   Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --  when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-  generation Windows, \\\"Chicago\\\", debuts next year, surely it should  remain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-  tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?   DISCUSSION PERIOD:  The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.    VOTING:  The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on  the feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will  be accepted prior to the CFV.\",\"Archive-name: space/launchers Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:11 $  ORBITAL AND PLANETARY LAUNCH SERVICES  The following data comes from _International Reference Guide to Space Launch Systems_ by Steven J.

Likewise for the San Francisco Chronicle, and I have never seen a gun ad in the San Francisco Examiner.  Specifically, about a year ago on Thursdays, when Traders placed its ads, the Chron. ad would not have any graphics representing any handgun sale, though text could list it.  The Trib. would run a graphic of a handgun.  The Examiner would not have a Traders ad at all.  Over the past year while Oakland politicians have made a lot of noise about measures to fight crime the Trib stopped taking the Traders ad, then started publishing it, but without any handgun graphic, then stopped, then started.  Since the Trib. was sold some months ago it has not had the Traders ad.  During one of these non-ad interludes a Traders employee told me that the Trib. had refused to take their ads.  Yes, the usual Chron. Thursday ad was there today, with graphics representing rifles, safes, etc. as usual.\",\"Facts: ===== - A Netware Server 286A was roughly moved to a new location and left powered down for three months. - From memory it has an 80 MB hard drive. - Manuals and original disks are for SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a - When powered up, the CMOS was wiped. A technician examined it and  pronounced the disk drive unusable.  My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides). When CMOS set this way, COMPSURF runs happily, with 13 bad blocks.  I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive.  Install will proceed \\\"successfully\\\", but when I try to boot the server, it reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware.  Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present, and there is one disk drive (or at least one large single unit).   Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready errors.  Questions: ========= The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware for level II (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes?   So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?  1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this what is causing my serialisation error? 2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, one of which has failed? 3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive? 4. What else can cause a serialisation error? 5. What happens if the keycard fails? 6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments and guides.  Thanks for your time.

(AP) -- A police officer afraid he would be fired for allegedly assaulting a teen-ager walked into an auto body shop wher the youth worked, said \\\"You're going to die\\\" and fatally shot him and two others, police said.  A fourth youth was wounded.  A fifth escaped injury by hiding under a car.  The wounded youth ran about two blocks to a house after the shooting at about midnight Tuesday and called police.  He was hospitalized in satisfactory condition Wednesday.

 This brings up an interesting subject that has not been discussed much, and probably has not been studied much.  As some of you may be aware, I've posted a lot of articles lately on personality typing (of which the MBTI is a test vehicle).  To come up to speed, just read 'alt.psychology.personality' and/or ask for by personality type summary file.  One observation is that people have significantly different personalities (no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respect to church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while other people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more solitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized if confronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of people.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.  My impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and create environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted (there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I am quite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churches to participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very uncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly influenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing. (BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both preferences have their place in the Body).  Maybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words are usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvert scale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following is excerpted from my summary:  1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:          Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside                           world of people, activities or things.          Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal                           world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.   Hopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can structure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise the Body of Christ, instead of trying to change people's personalities to fit them into a particular framework.  I'm sure there are other aspects of how churches have not properly understood personality variances among their members to the detriment of all.  Jon Noring  --   Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.\",\": It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions : prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  A good example of this is Abraham (referred to in the James passage). Hebrews says that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated through his works (i.e., he obeyed what God told him to do).  Reading Abraham's ``biography'' in Genesis is very instructive. He was a man beset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his wife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil God's promise on God's behalf by copulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didn't evaluate him on the basis of individual incidents. Abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of  faith'' in Hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, God declared Abraham as a man of faith. He believed God's promises.  This gives us confidence. Although real faith demonstrates itself through works, God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in performing works.  ``Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit.''

I wouldn't want him to think me a hypocrite for not responding to *every* stupid article on t.r.m.  [dictionary definitions of \\\"not\\\" \\\"disagree\\\" and \\\"agree\\\" deleted]  Oh, but I'm weary of trying to wade through Jim's repertoire of  red herrings and smoke screens.  Let's see what we get when we run all four articles posted by Jim today through the 'discord' filter (a Markov chain program that Steve Lamont was kind enough to send me):   Taking action? A white geese be held  as an accomplice to be held as  a decision upon the door  A black and white goose waddles past  the eyes of the door.   Hits it with the confidence interval for   that individual is held responsible   for that, that individual   may be held as a   getaway car may be held   as an uncountably large number   of the driver of something   and agree.   A black goose   waddles past the person imprisoned?   White goose waddles past the   confidence interval for the population   of geese be axed,   fine.  And white goose   waddles past the door.  Does running Jim's articles through 'discord' make them more coherent?  Less coherent?  Or has 'discord' turned Jim's articles into an angst-ridden poem about making choices in a world filled with uncertainty, yet being held responsible for the choices we make?  Do the geese symbolize an inner frustration with ambiguity, a desire that everything be black and white, with no shades of gray?  Does the \\\"getaway car\\\" tell us that to try to renounce the existential nature of our being is not to \\\"get away\\\" from responsibility for our actions, but rather to take the role of the passive accomplice, the \\\"driver\\\" of the getaway car, as it were?  Does the juxtaposition of man and machine, car and driver, reveal a subtext: an internal conflict between determinism and moral responsibility?

Please contact her directly.      For Sale\",\"  : The issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It : has been whether they fired their main guns.    Never?  This is incorrect.  Either you don't read very well or resort to falsehoods in an attempt to make a point.  At the risk of boring and belaboring the point, my claim was the chain was regarding the tanks \\\"last used in Detroit in 48\\\". The text follows.  :  You did not merely claim that : tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress : sniper fire and that they were \\\"quite\\\" effective at this.    Indeed, when Coffman claimed they were only used as APCs, I did say I had been told they did fire their main guns.     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ : You continue to : back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is : disputing.  Well, the poster who I responded to did dispute the use of tanks post-48.  Rude of you to call Gary Coffman a nobody.    : \\\"Well, it's not the main gun.\\\"  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you : now going to admit that you were wrong?  That was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?    --------------------------------------------------   \\\"I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.\\\"    --------------------------------------------------    I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words, \\\"bullshit filters\\\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.    What was it I claimed as fact?  Here's the entire post:   --------------------------------------------------  Correction.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, it was well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions it in his song \\\"Black Day in July\\\".   --------------------------------------------------    Since you don't dispute that and claim that nobody else does, that means I was right.    : I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67 : riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place : without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American : military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have : been *big* news.     So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48.    Awesley goes on:   You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.  : To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion : grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be : perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since : it makes your other claim seem more plausible.  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.   : If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been : screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about : it.      Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot. Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \\\"several\\\".  I've also heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd assert that I claimed they were truth.  : Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up.      Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks. So it would have been an Army cover-up.     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.  : If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer : to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that : those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.     Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe that they did fire their guns.     Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the account I cited.  : --John L. Scott\",\"Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith                             WEIRD SCIENCE  Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips  move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are  politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase  \\\"political science\\\" is subject to more than one interpretation.    Years ago, we heard how \\\"scientists\\\" were worried that a new Ice  Age might be coming, and later on that \\\"nuclear winter\\\" -- smoke  and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international  unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even  have killed the dinosaurs.    What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this,  that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended  to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken  values that made America the most successful culture in history,  and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague  when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.    We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William  Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't  supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least  100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never  know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit  their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and  that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.    But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of  science as they are of everything, they trust \\\"scientists\\\" to  unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's \\\"scientists\\\"  have agendas of their own.    Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is  going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that  there is no respectable evidence for \\\"global warming\\\".  The money  and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and  they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical  crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.    The same appears true of \\\"acid rain\\\", a deliberate hoax cooked up  by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private  industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and  foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on  specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.    The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.   \\\"Ozone depletion\\\", for which evidence is even more suspect and  contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than  a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era  when state central planning and the command economy have failed and  can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.    Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth  and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear  power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy  known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount  of energy there is available to any individual in society, the  freer that individual -- and his society -- become.    Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and  self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as  ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive  reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have  been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.    And what the media didn't say about recent EPA \\\"discoveries\\\" on the  effect of \\\"secondhand smoking\\\" is that, although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of  magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a  week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether  there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.    That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically  correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice  to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy  practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's  science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is  highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet  the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There  isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of  government money on the scientific establishment.    Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies  to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one  time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and  religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has  tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of  abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street  -- has wound up being shed.    Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's  lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of  livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate,  to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels  for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates,  when they die from the effects of obesity.    What we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two  more centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of  state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable;  real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will  simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and  everyone will benefit.    L.

This is second hand, so I don't know how true it is, but I have no reason to doubt it either.  Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge hockey team.  The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I can't remember his name) either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the Bradley Center.  Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but  turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was too high.  Like I said, I don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but if it's true, don't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon.  The Admirals aren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL club and a minor league club in the same building, especially since the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks play there as well.\",\" I've been a very intent NREN spectator of the NREN for years.  As a  commercial IP software vendor, it really is my professional opinion that the  NREN, at this point, is irrelevant to private sector networking.  If it had  been deployed five years ago, it would have been a major development.  Now, however, it's just an upgrade to the NSFnet, and an attempt to revive the  lagging use of the national supercomputer centers.  You could cut out the  NSFnet completely, and the Internet would continue chugging along without a  hiccup (aside from a few universities).  Long-haul networking and Internet connectivity have long since ceased to be  under federal sponsorship or regulation, at least in the USA.  The success of  the CIX (Commercial Internet Exchange) is a prime example of this.  While our  dear VP has been promoting his \\\"data superhighway,\\\" the private sector has  been building it, without the NSFnet's restrictions.

I inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  I can stick it in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  I'm not fat, just have a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch to get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it still hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and   muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent  irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep,  wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the puncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the  spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot, and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 \\\" apart.)  This is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.

The people of  Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never  abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally  hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole  perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July  15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop  Makarios.  Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with  the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right  given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently  and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For  those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island  since 1571.   The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences  for this irresponsible conduct.               THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM  2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus  It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the 24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum.  AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS  The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed...  The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent, are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.  Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event.  \\\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs. Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain. Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard voices saying, in  Greek, \\\"You want Taksim eh!\\\"  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks, who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.  When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was brutally murdered.  In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying \\\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\\\"  I became terrified. I thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed.  An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who were all wounded.  We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik.  There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter.  After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus, Greeks arrested me at the Airport.  All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my detention. They then released me.\\\"  ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER  We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days.  We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some terrible sights.  In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A child's bicycle lay in a corner.  In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother.  In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head.  This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.  Today was five days later, and still they lay there.

Date : 1 January, 1964.    IL GIARNO (Italy)    THEY ARE TURK-HUNTING, THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM.   Discussions start in London; in Cyprus terror continues. Right now we  are witnessing the exodus of Turks from the villages. Thousands of people  abandoning homes, land, herds; Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless. This   time, the rhetoric of the Hellenes and the bust of Plato do not suffice to   cover up barbaric and ferocious behaviors.   Article by Giorgo Bocca, Correspondent of Il Giorno  Date: 14 January 1964   DAILY HERALD (London)   AN APPALLING SIGHT  And when I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight. Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.  In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16  wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.    DAILY TELEGRAPH (London)    GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE   Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the  Turkish Sector of Nicosia, as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found  crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios, 13 miles away, were  brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three   more bodies, including one of a woman, were discovered nearby but could  not be removed. Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to   locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site.

No, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.  I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I haven't seen IDE drives cheaper.  : The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card : (or PGA?) was $800.

No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read: easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or Mac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.  : I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented : data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better : (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when : managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.  On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:  A (partial?) list:  1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them   concurrently.  2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac  and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice  with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)  3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For  instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor  212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will  work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the  termination, plug it in, and away it goes.  4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that  the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is  quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:  to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very  noticable, as many things can be going on at once.  One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card.    Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.  No mysterious jumpers to figure out.  Greg.\",\"Hi, everybody:     I guess my subject has said it all.  It is getting boring looking at those same old bmp files that came with Windows.

It would have the plus of RocketShare and the minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator, NuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.  Apple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except perhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC slot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC accelerators.  One potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will need a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with Rocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.  Apple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in existing 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreaking prices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seen much cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.  First generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed CPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later. This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled for clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which I doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do this, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as standard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where Apple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup is in order.  By the way, last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC, Pentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessor front for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies. Also, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and all the other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent right now.  Once anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's market position will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially if AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it might). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome battle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while not guaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one of several.\",\"Hi there,  I've made a VGA mode 13h graphics library available via FTP.  I originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone here will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but are missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as an intro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.  *** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it *** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a *** different version.  The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They are fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes, anyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a \\\"virtual screen\\\", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with no transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included a simple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256 color GIF image into a buffer.

I do > not deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions > from evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on > the evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any > possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the > rather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere > is not self explanatory).   So your are saying to rely on our feelings and experiences (since this is the only other source of information left to us). How can you then convince somebody that your \\\"feelings and experiences\\\" are the correct ones then if you can't show somebody visible and measurable effects?  If my experiences say that \\\"there exists no god\\\" and yours says there does, where does that leave us?  Since we are only going on experiences, then both of us are correct within our own personal realities.  Furthermore, the trouble with \\\"feelings and experiences\\\" is that they can lead you astray, as the tragic outcome of Waco illustrates.  I am sure that many of Koresh's followers really believed in him but I think that you and I will agree that they were being misled.  Finally, how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physical sphere is not self-explanatory when you only rely on the five senses?   You must be using a definition of \\\"evidence\\\" that I am not familiar with. To me, evidence is something you can show others -unambiguously- that what you are saying is true.  However, I agree with you that belief in a diety is a matter of faith. It is not something you can share around - others must experience it independantly.  Unfortunately, as I have explained above, this puts belief down to a matter of experience.  My impression is that Christians do not have the monopoly on reason, evidence and faith as far as any of these things can go.   At the risk of repeating my argument : As I have explained previously,  the trouble is that Moslems, Buddhists, Jews, etc will ALL say that THEY claim, with good reason, to be a valid system, possessed of the best evidence, for explaining Gods revelations to man (for Buddhists it should read \\\"for explaining the non-existence of God\\\").  So not only must you \\\"prove\\\" your own case, you have to \\\"disprove\\\" theirs.  (alt.messianic is a good place to see people strong in the belief of their own faiths ... and with their own good reasons)   I know that ALL people can use reason ... I never claimed that they don't. I just wish to make sure that their arguments are well-founded.  It goes without saying that if I make a blunder that I expect people to correct me.  Once we have all gone through this process of removing the  non-essential and contradictory bits, we should (hopefully) have made some progress towards the truth.  \",\"Dear Xperts,  I'm developing an application that uses a Motif slider to select an image file out of a directory.

We were there to discuss SSTO, and commercial space.  This is how it went...    After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO, I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard the gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour. Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.  We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide, who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not bozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to  make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.  Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking to him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening. We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.   Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another woman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that we brought up.  But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate aligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space. So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to LEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming  feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that. We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism paper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog over L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is  more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to  understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education  whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other fields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday  would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.  We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal communicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided in those sectors.  Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc.. We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.  We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order to make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.  We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are proceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the results from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan), and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along the lines of lowering the cost to LEO.  In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data  Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it. He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it, and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually happen immediatly there.  The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they could feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know the answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who really did know the answers.  Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He said that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this would be something that she would be very interested in, although they do have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the state 1 week out of 6 these days.  All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\",\"This is an all-point team for the Canadian NHLers who are not playoff bound...

And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB, because it runs at 8 Mhz and 16 bits. Do people forget that the IDE was specifically designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen IDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all times it was a 16 bit standard, running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When you run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running it at 33 Mhz, it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever, none of them run at CPU speed.  The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to a caching controller. I suspect it would be much, much better to get a software disk cache instead, since you get write-caching as well.

I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we   agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.   When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could   get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he   started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had   miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed   another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was   their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then   brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I   reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be   treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole   deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,   snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by   the turn of events.  Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting   to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and   asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him   that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,   that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs   and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still   pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to   lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told   him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.  A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all   apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus   knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about   it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,   and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....  I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we   decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him   back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the   truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the   incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of   there in my new truck in about 30 mins.  So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not   have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales   person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I   sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their   mistake.

Ville Siren's slap  shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi  scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal  put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.  The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo  made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,  during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.  Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to  Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered  the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund   skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.  Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line  where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since  there was traffic in front, 4-3.  Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \\\"the Shadow\\\" Nilsson. Stefan  and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to  Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.  Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only  21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone   with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja  made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.  The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal  late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,  showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck  and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.  But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the  game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow  angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.   All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.  Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period  to try no combinations.   Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-  Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.  Stillman good on defense.  Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner  hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson  will likely have to leave for NHL pros.   Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the  Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him  a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.  I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-  resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Starting lines:    SWEDEN     FINLAND    35.

As a result, the gay population is not encouraged to develop \\\"non-promiscuous\\\" relationships.  In fact there are many roadblocks put in the way of such committed relationships.

Please stop with the predictions, we all know the Caps are going to win the Cup, so let it go at that. \",\"I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly, (motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only \\\"real solution\\\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both  legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the \\\"internal nerves\\\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd  always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that \\\"force\\\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.  Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\",\"Note:     The following was released by the White House today in           conjunction with the announcement of the Clipper Chip           encryption technology.                             FACT SHEET                    PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT  The President has approved a directive on \\\"Public Encryption Management.\\\"  The directive provides for the following:  Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology.  Encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of communications and data by preventing unauthorized access.  Advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications.  These advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the information age.  Despite its benefits, new communications technology can also frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated encryption can have this effect in the United States.  When exported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence activities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law enforcement and national security interests, while at the same time protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As encryption technology improves, doing so will require new, innovative approaches.  In the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.  To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect and decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted information, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:  INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS  The Attorney General of the United States, or her representative, shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which incorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed key-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from the American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to ensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow microcircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications hardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the security of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the government from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.  KEY-ESCROW  The Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate entities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits installed in communications equipment.  In each case, the key holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent unauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only to government agencies that have established their authority to acquire the content of those communications that have been encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney General shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such communications.  PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES  The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate U.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted with key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems that process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of a final standard within six months of this directive. \",\"Source: \\\"Men Are Like That\\\" by Leonard Ramsden Hartill.

This doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.    Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be, and isn't.     I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement.   First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ  could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the  male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.   Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.   Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism is an attractive option.   I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.) should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\",\" When the Lunar Society's $500M estimate of the cost of a lunar colony was mentioned at Making Orbit, somebody asked Jerry Pournelle \\\"have you talked to Bill Gates?\\\".

Since we apparently don't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing cameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests are going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with the video being piped into a command center they're building somewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers or cheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large multi-colored status displays will show the various routes using different colors to represent the various average speeds for each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front of the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic status to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently also looking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to providing continuous audio from this system.  In the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data on traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the system is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it will be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read \\\"cheap\\\").  We also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP audio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal reports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle receivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is applicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using some other TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your stereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information. I believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle receivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly fees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers don't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely true), they likely have no investment in keeping the system up and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You may have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing more, when this happens.

Like so many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.  I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I deign from commenting much further.   Now hold it.  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as many other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that Christians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily being arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute, but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.    Not quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably* determine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible human beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The  distinction is subtle yet important.  When a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results are reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could have been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken, without sacrificing his convictions.  Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty. Throughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know with complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the right direction when he uttered, \\\"Cogito, ergo sum,\\\" yet we have not advanced much beyond that.  Do you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that the computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely certain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course, you have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all practical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with Christianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about absolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability  that they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do)  abandon these absolutes.   As I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does not mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to  render all doubts unreasonable. \",\"The idea of the card is bull in and of its self, but I'm curious to know, do  they plan on making it a requirement to *always* have it on you, or is it  only going to be required to be *presented* when trying to ge medical aid?

Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question, because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000.  Basically, there are a number of functions with prototypes set up in, let's say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the composite widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type :   typedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget)  but in several places in the HP source code, they reference the insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just one, as the prototype suggests.

(Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing will be discussed at the beginning - Note: I've set all followups to sci.med since most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I'm sure most of the replies, if any, will be med-related.)     They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS). Oops, that is not a recognized \\\"illness\\\" in the psychological community, better not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)  Actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system, just e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general population, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among physicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage - any help here a.p.p.er's?)  One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious choleric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to control, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are also extroverted, they are best described as \\\"Field Marshalls\\\".  This trait is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to lead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge, to raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically- minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However, when the NT person has self-image challenges, the \\\"dark-side\\\" of this personality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.  A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling), and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've known many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them with a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).  Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)  Enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.    You've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being the phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent.    In my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune stressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged. I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the details), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this diagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal therapy below).   The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being considered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween infection.    I was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after my blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then dropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received zinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular specialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal, he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin) supplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene. Call me carrot face.  :^)  Hopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to all supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for example, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had good information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.    Though I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my sinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that demonstrate candida \\\"blooms\\\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation (sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on Sporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered normal).  BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious) aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion.    My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic response to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive. Another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow part-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a  threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post, one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a  Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.  BTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \\\"Sinus Survival\\\", has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic anti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over 90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it doesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection is not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that nystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.  This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit, lots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who has to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.    This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the appropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture the yeast \\\"bloom\\\" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.  It's a real Catch-22.  Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that no studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not up to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which should not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should be done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets, you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get funding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the smaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other doctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get nowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.  It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have *decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable hypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue -  excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will not, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...    Aren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia?    Again, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus species can grow hyphae (\\\"roots\\\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing in bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but you can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has been pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in e-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long- term treatment of GI tract \\\"candidiasis\\\".  It's like trying to weed a garden by cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away.  The $60000 question is whether a contained candida \\\"bloom\\\" can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \\\"systemic\\\" in the classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal.    Also, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a prior post, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)    As I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work. For example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention surgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and fairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and equalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly improved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated. Of course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have improved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to \\\"live with it\\\".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total \\\"cure\\\".  The anti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those having sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above. Be sure to get the revised edition.)    Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his visits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said \\\"you'll just have to live with it\\\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and non-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road to recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti- \\\"yeast hypothesis\\\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as, \\\"it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\\\", to put it mildly. I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient.  Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \\\"hypothetical yeast overgrowth\\\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people have identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues have been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things - you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice? Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with \\\"scientific correctness\\\" that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which we don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach (such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having exhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I went to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment, and as a result I have found significant relief.  Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having his license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt) therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me: \\\"well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority to use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I can't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State Board.\\\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic reasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the patient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine, and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything it can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of which seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all (true quackery).

Jon Noring   --   Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.\",\"From: baba@Tymnet.com (Duane Hentrich) -BTW, I'm a WALC (white aryan lapsed catholic) - --- -d'baba Duane M. Hentrich        baba@Tymnet.Com -    I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich calling himself an Aryan.  The word `Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first in the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda.  It seems to have been a tribal term but may have had connotations of good character.  Such connotations are quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the eightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholar Max Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the Nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is synonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  The people who originally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans and possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the word by Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is nontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claim to call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor- shipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.    If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory's book, ``In search of the Indo-Europeans\\\" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica. The reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and for Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible things done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans have no clear claim.\",\"         While I don't mean to damn Henrik's attempt to be helpful here, he's using a common misconception that should be corrected.

There must be a guarantee of peace before this happens.  It seems that many of these Lebanese youth are unable to restrain themselves from violence, and unable to to realize that their actions prolong Israels stay in South Lebanon.   If the Lebanese army was able to maintain the peace, then Israel would not have to be there.  Until it is, Israel prefers that its soldiers die rather than its children.     Israel should withdraw from Lebanon when a peace treaty is signed.  Not a day before.  Withdraw because of casualties would tell the Lebanese people that all they need to do to push Israel around is kill a few soldiers.  Its not gonna happen.     Why should Israel not demand this while holding the buffer zone?  It seems to me that the better bargaining position is while holding your neighbors land.  If Lebanon were willing to agree to those conditions, Israel would quite probably have left already. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that the Lebanese can disarm the Hizbolah, and maintain the peace.  Adam Adam Shostack            adam@das.harvard.edu\",\" I would recommend \\\"Essential Truthes of the Christian Faith\\\" by RC Sproul. It is copywrited 1992 from Tyndale House Publishers. Sproul offers concise  explanations, in simple language, of around 100 different Christian  doctrines, grouped by subject. I think it would be particularly good for newer Christians (and older Christians suffering spiritual malnutrition), as it gives a Biblically sound basic treatment of the issues, avoiding  long in-depth analysis that can wait until after you know the basics.  \",\" I've got the 6.0 spec (obviously since I quoted it in my last posting).  My gripe about TIFF is that it's far too complicated and nearly infinitely easier to write than to read, which I think hurts your acceptance by anything that will need to read those images (e.g., paint programs).  In a nutshell, I don't think TIFF is salvageable unless the fat is trimmed significantly- and then it wouldn't be TIFF anymore.  They keep trying to cut it back, but it's late now.  Maybe they >will< fix it, and change that magic number to signify the lack of compatibility.  That would probably make me happy.\",\"  And some comments, with some players deleted.   Yep, that Kevin Mitchell.  I never would have expected him in the #1 spot.  It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points higher in both leagues than any other year.  Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.  Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell :->.  The other elite fielders in the league.  This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average. His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  Add another to the elite fielders list.  Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low 1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988 (best year ever) brings his average up a lot.  Strange last two years.  According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base. But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).  Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.  Last year -- a fluke or a portent?  Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?  Brook  is declining.  Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third.  Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about 10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.  Moving back to second was a good idea.  So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.  Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.  Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.  Not a good fielder.  Both are better off at shortstop.  Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to have helped his fielding any.    Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest DA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean. --  Dale J.

Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the   maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the  characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility  in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font  file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters  appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on.  Well, yes, both Type 1 and TrueType fonts can contain lots of characters. And in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to Windows ANSI in Windows, and to Mac standard roman encoding on the Mac.  No difference there between T1 and TT!     And as for fonts with thousands of glyphs, right know these are a liabiliaty rather than a great new thing.  Reason is that a font with 3000 characters is very large, and if you can only access 224 of them you are paying a heavy price in downloading time and printer storage.  (And at the moment there is only one program of that uses `partial font downloading')   For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows  char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font  is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac  char set.    Yes and T1 text fonts all have the `ISO Adobe' character set, which is a superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding.  The question is whether you can get at the glyphs.  In Windows, for example, you cannot get at the ligatures `fi' anfd `fl' (both T1 and TT)even though a font may very well have them.  ANd, while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type 1 font and to create a new Windows metric file (PFM) for it, there are utilities out there to allow you do this.  How do I reencode a TrueType font?  How can I get at the `fi' and `fl' ligatures in Windows (or on the Mac)?  Are there utilities that make it possible to circumvent the hard-wired Windows ANSI encoding?      > Regards,                                            1001-A East Harmony Road    > Bob Niland                                          Suite 503    > Internet:  rjn@csn.org                              Fort Collins CO 80525    > CompuServe: 71044,2124                              (303) 223-5209 \",\"I got the offer to upgrade this weekend.

Yes!  So were their non-Christian contemporaries (the more familiar you are with late Republican Rome or the Pricipate, the weirder those people will seem -- forget the creative filtering done by Renaissance and Eighteenth Century hero worship.)  So are modern non-Christians.  And Christians.  You are pretty weird, yourself, with your rather acid dismissal of Luther and of Protestantism -- and in apparently buying into a simplistic propaganda model about Catholicism *not* being faddish.   Sure, it's so large that global fads take longer cycles than they do in smaller denominations (and local ones are not usually visible unless you do a lot of traveling to exotic lands :-)).  May I recom- mend, as a salutary antidote to this nonsense Philippe Aries' book _The Hour of our Death_, a longitudinal study of death customs in  Western [specifically Catholic] Christendom?  And it won't help to escape into the obscurity of the first Christian century.  Paul was pretty weird, too; as were Peter and the others in the (apparently quite weird) circle around Jesus.  What I think you might find helpful is a bit more charity -- try to understand these weirdos and nutcases with the same respect and love you would expect others to show YOUR notions.  We *are* commanded to love one another, after all.  And Brown's book is, in fact, a heroic attempt to SEE the groupings he talks about as motivated in love and the gospel and their social contexts.  (If anything, Brown is *too* heroic here -- he manages to overstrain himself at times :-))  I don't suggest that we *follow* any of these old cult paths -- and it raises hard questions from the skeptic inside me that so much of early Christianity *was* like the weird (Christian and non-Christian) cults we see today.  To that extent, I think you raise a serious problem (and perhaps your phrasing is implicitly self-deprecatory and ironic.)  But the first principle for *answering* these questions is respect and love for those we do not understand.  And it helps to *work* at under- standing (as long as we do not get overwhelmed by revulsion and begin to withdraw our respect for them as people.)  I would advise, in other words, MORE historical reading (Brown's other books are also good, most especially his bio. of Augustine; also try Robin Lane Fox's _Christians and Pagans_, maybe the Paul Veyne ed. _History of Private Life_, some of Foucault's books on sexuality in the ancient world ...)  Humanity *is* weird -- we have known ONE sane person, and we killed Him. Fortunately for us, this has proved a Comedy rather than a Tragedy.  Easter, 1993.  (yes; this is a tad early -- our Vigil service here has been moved forward because so many churches in the area have taken to doing their own Vigils, and the seminarians must therefore worship-and-run if they are to do it here and there as well.  Think of this as an Anglican fad.  :-))\",\" Well Sweden and Australia, and lord knows wherever else used to drive on the \\\"wrong\\\" side of the road, so the export market might have been larger then than just the UK.   By the 1920s, there was a very active \\\"good roads\\\" movement, which had its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so, and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco \\\"America on the Road\\\" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called \\\"The Devil Wagon in God's Country\\\" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or John Bell Rae's auto histories.  As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I don't know why.   Dan dh3q@andrew.cmu.edu Carnegie Mellon University Applied History\",\"    Try putting one of the IRQs for your COM ports onto IRQ2. The hardware will automagically wrap IRQ2 to IRQ9 on AT class machines (eg, anything with high IRQs). This is what I'm doing on my set up right now.     I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software), COM1 on IRQ3, SoundBlaster on IRQ5, LPT1 on IRQ7, and my ATI BusMouse port on one of the interrupts in between. Works just great.    If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that details how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the higher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.    It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9. This will be the   first IRQ serviced by the system, giving the modem a better response --  especially handy under multitaskers like OS/2 -- which I'm running with no problems.  Justin\",\" My votes (FWIW):  Team MVP: Pat Verbeek. He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has  36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain throughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and Mark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than MVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on the team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.  Biggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season as a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+ points. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming from the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew Cassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and Petrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23 and will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the role of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put up about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing,  although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the right side.  Biggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77 point season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started the season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate, since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it). Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded the powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his way out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left to run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the  Maple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar after signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of competence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better hockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only seemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got to make a number of starts in a row.\",\"David   \",\" I see some irony here.

No current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if you're grounded in some other way at the same time.    The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly  measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.    They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere, repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things like sub-panels.)  What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact, depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.  There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and news.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) and you should probably read it before asking any more questions.  I'll mail a copy to you, append a copy here, and will ask the writers to cross-post it here in the future. \",\"ddavis@cass.ma02.bull.com (Dave Davis)    II. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because    they are not quoted by the NT authors.  That is not quite accurate.  Otherwise we would have the book of Enoch in the canon (as Dave noted).  One can say that the  apocrypha are not quoted by Christ.     III. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because    they teach doctrines contrary to the (uncontroverted)    parts of the canon.     then I answer:     These is a logically invalid *a priori*.     Besides, we are talking about OT texts-     which in many parts are superceded by the NT    (in the Xtian view). Would not this same    principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_?    This principle cannot be consistently applied.   I have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one voice, and he does not contradict himself.    The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decided that the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books such as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example, the Lutheran hymn \\\"Now Thank We All Our God\\\" quotes a passage from this book.  The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church's history.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the Spirit in so doing.

Therefore there will be no Artemis or 20 million dollar lunar orbiter et cetera...

I have seen the film called \\\"The Gay Agenda\\\" and along with my church we found it to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of editting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people are actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as many as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life I have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something obviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian Fundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants your report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed homosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that there are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list. I do not feel threatened by gays, I don't understand why others are.  The following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min- istries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.  THE FOUNDER OF AN \\\"EX-GAY\\\" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO  by Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)  In December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa awards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE INDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering discontented gays and lesbians \\\"a way out of the homosexual death-style\\\" through prayer.  \\\"I'd like to give the award back,\\\" Caligiuri now laughs, \\\"I'm no longer deserve it.\\\"   Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national \\\"ex-gay\\\" movement peaked with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well as Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex- gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  \\\"There's no reality in it,\\\" he says, \\\"I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.\\\"   Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again Christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their sexual urges and embracing Christianity.  \\\"We offer support to people who are seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,\\\" explains Bob Davies, director of Exodus.  He ventures that \\\"about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo- sexuality are men.\\\"   \\\"Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting their time,\\\" says Lisa Seeley, a former \\\"redeemed lesbian\\\" who worked with Caligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  \\\"These organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.\\\"   \\\"It's possible to change your identity or your behavior,\\\" says sex educator Brian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. \\\"But it's really impossible to change your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay, but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.\\\"   Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all hell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both their romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted by a man he picked up in a bar.  \\\"I was really drunk,\\\" he recalls, \\\"and I went home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all night, and the next morning he raped me again.\\\"   When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the home he shared with his ex-lover.  \\\"He had another man there with him,\\\" Caligiuri recalls.  \\\"I thought at this time, 'If this is what being gay is about, I don't want to be this way anymore.\\\"   Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery with others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's gay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its first public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance, Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed for hell.   Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  \\\"We were listed under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,\\\" Caligiuri says, \\\"so people thought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out where the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo- sexuality.\\\"  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says, adding, \\\"They'll do anything to reach these people.\\\"   \\\"David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,\\\" recalls Peter Kelly, a counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program, \\\"like that he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.\\\"   Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on Raphael's syndicated talk show in 1985.  \\\"They were relieved,\\\" he recalls. \\\"They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better that I should be a 'reformed' gay person.\\\"   But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  \\\"By the time I appeared on Sally's show,\\\" \\\"I'd started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline and tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their father.  I was horny all the time.\\\"   Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his numerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he \\\"used to go to bookstores and get blowjobs.\\\"  When he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleeping with other \\\"reformed\\\" homosexuals.   \\\"I didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex with one another,\\\" Caligiuri says.  \\\"We'd go to conferences in other cities, and we'd be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody else.\\\"   By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia' television show in May 1988, Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show's host asked him if he ever \\\"acted on temptation,\\\" his answer was a lie.   Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however.  He was suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating yeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  \\\"I was too sick to go to church,\\\" he explains.  \\\"The more time I spent away from those people the more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.\\\"   Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local church and closed the ministry's doors.  \\\"I'd convinced myself that there is no need in the world for ex-gay people,\\\" he says.   Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (\\\"I'm interest- ed in belief systems that aren't judgemental.\\\"), considering romance (\\\"But not with a CHristian!\\\"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to. \\\"I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,\\\" he says.  \\\"I want to eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I may have brought to our community.\\\"  ---end article---  Caligiuri's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles of former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar th similar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have come to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some, like Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian \\\"Lazarus Project\\\" of West Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community to bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values of sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as \\\"Love In Action\\\" and others, who either once claimed to have been \\\"reformed\\\" or who were too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed in them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of \\\"sealing\\\" their new heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses and bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous \\\"sin\\\" through a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno- cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow gay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also mrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on them, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain functions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common- place.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the threat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington's _\\\"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as Maury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom!_.  I seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and self-acceptance.\",\"I have read that there will be some concrete proposals concerning creation of a \\\"palestinian police force\\\" during the talk's next stage.

Platform: 386/486 class machine.    800x600-16 or 1024x728-16 VGA graphics   (speed is important, 16-color for non-rendering    purpose is enough; may stay at 800x600 for    speed reason.)          (hope the code would be generic enough for different SVGA           cards.  My own card is based on Trident 8900c, not VESA?)  What I'm looking for? 1) fast, very fast routines to draw lines/circles/simple-shapes    on above-mentioned SVGA resolutions.    Presumably in assembly languagine.  Yes, VERY FAST please. 2) related codes to help rotating/zooming/animating the drawings on screen.    Drawings for beginning, would be lines, circles mainly, think of    text, else later.    (you know, the way molecular graphics rotates, zooms a molecule) 2) and any other codes (preferentially in C) that can help the     project.  Final remarks;- non-profit.  expected to become share-, free-ware.   Any help is appreciated.  thanks  -Frankie lau@tammy.harvard.edu\",\" The P&G pots are very good.

It has something to do with the fact that we live in America, and everyone is entitled to whatever he can legally obtain.  If Sandy Alderson and the Haas family willingly negotiate a salary of $35 million per year with Rickey, I couldn't care less.  But what REALLY GETS MY GOAT is the bullshit he spouted in spring training, about `Well... sometimes I may not play as hard, or might be hurt more often, in a place where I'm not appreciated'.  This quote was in the Chronicle about the second week of camp, and strongly suggests that he was going to  dog it all year if the ownership didn't kiss his butt and ante up some more money.  For God's sake, Rickey, you signed a contract 4 years ago, now honor it and play!

EDT              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon  to be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out  the first pitch.              Q   It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not  Amtrack.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's  going from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.              Q   George, what exactly are you prepared to do to  break the logjam with  ??? Senate?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are  discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning,  and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point  that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs  to be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for  summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the  important programs that will put people back to work right away this  summer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be  passed.              Q   Will he compromise, that's the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions  are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and  Senator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President  believes his jobs program should go forward.              Q   George, would the President be willing to accept $8  billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise  being offered by --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being  offered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right  now, let's see what happens today.              Q   Would he go that far -- no matter what the  Republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per  year?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his  program should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be  willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to  come up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's  see what happens.              Q   It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has  happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order  to get a vote?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more  intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in  doing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the  Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the  President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action,  real jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no  question about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative  activity over the last few days.              Q   So, you'll need to compromise to get your package  through?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the  conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.              Q      prepared to compromise --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen  to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting  with Senator Dole.               Q   Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's  been very successful so far in the beginning of his term.              Q   How?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record  time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by  $500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for  important investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong  passage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a  minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock  and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that  he is not succeeding overall.              Q   He can't beat this, can he?              Q   The fact is they can do that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop  action.  There's no question about that.              Q   What are you going to do about it?              Q   George, what do you know about these alleged notes  taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears  that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that  when they say yes they mean no?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete  misreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the  conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring  President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime  Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's  belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.   I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and  etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where  he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese  were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.              Q    Are you saying that the President said that when  the Japanese say yes they mean no?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the  exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say  something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime  Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.              Q   Have there been any attempts to explain this to the  Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and  there appears to be --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the  Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It  does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of  view.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that  there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up  but I'm not positive.              Q   George, was the specific comment that was made  specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general  observation on Japanese etiquette?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --              Q   The specific comment is what I'm asking about that  has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, \\\"when the  Japanese say yes they mean no.\\\"              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean  I don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific  comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific  finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that  Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.              Q   Was he saying it facetiously first?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual  observation.              Q   And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to  clear it up.  Has the President sent a message?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President  spoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but  I'm not sure exactly how many.              Q   Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're  making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got  the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that  it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the  Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure  there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is  on.              Q   What is our position about the Japanese?  That they  may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese  is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two  days.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime  Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S.  position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the  Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's  commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a  constructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to  hear that.              Q   After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq  for the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S.  policy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary  Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have  reiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance  with all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.              Q      throwing it out further that if Iraq complies,  Saddam can't stay in office?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our  judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with  the resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that  we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will  continue to demand it.              Q   And are you concerned the Iran will become the  dominant power in the area --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also  spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect  full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping  support of terrorism.              Q   That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in  power if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you  base that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not  complying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the  rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is  not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.   He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding  armaments.              Q   Well, when do you think that if he did comply he  would be out of power?        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on  the repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make  it more difficult for him to stay in power.              Q   George, back on the stimulus package, why is it  that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure  politics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence  do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical  difference with you that's in good faith?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times  in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the  fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now  seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.                Q   George, in regards to that, some of the moderate  Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to  them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had  one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate  Republicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and  thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some - -              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true  that there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the  Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the  introduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate  Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are  continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who  have an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in  what they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is  important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.              Q      your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats  alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it  through?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is  no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can  frustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.   You only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going  and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.              Q      going to rethink the way you attempt to get  other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of  the summer?              Q      work with Republicans and try to woo some  Republicans into your camp?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to  look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the  President's intiatives?              Q   But on this one -- how are you going to do it  differently than you did it on this one because on this one you  really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear  that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and  could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?   Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for  particular votes?  When you have to go through --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and  understand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the  President's going to continue to reach out when he can.              Q   You don't have any regrets then about the way you  have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your  approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this  experience?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like  his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue  to press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans,  there's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with  them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this  case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around  a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.              Q   They're being denied any other legislative means of  putting their proposals forward.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --              Q      any ideas.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being  defeated; I don't know that they're being denied.              Q      to present them.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean  they get the votes --              Q      that theirs can be passed though by the  parliamentary rules under which they're playing.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in  support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.              Q   George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration  backing any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?              Q      backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for  Iraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of  grooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at  some levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about  anything recently.              Q      Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the  President's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be  some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the  President, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider  something like that, or any other kind of intervention there?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President  appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a  special envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around  the California economic situation, including the situation in Los  Angeles.                I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles  by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary,  Mr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD  Secretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits  by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I  wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to  California.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is  concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy  decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities  which help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to  watch it.              Q   George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also  supposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a  group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball  management.  Does the President have a position on that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received  correspondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson  has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.   He clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in  baseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the  President intends to continue to go to the ball game.              Q   Is he going to say anything about it today, or see  Reverend Jackson while he's out there?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see  them, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has  raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said,  even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.              Q   Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball  game?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe  the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an  informational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to  the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining  his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the  President read it.              Q   George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the  managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be  there, and is he going to meet with the President?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.              Q   What is the Mubarak schedule?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is  coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a  lunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice  President Gore.              Q   And joint statements tomorrow --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end,  yes.              Q   Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did  warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist  activities?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times,  I mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been  general conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a  long period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I  mean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there  was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.   The President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also  reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.              Q   George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians,  apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who,  forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at  the moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in  their attempts to get some kind of action.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would  agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did  say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a  network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate  action.  But there was no specific information on this specific  operation at all.              Q   So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the  law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have  received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in  not pursuing some kind of --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.              Q   What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing  mention in the news conference yesterday --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your  question.              Q   Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted  action between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what  does the U.S. do next?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going  to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our  allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways  to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an  agreement.              Q   George, why do you think sanctions is still an  option?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the  leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait  you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day  said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any  time soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When  does no mean no and you have to do something different?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something  different.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the  U.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to  try and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every  opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.              Q   Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something  that is under consideration.              Q   George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's  condition, how he's doing?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.              Q   George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think  we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning  after the Mubarak visit.              Q   Is he going somewhere for Easter?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.              Q   What more can you tell us about the additional aid  to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with  the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.   I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their  delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the  Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the  next several weeks.              Q   Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude  of the one announced Sunday?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the  magnitude.              Q   How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where  do you stand on that --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday,  he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week  and reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this  week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a  hard look at it.              Q   But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White  House involvement, Congress is compiling this list?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the  congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll  be able to get our own researchers working as well.              Q   George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a  probability than a possibility?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under  discussion.              Q   Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter  of time and -- for months before that happens.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's  something that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working  with our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll  continue to review other matters.              Q   George, can you tell us anything about the schedule  this week?  Any travel?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I  don't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right  now.              Q   Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish  American organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference  of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe,        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National  Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.   We'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate  discussions.              Thanks. \",\"  Not necessarily.  It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road splits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence. There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and Alomar is not a home run hitter.   Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up with ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.  Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.  Regarding the A vs. B argument, I'll just say they're both very good players with different strengths and a bright future. \",\"Are there any Honda groups out there?

In fact, be- fore BATSE, having this widely separated \\\"Interplanetary Network\\\" was the only sure way to locate a random burst.  With only one detector, one cannot locate a burst (except to say \\\"It's somewhere in the field of view.\\\").  With two detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.  With three detectors, one gets intersecting annuli, giving two possible locations.  If one of these locations is impossible (because, say, the Earth blocked that part of the  sky), voila, you have an error box.  BATSE, by having 8 detectors of its own, can do its own location determination, but only to within about 3 degrees (would someone at GSFC, like David, like to comment on the current state of location determination?).

Don't Quadras use the 53C96?  If so, the Mac has nothing to do with the SCSI timing.  That's all handled by the chip.  About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs the clock registers wrong on the 96.  That, however, should only really hurt synchronous transfer, which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager.  Furthermore, disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a Quadra. On Macs that used the 5380, which is a much lower level SCSI chip, the Mac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred.  Blind mode affected how the Mac handled that handshake.

I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published  solutions to it.   The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the  edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw  the object we   1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively  computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the         curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume  that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not  exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable  measure. 2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment  of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two  triangles which will be filled in to color the surface. 3) Depth sort the triangles 4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw  and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is  along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge  colored with a special \\\"edge color\\\"   It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface. The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated. They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area.\",\"    I wouldn't give baserunning that much value.  The above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well.  If Olerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs an extra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold at third.  Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than Alomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a double.)  Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.  No team in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players than others.  Still, the current runs created formulas work just as well in the 1950's for all teams.    Bill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.  They used Harmon Killebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with 38 times caught stealing.  Yet they scored slightly more runs than predicted by Runs Created.   \",\" MLB is perfectly willing to take players from Cuba.  They just have to defect first.

The plan I have is to build a small board with a few different crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different speeds using a front pannel switch.  This way I can get the speed when I want but I can also run at slower (stock) speeds it I experience any compatability problems with any applications.  I don't expect to be able to switch clock speeds with the system running, but if I can switch without any lock-up problems, then I could switch to 33MHz when needed and put it back to idle (20 MHz) when not needeed.

Even as a libertarian, I have to admit government does do some things I like.  There is a beautiful performing arts complex in Ft.

(Keep in mind, though, most of the people in the city will never attend a single performance there, so they might feel differently about having to help pay for it.)  However, I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to give government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis.  In fact, we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely because it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as other issues.  Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  They do not try to decide just whether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speech should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  You can imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority on a case-by-case basis.  Not so with economic issues.  Government does tell taxi-drivers exactly what they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers.  Just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a case-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a case-by-case basis.  There is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with free enterprise.  But there is no hope, in my opinion, of having a government that interferes with free enterprise in an \\\"efficient\\\" manner; I call it political market failure.

That level of analog multiplexing should be rather easy to accomplish.  Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without generating intermodulation.

Yes, there were drunks, saloons, mining camps, and thugs.  However, as McGrath showed, the thugs preyed almost exclusively on one another.  McGrath claims that this was due to the fact that no one much cared if someone who insisted on getting into a fight got his way, even if he lost, while they really did care when thugs preyed on others.   We haven't figured out that those distinctions don't actually work. Machine guns have been strictly regulated since 1934.  Said regulation is both perfect (legally owned machine guns aren't ever used criminally) and a complete waste of time (the criminal use of machine guns hasn't change at all).  The result - we're now arguing about guns that LOOK like machine guns, but are no different than other guns.  -andy\",\"   A developable surface is s.t. you can lay it (or roll it) flat on the plane (it may require you to give it a \\\"cut\\\" though...)  E.g., a cylinder, a cone, a plane (of course!) or any surface or patch having vanishing Gaussian (intrinsic) curvature (i.e., with singular Hessian, the matrix of 2nd derivatives for an adequate coordinate patch) are \\\"developable\\\". In more technical words, a developable surface is \\\"locally isometric to a plane\\\" at all points.   Think also of the sphere (or the earth) which in a non-developable: whatever way(s) you cut it, you will not be able to lay flat any pieces of it... (its intrinsic curvature is nowhere vanishing).

Here are some observations gained from painful experience:    1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.      Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more      sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.    2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear      that these things will itch for months.    3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of      it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,      since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could      find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special      collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is      required to get it.    4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old      folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall      reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers      burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I      think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some      sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.    5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.      A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally      applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is      another preparation called \\\"Chig Away\\\" that is a combination of      sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was      prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In      the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get      up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we      live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They      apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur      as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)    6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget      the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment      that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone      creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine      (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.      Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this      counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think      it gains nothing).    7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved      by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery      as well.  Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money.\",\"Yes, it's possible... in fact, there's some gl widget code in /usr/lpp/GL somewhere...

The military surplus stuff I've driven -- \\\"Jeep Classic\\\" (Willys/Kaiser/AMC, pre-independent suspension) and Power Wagons (Slant 6 in a crew-cab pickup) weren't exactly congenial at highway speeds, and I wouldn't swear any of them would do 80 except as a bedload on a semi.  You just gotta love the standard military tire, too, or at least the one they used to use.  Designed circa WW II as a compromise between traction in icky sticky goo and longevity on sharp rocks and so forth, it's quite ill-adapted to high speeds on civilian roadways.  For those who can't remember what they look like, imagine a mountain-bike tire with a road rib in the middle, scaled up to car size. Oh, yeah, and narrow too. One of the standard mods for civilizing a surplus  Jeep was to install tires and wheels that reflected some of the advancements made in ride and handling since D-Day.  But the point made by Wharfie and others still stands:  if you're going to do 80 in a mil-spec '58 Power Wagon (or a Jeep or a tank transporter or other unwieldy rubber-tired vehicle) anywhere, I'd suggest the American interstate.

Some new drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data writes. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some* track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of boosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.  I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when digitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.

Source: 'The Times,' 3 March 1992  MASSACRE UNCOVERED....  By ANATOL LIEVEN,  More than sixty bodies, including those of women and children, have  been spotted on hillsides in Nagorno-Karabakh, confirming claims  that Armenian troops massacred Azeri refugees. Hundreds are missing.  Scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley  and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday's  massacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees.  From that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of  Askeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters  of Agdam. Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their  own lines.  We landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last  troops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out.  They left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov,  who oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, flew to Stepanakert  to ease their departure.  A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their  dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest. All the  same, two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian  positions.  In all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another  31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days. These figures  do not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed  the Azerbaijani town of Khodjaly on Tuesday night. The figures also  do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies  Zahid Jabarov, a survivor of the massacre, said he saw up to 200  people shot down at the point we visited, and refugees who came  by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and  of leaving a trail of bodies along their path. Around the bodies  we saw were scattered possessions, clothing and personnel documents.  The bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre.  All are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly  clothing of workers.  Of the 31 we saw, only one policeman and two apparent national  volunteers were wearing uniform. All the rest were civilians,  including eight women and three small children. TWO GROUPS,  APPARENTLY FAMILIES, HAD FALLEN TOGETHER, THE CHILDREN CRADLED  IN THE WOMEN'S ARMS.

Indeed, even without special engineering, you can construct a good system right now. A standard codec chip, a chip to do vocoding, a DES chip, a V32bis integrated modem module, and a small processor to do glue work, are all you need to have a secure phone. You can dump one or more of the above if you have a fast processor. With integration, you could put all of them onto a single chip -- and in the future they can be.  Yes, cheap crypto is good -- but we don't need it from the government. You can do everything the clipper chip can do without needing it to be compromised. When the White House releases stuff saying \\\"this is good because it gives people privacy\\\", note that we didn't need them to give us privacy, the capability is available using commercial hardware right now.

Were it not for the NSA and company, cheap encryption systems would be everywhere. As it is, they try every trick in the book to stop it. Had it not been for them, I'm sure cheap secure phones would be out right now.  They aren't the ones making cheap crypto available. They are the ones keeping cheap crypto out of people's hands.

I suspect that they can get cryptosystems themselves on the open market that work just fine -- most of them can't be idiots like the guys that bombed the trade center.

Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable with the use of state sponsored coercion.  The notion that coercion can be virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it is eliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious  consideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.    For example, does \\\"non-initiated force\\\" (coercion) include tax collection? Does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned by Adam Smith?  Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than the state, how is the state to deal with it?  Exclusively through after the fact arbitration/legal compulsion?     Well, I must admit that the picture of libertarians as Amway participants is somewhat more reassuring than the idea of them trying to govern a  complex, conflictual, industrial society.  I'd venture to point out,  however, that if libertarians couldn't convince at least 85% of a group  of \\\"seminar participants\\\" to \\\"embrace\\\" their philosophy, their  propaganda skills need to be honed.    Frankly, however, it is no great trick to create a government for a  society in which (almost) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper government policy.  Once that is assumed, all sorts of annoying formalities can be dispensed with, elections, police, etc.  And as Mr. Marx said, the state will just wither away.    On the way there, however, would you like to explain how eliminating  virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the  current society will help us to live happier lives? Or is it like socialism; just some short-term pain that we'll have to bear until  everyone has had the benefit of \\\"re-education\\\" through regular  \\\"seminar\\\" training?  jsh \",\"We will be holding a bake and craft sale at Communiversity in Princeton on   Nassau Street, Saturday April 24th 12-4 p.m. to benefit the Recurrent   Respiratory Papillomatosis Foundation, a nonprofit foundation established to   encourage research toward a cure for Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Our   three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release   that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.   On Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family   will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public   awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Bill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease   characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and   trachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would   lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.    Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis   last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her   lifetime.    Even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives   of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory   Papillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide   support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a   newsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid   in the prevention, cure, and treatment.  Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to   those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money   were available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant   attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP   Foundation's mission is to change that.   Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call   Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the   Foundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown   Princeton, or sent directly to:\",\"    We already got him under Pitchers, Overrated, Jewish.   Probably.  Is SHirley P still alive?  Just wondering.\",\" You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to be contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions? What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time? This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically stood by the Pope.  It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over authority and discipline.    My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:    Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   don't jointly make such  choice.)  If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority. If I adopt the view that \\\"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\\\", that I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  The Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdiction viewing authority as present in each bishop, and in Ecumenical Councils.  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines  regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of the Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going into the merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree that a split occurred, and don't paly what appear to be semantic games like \\\"He's the Pope, but we don't recognize that what he does is effective...\\\".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \\\"real\\\" traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.    I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.` I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility? Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand. Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome, one way or the other.   It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.    True enough.   One could argue that they are establishing a non-geographic jurisdiction. I don't know if that's even a concept or problem in Catholic circles.

According to Jerry Taylor, Cato's director of natural resource studies,   we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10   times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of   1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as   dramatically.      When standards of living, population densities, and industrial   structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy   efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group   of Seven nations.      Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil   price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the   cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,   even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the   overall U.S. economy.      Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per   $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.      Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side   management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource   inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not   reduce demand.      Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes   unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that   subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,   gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood   of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state   at the expense of the individual.      \\\"Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion\\\" is no.   189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an   independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.

To that end, the Institute strives to achieve   greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in    questions of policy and the proper role of government.     The Institute is named for Cato's Letters, libertarian pamphlets   that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th   century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation   of the American Revolution.     Despite the achievement of the nation's Founders, today virtually   no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive   intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary   intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for   civil liberties.     To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive   publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy   issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned   to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military   spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy   conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are   published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.     In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts   no government funding.  Contributions are received from foundations,   corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from   the sale of publications.  The Institute is a nonprofit, tax-exempt,   educational foundation under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue   Code.\",\"I recently read here that Sun has a patch for xdm on Solaris2.1.

There is a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts without active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really beautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three deacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor. This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion that John would prefer.  But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations. Each pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracy against participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial blessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already getting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they should not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation --- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be necessary to go with the briefer options just to \\\"get 'em in and get 'em out\\\".  Each parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to their geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish in the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy closer to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow parishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors generally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly to the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.  Perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't follow the continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no single one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated equilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them, then the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering the names of the evolutionary theories.}\",\" It's there.....\",\" Actually, the story goes that Lucifer refused to bow before MAN as  God commanded him to.

As far as collectivity/speculation is concerned they think it is a  waste of time, especially the later rubber bumpered models are the least desirable, a 1962 original model the most. The reasons for its low value are easy availability and the fact that it just was not a very good car.\",\"  So, like, what do you do during those six months to be \\\"active?\\\" My town has a similar requirement, and it's rather stupid.  Before you can buy a handgun, you have to be an active member of a gun club. Well, how active can you be without a gun, chief?  Most gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental disorders would be a very good thing -- IF it couldn't be abused by the government.  But every time this is proposed, there is always some trapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you are perfectly qualified to own a gun.  And we oppose this.   Since the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US  is around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun owners, I'd think twice before using this analogy.  Besides, the problem is criminal use of guns, not accidents.  (There are about 500,000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year -- but only 1,400 accidents.)  I don't think it's necessary to spend a lot of energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one.  Just like the check, most gun owners feel positively about requiring safety courses -- IF they couldn't be abused by the government.  But  they already have!  One state doesn't hold the courses, another doesn't  fund them, a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence  to those with political connections.  Is this fair?   And how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets? How many are borrowed, stolen, smuggled, bought on the black market?   Some states allow ONLY open carry.  Some allow ONLY concealed carry. Some allow both.  Some allow both, but require licenses for concealed  carry.  All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage over another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good, then state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing. Which means that they really don't have any objective reasons for  these laws other than their preferences -- a bad way to govern.   (\\\"Hot-livered.\\\"  I LOVE that expression.  Here, we say \\\"hot-headed.\\\")   Typically, the only criminals who can affect the rights of ALL the other people are criminals in government offices.  The rest of our criminals affect the rights of only one or a few people at a time, and they do this during the commission of a crime.  POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts NO ONE else.  It is when they do something violent with that gun that the crime occurs.  Of course, it is a crime for a felon or ex-felon to possess a gun, but we don't feel it is right to treat common citizens who have lived good lives as if they were just \\\"pre-felons\\\" waiting to commit crimes.   I don't understand this sentence.   Life isn't fair.  I shouldn't need a fire extinguisher either, or flood and theft insurance, or to lock the doors of my house and car. But pining for a better world won't do anything to address what I have to do to live in this one.   None of ours, I'm sure.   Frankly, I'm not sure I know what good a driver's license does anyone, either.  The people who drive safely never use it, and the people who  drive drunk, drive without it!  However, a car is a good tool, but not one that protects my right to life. I rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely.   The question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally.  It's whether or not you think that ALL people should be forced to do as you do. I don't have any problem with someone who says they would never own a gun. I do have a problem with someone who says I should be prevented from owning one, too. -- \",\"  Terms are being used in a loaded way here.  \\\"Logical proof\\\" is an extremely messy thing to apply to real life.

On the other hand, some people  seem to start tuning out `the same old words' and pay attention better  when things get changed around.  I think innovative priests and liturgy  committees are trying to get our attention and make things more  meaningful for us.  It drives me crazy too.   Different people have differing preferences and needs in liturgy.  My  local parish is innovative.  I prefer to go to Mass at the next parish  over.  Sometimes we don't have the option of attending a Mass in the  style which best suits us.  John put a smiley on it but to \\\"just offer  it up\\\" probably is the solution.  A related issue, that it sounds like John does not have to deal with, is  that spouses may have different liturgical tastes.  My husband does like  innovative litury.  It is a challenge to meet both of our spiritual  needs without just going our separate ways.  When you include the factor  of also trying to satisfy our children's needs, things get pretty  complicated.

In fact it cleared up,  became warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I took a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride. They had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours before I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom -- surrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.  Today was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes, 50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat Touring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot. Some sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one MSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on the back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that Cycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like a big moto party.  After about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime, and another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/ pray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the parking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from  the Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else into the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the  ST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of the road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a bicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.  Well I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could  think was \\\"big\\\".  Then I put one foot up.  \\\"Heavy\\\" came to mind very quickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to  tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.  By 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even on bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that  did not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is on a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north of the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95 splits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access highway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton,  Manchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester. On its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about 30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many thoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.  Cindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along in top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane  changes were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this  thing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the fairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was non-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless. Smooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of, but it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless buzz.  The jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the brakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius, decreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.   The section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok in this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack oft featured in \\\"Spencer for Hire\\\" -- a place where you could really  find \\\"Spencer\\\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting through traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.  About half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal for \\\"hold on tight\\\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second gear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a  short shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light traffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new. Well, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort lane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went  until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed there.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering,  I looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.  Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \\\"get off in a mile\\\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted to re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were several manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the  slow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could  see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed to thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad out front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put the thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side stand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.   My demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable, hardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than  list, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.\",\"Elias' initial statement certain *is* hot air.

Frankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of the original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the writings of the era. This  is most refreshing.  Second, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days. My brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend to several matters pertaining to the State Militia.  Some people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro- nism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swiss would agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, both organized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State, Mississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar to one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocks of both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary but are probably similar.  Title 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as \\\"all able-bodied citizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty- two (62) years...\\\". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National Guard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The National Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective. It tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion of this \\\"para-constitutional\\\" arrangement is quite interesting in itself but somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at this date, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing as anything but a Federal reserve force.  Mississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organized Militia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other  States it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as a cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and senior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill on a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once a quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our State-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an organization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will come from the unorganized Militia.  In time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can order the activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will first be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either its contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the event that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law provides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the unorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by law, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militia of Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the State does not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such a force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use of mostly the private arms of the Militiamen.   It is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being the long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.   Regarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the sole representative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will have chosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist end of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, can be chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that the idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia or \\\"train bands\\\" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern- ment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to provide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years, and iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever, \\\"terrible and irresistible\\\".  These protections included: State control, not Federal; limitation of Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and Bear Arms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington. These limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern- ment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.  The National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the  Constitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting wars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The Constitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by the Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the War of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United States territory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutional authorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal Military and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until WW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer. When the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new member also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were \\\"grandfathered\\\". At least one of these \\\"grandfathered\\\" individuals refused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the Federal Courts.  Mr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to members of a \\\"well organized\\\" militia. However, the pre-Constitutional history of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when The Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton's definition of \\\"well organized\\\". In the period of peace between the French & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped drilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution. Perhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors who answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because their units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not be so bold.  Again, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, is not the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton nor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government and many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing of their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their responsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the Constitution.   Misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one error that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The Constitution prohibits States from keeping \\\"Troops or Ships of War in time of Peace\\\". I have heard some insist this prevents States from maintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do not understand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage. Today we call any large vessel a \\\"ship\\\" but in the 18th century the word described a particular kind of vessel.  A \\\"ship\\\" is a large vessel with three or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A \\\"brig\\\" has two masts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping the largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today's equivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles. \\\"Troops\\\" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization. Any study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out.   In at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being personally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia as a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequently both bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on their place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or scarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State's Militia.\",\"from Anna Matyas:  Yeah, and also be second in the team in scoring and play about 35 minutes a game and play on the power play and kill penalties and be the best defenseman in the league.

An Appeal to Mankind  During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums, documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.  The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace.  The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.  Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland. Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan. Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives  of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.  One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection  of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance, for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled, its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over  the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the USSR and the United States.   One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent  events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on Azerbaijan.  It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we  are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic  Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.  But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000 Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the  neighboring lands.  The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales, suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.  But what about the lives of seven million human beings? If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their  colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other attributes?  All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.    THE COMMITTEE FOR PEOPLE'S HELP TO                  KARABAKH (OF THE) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES                  OF THE AZERBAIJAN SSR   But perhaps Turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the Caucasus in the name of peace and democracy. The Armenians are Christians, the Azerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved by the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights.   Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims at 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole thing has now gone entirely too far.   They already did. The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians  78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this  time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the  plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs.   Report taken from The New York Times, Tuesday, March 3, 1992                      MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED       Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today  of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh,  a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.      The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed 1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and  massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered mountain passes.      But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani reports of a massacre.                           Scalping Reported      Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them  from retrieving more bodies.      \\\"Women and children have been scalped,\\\" said Assad Faradshev, an aide to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. \\\"When we began to pick up bodies, they began firing at us.\\\" are lying there like flocks of sheep.

Present claims are based on prior ownership (purchase   from aforementioned absentee landlords) award by the United Nations in the   partition of the Palestine mandate territory, and as the result of   defensive wars fought against the Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians, et al.  *** First, I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the   idea that the West Bank is theirs. Since,  however, I agree with those who   claim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West   bank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion   to attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis   promptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining   possession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats   national suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it   is that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them   and the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs   continues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they   can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West   Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is   the small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West   Bank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even   leftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't   going to propose giving up Jerusalem.

Matthew     Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on     Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material     posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).  US PLANETARY MISSIONS       MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed     minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the     onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the     Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted     from the expression \\\"R-dot-bar sub n\\\" (nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.      MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December     of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a     very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world     with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).      MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar     panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.      MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and     took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it     flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that Mars was a \\\"dead\\\" world in both the     geological and biological sense.      MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information     that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface     of an ocean.      MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away     the concept of Mars as a \\\"dead\\\" planet, first made from the basic     measurements of MARINER 4.      MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed.      MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to     orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no     other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian     surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.      MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe     did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed     Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.       PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph     the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide     new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new     data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft     had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on     October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.      PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first     U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally     designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead     studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to     36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6     through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,     and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would     have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.      PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER     11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to     study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through     1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever     to do so.      PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER     12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made     the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus     2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere     in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the     atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the     surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day     probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before     its batteries failed.       RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)      RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They     were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems     left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.      RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an     instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the     launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.     RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the     camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.      RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but     suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,     the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.      RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost     all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon     and drifted off into solar orbit.      RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send     back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact     with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras     did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first     U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.       LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)      LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image     various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO     missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our     understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.     All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were     essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.     probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar     surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.       SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)      The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar     module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the     soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered     in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing     vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was     strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.      Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the     first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images     and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from     SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,     the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored     the Tycho crater region in 1968.       VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)      VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on     a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June     19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse     Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for     Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes     found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of     its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was     pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is     pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the     thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and     boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.      The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran     out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a     weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep     functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command     had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until     further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the     engineers' efforts through May of 1983.      An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the     Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the     lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,     D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until     it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.      VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit     on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in     Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its     sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording     one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in     1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut     down on April 12, 1980.      The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.       VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)      VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March     5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched     August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,     1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and     by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare     once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to     outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,     but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.      Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their     satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered     that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and     aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major     surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous     volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.      When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets     and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep     the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive     jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle     is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was     startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.     The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,     kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.      VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,     continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly     monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was     found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational     axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on     Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10     satellites and one more ring were discovered.      In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,     including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright     patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were     discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a     canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)      The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their     on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets     beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the     location of the heliopause.   SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS      Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and     Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:       SOVIET LUNAR PROBES      LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first       craft in solar orbit.     LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.     LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.     ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was       also a test for future Mars missions.     LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images       from surface.     LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.     LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.     ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8       accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were       unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.     LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil        to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in        1972.     LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's        surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished        with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.     LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in        1976.       SOVIET VENUS PROBES      VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions         lost enroute in 1961.     VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with         VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in         February of 1966. No images were returned.     VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.         Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe         became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.     VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending         through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before         reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles         similar in 1969.     VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet         in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in         1972.     VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the         first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar         mission.     VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.   VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.     VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of   planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.     VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian       atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on       to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in       March of 1986.       SOVIET MARS PROBES      MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased       enroute the following year.     ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian       surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.     MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian       surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red       Planet in 1971.     MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander       signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.     MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to       fire, probe went on into solar orbit.     MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in       1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.       probe MARINER 9.     MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.     MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit       with its flyby bus.     PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest         moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to         human/computer error.     PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did         enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week         before scheduled Phobos landing.      While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even     interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have     yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,     Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a     Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been     planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now     the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their     space program remains to be seen.   JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS      SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on     January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km     on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to     measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of     which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on     January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest     approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The     geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for     a Japanese spacecraft.      During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail     passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby     will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third     October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).       HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,     1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten     once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first     lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget     satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.      The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An     apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists     to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March     19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The     rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt     camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.      Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and     performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten     made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,     1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and     fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into     lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the     approach:   Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km  Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km  Inclination : 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)  Period  : 4.7 days   PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES      I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three     groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,     and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means     complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your     research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can     add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.      Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it     would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in     order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in     this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date     general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra     background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good     public and university library. Some of the more recently published works     can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market     bookstore.      General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):        J.

Other works and periodicals:      NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space     probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry     these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission     you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study     some of the books listed above.      Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL     GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's     Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,     SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER     missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the     VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.      More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions     can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and     SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major     newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,     but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events     were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are     affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you     probably know.      Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you     might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space     groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their     periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe     missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,     Pasadena, California 91106 USA.      Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I     personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas     in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from     it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

Murder happens to innocent people, not people whose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that these soldiers, in the line of duty, were killed by the opposition. And resistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munich were victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters). Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by resistance fighters. Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the hostile occupiers in WWII.

Excuse me?   \\\"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as    ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work    of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village.    Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts    into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable    and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets    completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They    found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border    into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole    length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to    Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain    plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of    Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for    howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the    scattered bones of the dead.\\\"                                Ohanus Appressian                             \\\"Men Are Like That\\\"                                    p. 202.   A genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an  attempt to exterminate a race. This is the worst crime in history.  It happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian  dictatorship. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst  ways imaginable. It is sickening to think that the human race is capable  of such actions, but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian  genocide of 2.5 million Muslims happened.  People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were  killed in the Turkish genocide. I understand their anger that there  are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place,  despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million Turks has been  well documented over the past six decades. We cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race.

Mark Alan Epstein, 'The Ottoman Jewish Communities and their Role   in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries,' Klaus Schwarz Werlag,   Freiburg (1980).    page 19:   <<During the fifteenth century, when the Ottomans were struggling to   reestablish themselves in the Balkans, there was considerable turmoil   among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe. Even if   the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the   fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which   Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the   Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the   realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution   in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews   fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that   the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that   there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and   eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the   effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and   persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection   of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,   was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>>     page 21:    <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official   in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi   Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and   the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation   of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from   Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two   recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom   of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European   coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.   This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant   conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of   travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who   would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*)     page 41:   <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were  firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them  and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians  of Europe.   Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is  also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews  as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.  Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians  representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European  sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition  it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,''  their  sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who  regularly reported to the Ottomans.   There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans  in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances  of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited  instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the  early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy  for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman  document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some  Greek towns...>>   page 43:    <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally  accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,  and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of  the situation.>>    page 46:   <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not  particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common  interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition  which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If  there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between  religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was  that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with  the Orthodox.>>   page 46:   <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context  during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of  interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed  Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already  existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish  response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian  countries to Ottoman domains.>>   page 151:    <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the   Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would   characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,   in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and   the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions   elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the   Jews recognized their mutual interests...>>    page 161:    <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success   of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success   in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both   cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough   to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success   without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve   the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear   that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable   partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived.   We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their   success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the   Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries   the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>>   (*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati's [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw:    page 32:    <<Your cries and sobs reached us. We have been told of all the troubles   and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear   the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly   oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and   prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob   and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They   wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren, to the counsel I will   give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German   rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land,   which is blessed by God and filled with all good things. Here I found rest   and happiness; Turkey can also become for you the land of peace...If you   who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with   in this land, you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out   to come to us...Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain   of. We possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. We are   not oppressed with heavy taxes, and our commerce is free and unhindered.   Rich are the fruits of the earth. Everything is cheap, and every one of us   lives in peace and freedom. Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow   hat as a badge of shame, as is the case in Germany, where even wealth and   great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy   among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him   to rob him of his gold. Arise my brethren, gird up your loins, collect   your forces, and come to us. Here you will be free of your enemies, here   you will find rest...>>[13]  [13] Israel Zinberg, A History Of Jewish Literature. vol.V.

I must congratulate your analytical and excellent reportage about  Diana. From  the writings  of tye biographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe chauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian genes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian, she   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong characteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian ancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian from  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant Thedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady Diana. It is noteworthy  that Eliza Kewark was also referred  to as  Mrs. Forbesian  (a characteristic Armenian  surname  ending).  An  Armenian-Scottish gene mix is dynamite.  Levon K. Topuzian Assistant Professor Northwestern University Skoie, Illinois.  TIME, December 21, 1992 'Letters'   You have set up straw horses and knocked them down. I'm not impressed. Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.   Source: Stanford J. Shaw, on Armenian collaboration with invading Russian armies in 1914, \\\"History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey (Volume II: Reform, Revolution & Republic: The Rise of Modern Turkey, 1808-1975).\\\" (London, Cambridge University Press 1977). pp. 315-316.  \\\"In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city   of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population,   closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan   on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized   and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during   the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the  southern side of the lake.\\\"  \\\"Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,  Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.  Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First  World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse  to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other  invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian  success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of  Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common  soldiers began deserting in droves.\\\"  \\\"With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of  World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy  increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,  Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn  massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of  expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.\\\"  Serdar Argic\",\" Of course it is!

Since Hartford is pitiful, the Islanders played pitiful.  Since Pittsburgh is great, the Isles will most likely play great.  This is most likely due to inexperience and very poor shooting.  To Greg: yes, I have noticed that the Islanders couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with the puck if they were two feet in front of it.  Does anyone have shooting percentages?

Why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone? You see, there is more to the shelling of the villages.... it is called RETALIATION... \\\"GETTING BACK\\\" ...\\\"GETTING EVEN\\\". It doesn't make sense to shell the villages. The least it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli government for the lives of civilians.

I think Basil is a very intelligent person and I respect what he writes. Basil is a person that I would gladly call a friend. He is, however, not me. Nor am I Lebanese, as some seem to suspect.    Tim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been disarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah does not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up Sheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. Of course, if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't make the Lebanese so mad as to do that. Furthermore, with Hezbollah  subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.   Tim, when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border? Not lately, eh?  Israel knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would use territory under their control to attack Israel. While Lebanon would be better off with Syria and Israel out of its borders, the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on Israeli territory (not on Israeli troops in Lebanon, however. Please note the distinction) in the past two years.   I disagree, Basil has always seemed to me to be a cool-headed person, slow to anger (certainly more so than I). What is most important is that he is an  actual witness to things from the other end of the Israeli guns.

A:  Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14.  the 195 is the     overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually     narrower.  The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the     sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire     has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel     diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'     tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like     390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed     rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly     inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common     speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to     150MPH.)      Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed     rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find     designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load     associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous     operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is     a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum     per-tire loads:      Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157     Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125      Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.      In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire     size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation     indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application     of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters     only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of     interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For     the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference     between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at     all.      If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.      Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating     reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)      There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,     traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded     A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is     a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they     are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are     thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.  Q:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put     normal tires on the car?  A:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.     Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible     with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them     so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that     more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)     You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your     car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly     dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,     or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard     to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear     has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.  Q:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side     of my car?  A:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many     say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a     car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others     (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping     is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before     rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.  Q:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the     car should I put them on?  A:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't     get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow     conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there     are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear     wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car     going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car     (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,     stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the     snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes     while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.  Radar Detectors and Speed Limits:  Q:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits     in this Q&A posting?  A:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between     misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless     flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please     subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.  Safety Equipment:  Q:  Do airbags really work?  A:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much     better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than     Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than     3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend     to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the     explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but     not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention     of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.  Brake Questions:  Q:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas     always wants to do this.  A:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing     rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors     more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped     warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or     to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas     are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical     to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,     or badly grooved.  Q:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is     this really a good idea?  A:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade     prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of     downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases     of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more     than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they     are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.      On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA     still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I     suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to     do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a     car with an automatic to take the test.  Q:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?  A:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to     absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake     system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type     are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The     principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry     boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling     point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest     wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better     boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling     point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see     the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that     DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific     cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly     competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_     improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for     DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out     fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid     out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.  Q:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?  A:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks     excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone     based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and     DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound     like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in     such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any     metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend     to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where     most of the corrosion occurs.      Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to     Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly     beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the     brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.      Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are     difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which     interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they     generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they     do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable     in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense     in some street car applications, but they are certainly not     recommended for high performance driving applications, and the     economics are questionable for street use.      I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard     that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably     compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little     information at this time.  Q:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs     more.  Is it worth it?  A:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will     be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer     is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally     work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does     not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),     and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques     like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.      Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the     car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able     be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several     systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is     what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence     of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed     sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and     may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original     equipment or OE-equivalent components.      When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking     the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the     system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS     will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a     sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could     sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is     achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as     the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are     truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system     this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this     duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;     on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform     threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on     snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes     locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,     has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this     eventuality.      A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves     steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are     braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release     the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off     on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.     Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.      An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical     braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on     glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.     The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an     ABS system in your car.      As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential     restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the     following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder     for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master     cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for     over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5     (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of     the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system     components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid     becomes very important.  Q:  What about this threshold braking business?  A:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent     publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers     in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is     needed here -- rpw]      Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high     performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab     the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much     to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate     maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but     just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold     brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn     to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake     pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the     threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.     In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're     not very near the threshold.      In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just     before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on     the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very     close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better     stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS     take over.      Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of     accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with     ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed     the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now     seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the     involved officers had any recent performance driving training.     There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing     brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique     of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to     try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you     think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must     cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least     1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that     much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.     Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective     and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if     you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at     the pedal will be sufficient.      Gas Questions:  Q:  Does High Octane gasoline help?  A:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the     engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.     On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your     car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car     needs.  Q:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?  A:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,     although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase     in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded     gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,     check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not     actually require leaded gasoline.  Q:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?  A:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use     dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.     Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl     Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs     and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.      Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes     called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's     manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider     10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol     (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected     cars.      An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with     fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that     do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain     Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything     in your gas tank.      There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are     noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work     much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,     Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,     once every six months, is highly recommended.  Q:  What about detergent gasolines?  A:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW     has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this     test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test     are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such     gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.     Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean     engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.  Lubrication Questions:  Q:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?  A:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter     code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer      uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are     for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine     applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels     of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,     SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.      The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either     a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by     the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly     used these days, and are the only type that most automobile     manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the     designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;     the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity     of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually     get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What     is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity     of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast     as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the     viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.      Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not     all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all     30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the     novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has     been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils     do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,     15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.  Q:  Are `quick lube' places any good?  A:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out     there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure     that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on     your wallet at all times.  Q:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?  A:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have     come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based     additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the     chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,     auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET     responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight     increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term     results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are     debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the     product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes     deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners     have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of     Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50     Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as     it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are     no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.      On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.  Q:  Do synthetic oils really work?  A:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,     but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by     oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to     change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your     car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change     the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty     as conventional oils.      Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter     entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very     effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.  Q:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.     How often should I change my oil?  A:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)     gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs     down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,     you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you     only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up     to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,     perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are     now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car     much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change     oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,     then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out     of storage.  Misc. Questions:  Q:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they     break.  What's the story?  A:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,     for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but     the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.     Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.      If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the     belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent     replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if     there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time     (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have     a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,     destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage     as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water     pump can be a costly mistake.)  Q:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it     self destructs when the timing belt breaks?  A:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the     valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression     ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are     more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance     oriented vehicles.  Q:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?  A:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety     Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be     caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the     same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report     goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator     is probably the cause.\",\"mile.\\\"  Ravi,   Its not a good idea to have a horizontally formatted hard disk in a   vertical position.

But how do you propose we take government back?  They obviously don't listen to the people or want the people to know who is responsibile for what (a person telnetted the site of the Clipper chip release, to see what the entity 'clipper' was, and got a few lists. BUt when another person tried a bit later, the commands were disabled) Does not sound like an Administration that wants to have any accountability or information they don't control given to the people.  The secret development and implimentation of the Clipper Chip decision further backs that up.

I think we need to distinguish etymology from meaning.  Regardless of how the word 'Easter' *originated*, the fact is that it does not *now* mean anything to Christians other than 'the feast day of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ'.   The meaning of a word is _only_ what people understand it to mean.  And the same goes for other cultural practices.  The festival of Easter may possibly have some historical association with some pagan festival, but *today* there are, as far as I know, no Christians who *intend* to honor any kind of \\\"pagan goddess\\\" by celebrating Easter.

Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer screwed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question. Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16\\u00b5sec occur. This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some devices can \\\"hiccup\\\" in the middle of blocks.  If this happens in the middle of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte depending on which direction the tranfer was going.  In anycase the SCSI Manager will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because it is out of sync.  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't pay attention to the errors coming back.  Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but rather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager.  The problem occurs when the processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte hasn't been clocked yet.  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus error handler and doesn't crash the machine...\",\"  Contact Chris Arthur at Chris_Arthur@pennies.stratus.com He restores lots of old video and arcade games and knows where to get parts.

The scenario you outline is reasonably  consistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does not support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by latest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for about 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at most) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before there were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease... mostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just fossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what brought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then how could it exist before humans?  [deletions]   Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about biology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There is no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off' in perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a collective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the degeneration of the genetic code'.    Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But it still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as much damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even when people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed', (forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and died off for lack of nearby hosts.  I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few hundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to be getting less nasty w/age...    Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right? And, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It seems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift humans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less lethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems, imperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us by God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made our immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases?    Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the phrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect' system would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system that will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a perfect system. At least, IMHO.  Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the original genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart? If so, why could God not have used better materials?  Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself, of did It just choose not to?  [deletions]   My main point, as I said, was that there really isn't any evidence for the explanation you give. (At least, that I'm aware of.) But, I couldn't help making a few nitpicks here and there. :->  Sincerely,\",\" There has been NO hard info provided about MSG making people ill. That's the point, after all.   That's because these \\\"peer-reviewed\\\" studies are not addressing the effects of MSG in people, they're looking at animal models. You can't walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects demonstrated in humans.  Note that I wouldn't have any argument with a statement like \\\"noting that animal administration has pro- duced the following [blah, blah], we must be careful about its use in humans.\\\"  This is precisely NOT what you said.   It most certainly is for neurotoxicology.  You know, studies of glutamate involve more than \\\"food science\\\".   So, point us to the studies in humans, please.  I'm familiar with the literature, and I've never seen any which relate at all to Olney's work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons.   Well, actually, they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine; it's a essential amino acid.  They just try to get as little as is healthy without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the blood.   Goodness, I'm not saying that it's good to feed infants a lot of glutamate-supplemented foods.  It's just that this \\\"projected safety margin\\\" is a construct derived from animal models and given that, you can \\\"prove\\\" anything you like.  We're talking prudent policy in infant nutrition here, yet you're misrepresenting it as received wisdom.   You mean \\\"asserting\\\".  You're being intellectually dishonest (or just plain confused), because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other.  Olney's reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants, but that's not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods, nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects (for obvious reasons.)  It says nothing about MSG's contribtion to the phenomenon of the \\\"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\\\".  It says nothing about the frequent inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab.

I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the  future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.    There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger  of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan.  10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition,  shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic  rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll  limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent  with your note.    First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Second, publication of some latter-day \\\"scientific study\\\" doesn't  alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my  interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.    Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Fourth, as often happens with these things, the \\\"study\\\" doesn't  support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions  anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older  body of lies, omissions, and distortions.    Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on  countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND  BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this  present \\\"study\\\" dubious, to say the least.    Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat  (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you  should be better aware than most people how \\\"progress\\\" -- in  designing \\\"studies\\\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our  ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree  on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30  years to create \\\"studies\\\" \\\"proving\\\" that pornography causes crime.   More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s  clearly indicate the contrary.    Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Tenth, another reason to doubt all such \\\"studies\\\" is that human  behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The  attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the  resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.    Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Twelfth, the \\\"study\\\" is also worthless because it incorporates  figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but  basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social  benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a  criminal offense.    Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials  quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are  many), are correct in this instance:  the \\\"study\\\" is meaningless  because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    And because of that, Adrian, even if the \\\"study\\\" were valid, it  wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that  anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however,  whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's  permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists  themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed  people to go out and buy their first gun \\\"while they still can\\\".   Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the \\\"shooting fraternity\\\"  viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate,  ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in  the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys,  and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we  probably manufacture at least that many every year.  The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly  aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what  their real motives are.    Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way,  it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic;  the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the  self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing  this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a  quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \\\"half life\\\"  of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna  be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.  As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law  provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I  will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is  that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands  -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can  only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given  both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics  and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.    So what's the point?    L.

In Manchester, CT a few years ago, a small company wanted to run a game system galled \\\"LaserGames,\\\" similar in many aspects to Photon (tm). Three lawyers and about a hundred citizens found an ancient law in Manchester's books which clearly from context was designed to prohibit travelling carnivals by enumerating the features of a carnival which they felt at the time made the prohibition obvious. Among these things was \\\"shooting galleries,\\\" which is what the lawyers for the opposition to LaserGames wanted to harp upon. The judge took the two words from this law, completely out of context, and ruled that LaserGames could not operate in Manchester.    Keep in mind that most travelling carnivals use projectile weapons in their shooting galleries, and not light beams. Clearly from context, LaserGames got shafted, but if the two words are applied, their denial of operating permission was justified.    If I had the text of the law I'd post it, but I'm afraid I don't remember it all well enough to even try. That little bit with the two words stuck well, though.\",\"     We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu- tion  from the rest of the team's.  There is only one way of determin- ing \\\"best\\\" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best that day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro- cess  used to determine the \\\"best\\\" is the score of the game and it re- lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.  To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.  If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the only measure of \\\"best\\\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base- ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham- pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub- jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.   Exactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with Clemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens. I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.   You don't have to be rude.   For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per- formance.  The stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new knowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less  incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.  -- \",\"     The immunization program is just a \\\"useful first step\\\".

When I installed NDW, it wanted to rem out the line that installed EP (EP /ON) and the command to invoke the Image utility. It replaced the Image command with a new image command that invokes the version of Image that came with NDW.  This makes sense, as presumably the Image version with NDW is newer than the one with NU.  It did not, however, install smartcan in the autoexec.  Now two questions:    1:  Will NU use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked.        i.e. Are the two version of Image compatable?    2:  Will erase protect use the info from smartcan, and vice versa?

The older models are VERY well built. Unless Toyota lost its mind, I would assume, until  proven otherwise, that the newer models have inherited some if not all of the qualities of their ancestors.  Two major differences in the running gear (that I'm aware of) need study. My '79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have independant front suspension. The solid axle is theoretically stronger and more reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The independant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy the typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. I'm not sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive system. The older Landcruisers have a \\\"lock-up\\\" type. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.\",\"I posted this over in sci.astro, but it didn't make it here.

A NASA friend and I spent one    drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar we'd need    to put the golden arches of a certain American fast food organization    on the face of the Moon.  Fortunately, we sobered up in the morning.  Hmmm. It actually isn't all that much, is it? Like about 2 million km^2 (if you think that sounds like a lot, it's only a few tens of m^2 per burger that said organization sold last year). You'd be best off with a reflective substance that could be sprayed thinly by an unmanned craft in lunar orbit (or, rather, a large set of such craft). If you can get a reasonable albedo it would be visible even at new moon (since the moon itself is quite dark), and _bright_ at full moon. You might have to abandon the colour, though.  Buy a cheap launch system, design reusable moon -> lunar orbit unmanned spraying craft, build 50 said craft, establish a lunar base to extract TiO2 (say: for colour you'd be better off with a sulphur compound, I suppose) and some sort of propellant, and Bob's your uncle.

However the Q700 upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21\\\" with 8 bit depth and up to 16\\\" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).

If market reform does happen, Russia will certainly get *private* capital at *private* risk to help their economy.  They will even have incentive to do so for the same reason.  If they don't reform, then our government will probably consider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help them.  Then their's the ideological point.  We want to \\\"win\\\" Russia over to our type of government -- a type where the rulers can rule without limit over everyone's finances?
