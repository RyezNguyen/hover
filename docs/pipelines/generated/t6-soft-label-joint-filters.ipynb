In any case, that has nothing to do with the current case.  The claim against the ADL is that it illegally obtained and disseminated information that was gathered by state and/or federal agencies in the course of their standard interaction with citizens such as myself.  By that I refer to things such as: address and phone number, vehicle registration and license information, photographs, etc.   You should ask the ADL, if you want an authoritative answer.  My guess is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in political criticism of Israel.  I further believe that they did this as agents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them. At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to Israeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence, or attempt to influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.  These matters will be brought out as the court case unfolds, since California law entitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.  As my previous posting shows, California law entitles people to compensation even in the absence of any specific consequences -- just for the further dissemination of certain types of private information about them.\",\"The idea of the card is bull in and of its self, but I'm curious to know, do  they plan on making it a requirement to *always* have it on you, or is it  only going to be required to be *presented* when trying to ge medical aid?

That is because your premises are wrong from the word \\\"Go\\\".  You claim that Christianity is based on blind faith, but this simply is not so.  Just look at the current thread on the evidence for Jesus' resurrection for evidence that Jesus was real and that he triumphed over death.  Furthermore, you say that Christians hold to their beliefs \\\"regardless of any evidence that you may find to the contrary.\\\"  Without any evidence to support your claim, this statement is little more than an ad hominem  argument.  Mind you, I don't mean this as a personal attack.  I'm merely pointing out the intellectual dishonesty behind condemning Christianity in this fashion. It would make much more sense if you could prove that all Christians do  base their belief on empty nothings, and that they do ignore all evidence to  the contrary.  Only then can you expect your attack to make sense.  \",\"I have the following items for sale.   Buyer pays the shipping costs.   Hardware is new and unused unless marked otherwise.

The Israeli  secret service,        Mossad,  is   reported  to  have   acquired  significant        information in connection  with the camps set  up in the        Troodos  mountains   in  Cyprus  for  the   training  of        militants of the PKK and ASALA {Armenian Secret Army for        the Liberation  of Armenia}. According to  sources close        to Mossad, about 700 Kurdish, Greek Cypriot and Armenian        militants  are   undergoing  training  in   the  Troodos        mountains in  southern Cyprus.  The same  sources stated        that Abu  Nidal's special  advisers are  giving military        training to  the PKK and  ASALA militants in  the camps.        They added that the  militants leave southern Cyprus for        Libya, Lebanon, Syria, Greece  and Iran after completing        their training.  Mossad has established that  due to the        clashes  which were  taking  place  among the  terrorist        groups based  in Syria, the PKK  and ASALA organisations        moved to  the Greek Cypriot  part of Cyprus,  where they        would  be  more  comfortable. They  also  transferred  a        number of  their camps in  northern Syria to the Troodos        mountains.         Mossad  revealed that  the  Armenian National  Movement,        which is known as the MNA, has opened liaison offices in        Nicosia, Athens and  Tripoli in order to  meet the needs        of the  camps. The offices are used to provide  material        support for the  Armenian  camps. Meanwhile, the  leader        of the  Popular Front for  the Liberation of  Palestine,        George  Habash, is  reported  to  have ordered  his  men        not  to   participate  in  the  operations  carried  out        by  the  PKK &  ASALA, which  he  described  as \\\"extreme        racist,  extreme  nationalist  and   fascist.\\\"  Reliable        sources have said that  Habash believed that  the recent        operations carried  out by the PKK  militants  show that        organisation  to  be a  band  of  irregulars  engaged in        extreme  nationalist  operations.  They  added  that  he        instructed  his militants  to sever their links with the        PKK  and avoid clashing with it. It has been established        that George Habash  expelled ASALA  militants  from  his        camp  after ASALA's  connections  with  drug trafficking        were exposed.

They said the contacts were verified in what were termed hard intelligence reports.  Abu Nidal leads the Palestinian splinter group Al Fatah  Revolutionary Council, implicated in the 1985 airport  bombings at Rome and Vienna that contributed to the Reagan  Administration's decision to bomb Tripoli, Libya, last year.  In Washington, State Department officials said that when Administration officials learned about the contacts, the State Department drafted a strongly worded demarche. The officials also expressed unhappiness with Greece's dealings with ASALA, the Armenian Liberation Army, which has carried out terrorist acts against Turks....   Serdar Argic\",\" Why?

Then come the Prophets (all the Prophets, plus Joshua, Judges, 1&2 Samuel, 1&2 Kings) and the Writings (Psalms, Proverbs, Lamentations, Ruth, Esther, Ezra, Nehemiah, Ecclesiates, Song of Songs, 1&2 Chronicles, Job).  And the veracity of Isaiah, which you quoted to your Moslem friend is quite well known.  A complete manuscript exists that dates back to past 200 BC, and is kept in a Museum in Israel.  It was found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, which greatly enhanced our knowledge of the veracity of the Old Testament, as they date back to around the time of Christ, whereas before, the oldest complete manuscript in Hebrew was from around 900 AD.  Your Moslem friend is sorely mistaken, but understandably so.  If Jesus was crucified, and atoned for our sins, he must have been God, for only the death of God could atone for the sins of all humanity.  And as Isaiah predicts, the messiah will be called \\\"the mighty God.\\\"  And if he was God, then he must have rose, for as St. Paul wrote, it was not possible that death could hold him.  And if Jesus rose from the dead, your Moslem friend would have little reason to be a Moslem.  Which is why he denies the authenticity of the Old Testament.\",\" The FDA, I believe.

Whilst I have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some relevant books are listed in a companion article.  To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.  Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism.  So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine being.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it may not.  \\\"What is atheism?\\\"  Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is often referred to as the \\\"weak atheist\\\" position, and the latter as \\\"strong atheism\\\".  It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \\\"Weak atheism\\\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \\\"Strong atheism\\\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \\\"strong atheists\\\".  Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making flat-out denials.  \\\"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?\\\"  Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not.  Which brings us to agnosticism.  \\\"What is agnosticism then?\\\"  The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed (\\\"strong\\\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable.  Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether God exists.  Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people use agnosticism to mean \\\"weak atheism\\\", and use the word \\\"atheism\\\" only when referring to \\\"strong atheism\\\".  Beware also that because the word \\\"atheist\\\" has so many shades of meaning, it is very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for sure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe.  \\\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\\\"  There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.  Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that such a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they see no evidence that God exists.  \\\"But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\\\"  There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects obeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly well-defined is a matter for debate.  However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of God.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.  If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest primes, because we can prove that they don't exist.  Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of the time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.  To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be tested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to prove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by default that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.  Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God exists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be possible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious book does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described by any present-day religion exists.  In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of God are not really applicable.  \\\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\\\"  If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction must be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable.  If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue that if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no importance whether he exists or not.  If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites. Surely he should still be detectable today?  Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically verifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him from all the other things that don't exist?  \\\"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but  isn't it still a religious belief?\\\"  One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \\\"the redefinition game\\\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:  Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out that it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He then records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to it, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \\\"agreed fact\\\", but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.  The point of this digression is that the answer to the question \\\"Isn't atheism a religious belief?\\\" depends crucially upon what is meant by \\\"religious\\\".  \\\"Religion\\\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and worship.  [ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not   \\\"religion\\\" according to such a definition. ]  Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of \\\"religious\\\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \\\"religious\\\" as well -- such as science, politics, and watching TV.  \\\"OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is  still just an act of faith, like religion is?\\\"  Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in.  Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt.  Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are the sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called \\\"acts of faith\\\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.  Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something. According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is \\\"certain\\\".  This is not a general tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists.  Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof. Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism has no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or the lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.  \\\"If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?\\\"  It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \\\"for\\\" or \\\"against\\\", \\\"friend\\\" or \\\"enemy\\\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.  Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense, it can be said to be \\\"anti-religion\\\".  However, when religious believers speak of atheists being \\\"anti-religious\\\" they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.  This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair. Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.  Most atheists take a \\\"live and let live\\\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they will not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of course, this may be in part because atheism is not \\\"socially acceptable\\\" in many countries.  A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \\\"convert\\\" others when possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.  (To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished.  The institution of \\\"state atheism\\\" came about when Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population.)  Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example, the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate.  \\\"But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,  surely that's the same as state atheism?\\\"  The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of another, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in nature.  Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For example, religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters, and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say.  \\\"What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people  pray?\\\"  Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things that those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in schools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they need not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event.  Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other motives.  \\\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about  atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't  atheists object to the religious charities?\\\"  There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for the sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis.  Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in connection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday matter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say self-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs.  To \\\"weak\\\" atheists, building a hospital to say \\\"I do not believe in God\\\" is a rather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say \\\"Today is not my birthday\\\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.  \\\"You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against  one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?\\\"  Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists.  It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the other hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others.  On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently.  \\\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\\\"  They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.  Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a Verdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts, they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy of the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!  Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance.  \\\"Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?\\\"  That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course atheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when one talks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\\\"right\\\") and unacceptable (\\\"wrong\\\") behaviour within society.  Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must co-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from \\\"anti-social\\\" or \\\"immoral\\\" behaviour, purely for the purposes of self-preservation.  Many atheists behave in a \\\"moral\\\" or \\\"compassionate\\\" way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care what happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.  Naturally, there are some people who behave \\\"immorally\\\" and try to use atheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who behave \\\"immorally\\\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions.  For example:    \\\"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ    came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was    shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited    patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive    eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,    be honor and glory forever and ever.\\\"  The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a religious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?     A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior    deteriorated after \\\"born again\\\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents    said they had driven intoxicated before being \\\"born again,\\\" 12% had done    so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before    conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex    before salvation; 5% after.                                 [\\\"Freethought Today\\\", September 1991, p. 12.]  So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour.  \\\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\\\"  If you mean \\\"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\\\", then the answer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people.  If you mean \\\"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\\\", then the answer is no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \\\"moral rules\\\" as theists, but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by humans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.  \\\"Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?\\\"  A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them.  Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are unbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.  This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that individual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only choice that person can honestly make.  \\\"But don't atheists want to believe in God?\\\"  Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many of them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the \\\"Big Brother\\\" figure might be.  Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of such an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.  \\\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are  unwilling in their souls to see!\\\"  Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained above, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God exists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.  Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded. Comments such as \\\"Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly\\\" are likely to be viewed as patronizing.  Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is futile.  \\\"Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\\\"  Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives meaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives count, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other people who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.  It is a natural human tendency to look for \\\"meaning\\\" or \\\"purpose\\\" in random events.  However, it is by no means obvious that \\\"life\\\" is the sort of thing that has a \\\"meaning\\\".  To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \\\"What is the meaning of life?\\\" is as silly as asking \\\"What is the meaning of a cup of coffee?\\\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.  \\\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\\\"  There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets. Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.  That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so what?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?  In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just hard luck.  \\\"Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\\\"  The short answer is \\\"No, do you?\\\"  Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.  Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of the existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.  \\\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments  apply?\\\"  No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is the sceptical \\\"default position\\\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism is a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.  Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers, but to everyone else.  \\\"What sort of harm?\\\"  Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings; think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on. Imagine how that effort could be better spent.  Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances of ill people being \\\"healed\\\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.  It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- and condoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many third-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.  Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion.  \\\"Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some  sort of excuse.\\\"  What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hard to tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all convinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight and kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REAL Christian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like the Catholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?  In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who calls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his actions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians are just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if the Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't be much of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he have made it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs aren't a perversion of what your God intended?  If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so? Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a Christian.  \\\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since  nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely  that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\\\"  That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue, positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns don't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.  It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \\\"weak\\\" atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still.  \\\"Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?\\\"  Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \\\"correct\\\" it is, or whether it \\\"works\\\"; consider how many people believe in astrology, graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.  Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.  Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world, we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other purposes as well.  \\\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say  something?\\\"  Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's worth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of concept of God in the Christian sense.  Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.  \\\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded  that God exists?\\\"  For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who does not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders.  A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.  \\\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates  nothing?\\\"  Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far.  The theory of memetics talks of \\\"memes\\\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure to keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes.  Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it.  \\\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important  messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\\\"  There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a few of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions.     There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.     Be especially sceptical of positive claims.     If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to    find it.     Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.     Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.     It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change    yourself.     Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.     If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.     Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.  and finally (and most importantly):     All beliefs should be open to question.

The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basically modified graphics chips and PIA's for the joysticks. Later model 2600 might have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI, as the weight of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.  Additionally, I think the 2600 used 2K, 4K, and up to 8K of ROM for their games. I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but I would hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. Think comes from a lot of hacking with the 800 and 130xe computers. And occasionally hacking with the 2600 (fixing it for monitor composite video use, and audio hookups). Also I tryed to make a cartridge-less system that stored the ROM into a RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time (a way to backup cartridges). I've heard of a setup like this where games could be bought (cheaply) on FSK-recorded tapes, then you would load them into a special RAM cartidge, and play them.  Anyways, if you're interested in looking for 2600 equipment, we've got two 2600 machines around (one composite A/V modified), and lotsa cartridges.

This is not to say that people in Illinois don't carry concealed weapons illegaly but practicing like that when there are other people around wasn't too bright of an idea.   I agree.      If you don't practice at all and carry a gun for self-defense you most likely would be in big trouble if a situation were to arise.\",\"I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population.  It is rather a ridiculous question in some ways, I know, but my newsreader is down so I am not getting any new postings for a bit, so I figure I might as well post something new myself.  Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core, than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it expresses its own selfishness.  Idle thoughts...   Adam\",\" I *think* this is correct behavior.  Remember the default colormapFocusPolicy is keyboard (meaning the cmap focus follows the keyboard focus).  Since the dialog is modal, mwm won't allow keyboard focus onto your main shell, and so it won't allow cmap focus either.  Since it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicy:pointer, I suggest you set colormapFocusPolicy:pointer also.  That way, the cmap focus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus, but will beat its own path.  (if you have keyboardFocusPolicy: explicit, you can set cmap focus explicit also, but you then need a binding to f.focus_color, probably on MB1).\",\"Hello , I think you are probaly right, in spite of the movement it is getting better each day.  cheers\",\"I recently read here that Sun has a patch for xdm on Solaris2.1.

I think depression is more likely to come from emotional problems (relationships, family, job, friends) and promiscuity is used as an escape.

The FBI and the BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their stupidity and lies.      Now before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as  a bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.  They told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet,  whoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into town on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and  wondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers. First, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they didn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got it.  After the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were coming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that. Well, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.  Did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to them they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised Koresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                   The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he  \\\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out. His grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise David Koresh.\\\"  Someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a logical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.  Here's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that they feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must be done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?  I knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how much money this was costing.  That was the start of the \\\"Justification\\\" part part of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.  But, back to the plan.  It is considered \\\"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\\\" to execute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.  They knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not sure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the  compound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.  I spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR (Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training is going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were subjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical  agent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.  I have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of thing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.  We waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these people 51 days.    I stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole thing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks changed my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:  \\\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the operation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal shot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\\\"  It took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.  One more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic weapons on the premises.

You implied that anyone who wants to send troops to Bosnia wants to do so to help the \\\"butchers of their choice\\\".  Since the primary targets of help are Muslim victims of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", you imply that such Muslim victims are butchers.   This implies both sides are equal.  True, it may sometimes be difficult or impossible to determine which side is the victim, but that does not mean that victims do not exist.  Would you, in WWII have said that there were atrocities on the sides of both the Jews and the Germans?   Yes, but both sides want different things.  The Muslims chiefly want to not be \\\"ethnic cleansed\\\".  The Serbians want to \\\"ethnic cleanse\\\" the Muslims.  It is indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants, but the things that the two sides want are not equivalent.   I recall, before we did anything for Somalia, (apparent) left-wingers saying that the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to Somalia was because the Somalis are third-worlders who Americans consider unworthy of help.  They suddenly shut up when the US decided to send troops to the opposite place than that predicted by the theory.  For that matter, this theory of yours suggests that Americans should want to help the Serbs.  After all, they're Christian, and the Muslims are not.  If the desire to intervene in Bosnia is based on racism against people that are less like us, why does everyone _want_ to help the side that _is_ less like us?

This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since, as you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.  Another way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you lose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter to replace the lost power.  The problem here is the switchover time and you've got to resync the AC in no time flat.  Unfortunately, most everything is built around the assumption that AC is available, so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to be usable...ya sorta have to make it work with what there already.

The threats, in Arabic, demanded that the delegates not go to Washington to, \\\"sell out the Palestinian people.\\\" One caller threatened, \\\"Should you go, you will not find your family alive upon your return.\\\" The newspaper states that such phone calls were received, as far as is known, at the houses of Faisal al-Husseini, Hanan Ashrawi and others. \",\" (WEBSTER:  myth:  \\\"a traditional or legendary story...            ...a belief...whose truth is accepted uncritically.\\\")  How does that qualify? Indeed, it's almost oxymoronic...a rather amusing instance. I've found that most atheists hold almost no atheist-views as \\\"accepted uncritically,\\\" especially the few that are legend. Many are trying to explain basic truths, as myths do, but they don't meet the other criterions. Also...   You accuse him of referencing mythology, then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology.  (This time meeting all the requirements of myth.)   Ah, but not everyone \\\"knows\\\" that god exists.  So you have a fallacy.   And that makes it true?  Holding with the Bible rules out controversy? Read the FAQ.  If you've read it, you missed something, so re-read. (Not a bad suggestion for anyone...I re-read it just before this.)   ...should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting it across?  You may trust the Bible, but your trusting it doesn't make it any more credible to me.  If the Bible says that everyone knows, that's clearly reason to doubt the Bible, because not everyone \\\"knows\\\" your alleged god's alleged existance.   1) No, they don't have to ignore the Bible.  The Bible is far from universally accepted.  The Bible is NOT a proof of god; it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god.  (Or does it prove even that?  They might have been writing it as series of fiction short-stories.  As in the case of Dionetics.)  Assuming the writers believed it, the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it. And that's ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and Biblical-philosophers were correct.  2) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible.  3) Again, read the FAQ.   Bzzt...wrong answer! Gravity is directly THERE.  It doesn't stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it.  God, on the other hand, doesn't generally show up in the supermarket, except on the tabloids.  God doesn't exert a rationally undeniable influence. Gravity is obvious; gods aren't.   No, human reason hasn't always come back to the existance of \\\"God\\\"; it has usually come back to the existance of \\\"god\\\". In other words, it doesn't generally come back to the xtian god, it comes back to whether there is any god.  And, in much of oriental philosophic history, it generally doesn't pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there.  From a world-wide view, human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be and/or what force(s) are currently in control.  A natural tendancy to believe in \\\"God\\\" only exists in religious wishful thinking.   Xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions, and it's reasonableness certainly doesn't merit eminence. Divine justice...well, it only seems just to those who already believe in the divinity. First, not all atheists believe the same things about human nature. Second, whether most atheists are correct or not, YOU certainly are not correct on human nature.  You are, at the least, basing your views on a completely eurocentric approach.  Try looking at the outside world as well when you attempt to sum up all of humanity.\",\" Every bit as fast as a dirtbike, in the right terrain.

(Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander         of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War,         Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov)  \\\"The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the  liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the  allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of  the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian  was permitted to approach the city and its environs.   While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained  in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the  area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to   attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the  plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder  of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by  the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers  who had remained in the rear during the war.   One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of  soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of  seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,  and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud  and dirt...   It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and  traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds  and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night  patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The   Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear  also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the  trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for  fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder  and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.   Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir  Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander  in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.  The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals  that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its  highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half  of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.   ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,  Odishelidge. They were as follows:   The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the  act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...  More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been  killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless   Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the  murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood   near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:  'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten  more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when  the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.   The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently  fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.  Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw  towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew  to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and  destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.   During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages  that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the   Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers  were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time  when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill  the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries  of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the   Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would  have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from  acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with  hatred and loathing.   Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that  he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The  Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the  stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since  the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed  in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen  of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping  him with the iron heel of his boot.   Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape  from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off  by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered  children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village  of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:   There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.  Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and  spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about  25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140   centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,  children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of  rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.   A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators  for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov  to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be   proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's  disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,  instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely  reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told  the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more  licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent  and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity  and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,  the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and  claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.   An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command  narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:   The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut  out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.  The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men   of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they  took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people  among this group were able to save their lives as the result of  my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were   released when they learnt that I understood what was going on.   Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the  Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered  on the streets.   On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent  Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were  threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for  murdering an innocent Turk.    When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would   be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare  you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the   Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard  that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within  the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same   day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to  him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible  act. However no result was achieved.   In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a  natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived  the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the   Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had  been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular.   The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed  one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached  three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details  of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers  were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even  withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred  people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading  Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.  However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with  the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower  classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders  of the leading Armenian figures and commanders.    I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals  were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who  opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that  it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.  Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian  cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have  supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred  to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by  the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.  You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a  conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear  of the Turkish soldiers.\\\"   Serdar Argic\",\"Hi all News Group users: Does anyone know whether there is some software which will let one do Text to Speach like the Sound Blaster does?

If it's a choice between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is only one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first.  Second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent.  Third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social beasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are two types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which dominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible. But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh rapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!  Now, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a game, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one; when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of interception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to react to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of.  With a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures may be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important -- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the road, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up newspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The larger the dog, the greater your anger.  Dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he are not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.  Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped punishment.\",\" I told a newbie friend of mine, who was having trouble from the complicated explanations of his rider course, to think of using the handlebars to lean, not to turn.

Larson's comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the \\\"Reciprocal System\\\", is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) \\\"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\\\"                      (2) \\\"The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\\\"                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called \\\"UNIT VELOCITY\\\" and \\\"THE NATURAL            DATUM\\\").                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.

Some of the early            books are out of print now, but still available through            inter-library loan.                      \\\"The Structure of the Physical Universe\\\" (1959)                      \\\"The Case AGAINST the Nuclear Atom\\\" (1963)                     \\\"Beyond Newton\\\" (1964)                      \\\"New Light on Space and Time\\\" (1965)                      \\\"Quasars and Pulsars\\\" (1971)                      \\\"NOTHING BUT MOTION\\\" (1979)                      [A $9.50 SUBSTITUTE for the $8.3 BILLION \\\"Super                                                              Collider\\\".]                      [The last four chapters EXPLAIN chemical bonding.]                 \\\"The Neglected Facts of Science\\\" (1982)                       \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\" (1984)                     [FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL astrophysical                                                             mysteries.]                        \\\"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\\\" (1988)                 All but the last of these books were published by North            Pacific Publishers, P.O. Box 13255, Portland, OR  97213, and            should be available via inter-library loan if your local            university or public library doesn't have each of them.                  Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available            from: The International Society of Unified Science (ISUS),            1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the            organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.             They have other related publications, including the quarterly            journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".                         Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson's lack of a fancy \\\"PH.D.\\\" degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a \\\"unified field theory\\\" that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      \\\"Modern physics\\\" does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that \\\"epicycles\\\", \\\"crystal spheres\\\",            \\\"geocentricity\\\", \\\"flat earth theory\\\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larson's organization, \\\"THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\\\", and Editor of            their quarterly Journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   \\\"Super Collider\\\" BOONDOGGLE!                           I am AGAINST contruction of the \\\"Superconducting Super            Collider\\\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS            WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \\\"scientific\\\"            value.                      Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (\\\"mesons\\\", \\\"hyperons\\\", ALLEGED \\\"quarks\\\", etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!                            Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of \\\"fire ants\\\" eating the insulation off underground            cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the \\\"Supercollider\\\"?!                                 Naming the \\\"Super Collider\\\" after Ronald Reagon, as            proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls \\\"Unit Velocity\\\" and the \\\"Natural Datum\\\".                       In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help \\\"prove\\\" Einstein's \\\"General Theory of Relativity\\\".                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \\\"General Relativity\\\" can, by            INSTEAD using \\\"SPECIAL Relativity\\\".  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \\\"General Relativity\\\" as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \\\"Special            Relativity\\\", including the parts about \\\"mass increases\\\" near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term \\\"COORDINATE TIME\\\" when writing            about this.]                            In regard to \\\"mass increases\\\", it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory,            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called \\\"Big Bang\\\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \\\"THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION\\\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific            Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456            pages, indexed, hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and            multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of            the \\\"3-degree\\\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-           ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white            dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theory's success:            In his first book in 1959, \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE\\\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from \\\"neutron stars\\\" in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the \\\"Cosmic Sector\\\".  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\"            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by \\\"fusion\\\".  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the \\\"MAIN SEQUENCE\\\" from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \\\"degenerate matter\\\", \\\"neutron            stars\\\", \\\"black holes\\\", etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \\\"mini\\\" white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bode's Law.                         \\\"Black Hole\\\" FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \\\"black            holes\\\" merging together into a SINGLE \\\"black hole\\\", and            concluded that the new \\\"black hole\\\" would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original \\\"black holes\\\".                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \\\"black            holes\\\", etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", it is            clear to me that \\\"black holes\\\" are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \\\"black            hole\\\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to \\\"prove\\\" their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical            problem somehow makes him \\\"wiser\\\".  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book \\\"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\\\", by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      \\\"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \\\"NOTHING BUT            MOTION\\\"] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\\\"                            Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the \\\"unit\\\" rate).             (\\\"Unit velocity\\\" is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \\\"above\\\" and            \\\"below\\\" labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)                        The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds.               SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in            his first book \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\\\".

Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                      Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY            discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,            in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles            of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses            at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and            elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

I got several responses referring to the Cobra Lock : (described below).  Has anyone come across a store carrying this lock : in the Chicago area? :  : Any other feedback from someone who has used this?  What about the new Yamaha \\\"Cyclelok\\\" ? From the photo in Motorcyclist, it looks the same hardened steel as a  Kryptonite U lock, except it folds in five places.

Anyone had any experience with them, how easy is it to attack the lock at the jointed sections ?\",\"Though some may argue about the nose of the camel, it's worth noting that the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony. If it is only used for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file encryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced standard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to easy-to-break inverters.  Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap. Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e-mail and files, let's focus on this.  One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.  Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal less threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have no secure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a \\\"goat\\\" can eavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones.  -------  Reading between the lines, I infer that the system is highly secure without access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanese security services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.  Most legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and would be delighted to have a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of depositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliable escrow. Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the week, and that system has worked pretty well.  From my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that need to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. But in return we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly skilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should be checked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn't have to be, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys pursuant to a legitimate court order. Thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries, while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order.  ------  In discussing this, let's try to avoid the nastiness, personal attacks and noise of some previous threads. This is a substantive and technical issue, and personal remarks have no place in such a discussion. \",\"Hi !

Several people responded with good information, but I don't think I communicated  exactly what I am looking for.  I'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a host via RS-232.  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and require about 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM).  In looking around, I see that lots of people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to be interfaced to your custom I/O devices.  It's been done so much, that it  would be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to use an 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then  transfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROM needs to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytes to/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS). Everything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much for this application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UART built-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.

However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the center.  (These measurements are statistical, and you can always hide a sufficiently small number of a different type of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming that there is only one population of GRBs).  The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center of the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets way beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing GRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to be released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.  If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy) you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of the Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center (for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if they are Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in radius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, the Earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.   The aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don't see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.   There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature.

Madness.  /* Written  4:34 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */ /* ---------- \\\"From Israeli press. Madness.\\\" ---------- */ FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.  Paper: Zman Tel Aviv (Tel Aviv's time). Friday local Tel Aviv's paper, affiliated with Maariv.  Date: 19 February 1993  Journalist: Guy Ehrlich  Subject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan (Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate within the occupied territories.  Excerpts from the article:  \\\"A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as Arabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is that everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one way or another insane\\\".  A man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name is known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be called Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to depart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different from average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service. But in their souls, one can notice something completely different....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them. And they think that to most of their fellows from the Cherry it woundn't be easy either. Yet after they began to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking. The following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness.  (...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in which some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We called such soldiers H.I. 'Hit by the Intifada'. Under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common phenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I should talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On Fridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to until I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The keys of my father's car must be ready for in advance, so that I can go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don't want them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it instantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only there I become normal.(...)  (...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother. It was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how exactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began to laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh straight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov cocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as they deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with the effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I was delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the Arab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit him straight in his ass. We both felt that we'd pulled off something.  Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab, blood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: 'Shut up' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed straight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at something convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: 'All right, wait a moment'. I left him in order to take a look at another wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be saved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all this to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight into my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt I was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over her head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn't know what to say.  (...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a field. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend shot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the hill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it. We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two deer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully inspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We had hit'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too, so as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like beasts of prey. We couldn't explain what had happened to us. We were almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we felt the whole day very badly.  (...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in. This is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may be for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel Godlike of sorts.\\\"  (...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any security-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. 'Why shouldn't I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ? Why shouldn't I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver while being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suits me perfectly. I have no human emotions any more. If I get a reasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to Bosnia in order to fight there.\\\"\",\"---------- cut here ---------- part 01/01 begin 644 1260wn31.exe M35KO 1D    & -$,__\\\\@ P $     ?#_'@     !0V]P>7)I9VAT(#$Y.#DM M,3DY,\\\"!02U=!4D4@26YC+B!!;&P@4FEG:'1S(%)E<V5R=F5D+@T*         M        _\\\"Z,#F\\\\$H0( C,N!PP (.\\\\-R RT !BT@ /J\\\\  *.T/LM00\\\"C<02.

They have a streak of meanness that runs much deeper and stronger than anything I ever experienced even during the height of the 60's racial struggles.  I am absolutely convinced that there are kids out there today that have no concept of right and wrong, but have the human intelligence which is turning them into the greatest predators that have ever walked the earth.  They will prevail unless the rest of humanity decides that it is in their best interest to stand up against these feral humans, and for individuals to start taking some responsibility for their own protection.  In a state in which the individuals turn to the authorities and police for protection, the police and government is soon composed of the very feral humans that they originally sought protection from.  Gee, I guess you touched my hot button.  I'd better go cool off somewhere.  \",\" The analogy does not depend on the premisses being true, because the  question under discussion is not truth but arrogance.   A similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood  transfusion is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are  Jehovah's Witnesses and so have conscientious objections to blood  transfusion. The doctor's efforts to persuade them to agree to a blood  transfusion could be perceived to be arrogant in precisely the same way as  Christians could be perceived to be arrogant.  The truth or otherwise of the belief that a blood transfusion is necessary  to save the life of the child is irrelevant here.

Thanks, \",\" Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (or some variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease had elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of them did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.  Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively swollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there's nothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include: psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most -- maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental toxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of these.  There's no outright cure at the moment, but different docs try different things, some of which seem to help.  Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days.

Some of the guys on the list you gave earlier never won one.  I agree that you and I could probably argue back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey- that is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better  than yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* original post (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not the coaching abilities.  Which leads to below:   I think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved here which transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for  us to say, \\\"He should hire a different coach.\\\"  In fact, he has talked about doing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so built up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to  prove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second round.  He needs to, as the papers say, \\\"get that monkey off his back.\\\" So it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're all a little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will improve as a result.  I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see how good of a GM he really is.   I may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussing it with you. \",\"According to a Software engineering professor here, what was actually rated level five was an ibm unit which produced part of the software for the shuttle, by not means all of it.

In fact, I could imagine how blocking a would-be passer would actually INCREASE your  chances of being \\\"offed\\\" or involved in an accident, especially if  this \\\"passer\\\" is riding your bumper.  Intentionally blocking a person riding your bumper is certainly NOT a \\\"wise driving practice\\\", it  only causes the jam to become more congested.

Lin  \",\" Then don't complain (maybe it wasn't you) that SCSI was so expensive on PC's because all we've had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus. (ie no one buys SCSI for ISA because ISA is slow) Are you saying that SCSI on an ISA bus is not an automatic winner when compared to IDE?   I get different transfer rates out of my IDE when I change my ISA bus speed.   IDE is just a variant of the old IBM- MFM AT controller.  (at least that's how it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different platforms.  Is there any argument that  IDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the drive is able to provide the data?  Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface (because of a higher RPM platter, different arrangement of heads, etc?)?   If data is going from one drive to another, and if SCSI has the ability to perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main memory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know, IDE can't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored in main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives  at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the same time?  Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA (or whatever) bus?   A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that's 245 million bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface, he gets close to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers?   So you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type, considering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or tape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and run DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives at the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years ago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice.   But on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you get more performance for the money.  For all the people that will only have a single hard drive in their system (regardless of the OS) will the SCSI choice really give them more performance than IDE?   True, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option is there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.   No argument.  This is always held up to the first time SCSI buyer as the best reason.  But how many SCSI devices will the first time SCSI buyer eventually acquire?  Again does it make sense to go SCSI for a single hard drive system?   With all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs, are you really sure that PC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible?  And even if they are,  is the data accessible from either machine (ie are there no formatting/ partitioning or file table differences?)  Is it really plug'n'play?   So the C: drive on the connor becomes a logical D: drive to DOS.  Is this really a problem?     After having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers, I have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor have I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or to/from the same drive.   That is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up).  I do believe that there is the possibility for up to 4 IDE drives on a PC. \",\"    The quick answer:  Revelation 12:7-9   \\\"And there was war in heaven.  Michael and his angels fought against  the dragon and his angels who fought back.  But he [the dragon] was  not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven.  The great  dragon was hurled down--that ancient serpent, called the devil and  Satan, who leads the whole world astray.  He was hurled down to the  earth, and his angels with him.\\\"   The earlier part of chapter 12 deals (very symbolically) with why  Satan rose up in battle against Michael and the good angels in the  first place.\",\"  What follows is my opinion. It is not asserted to be \\\"the truth\\\" so no flames, please.  It comes out of a background of 20 years as a senior corporate staff executive in two Fortune 50 companies.  I'd be happy to use a crypto system supplied by the NSA for business, if they told me it was more secure than DES, and in particular resistant to attempts by Japanese, French, and other competitive companies and governments to break.  I'd be happy to do so even with escrowed keys, provided I was happy about the bona fides of the escrow agencies (the Federal Reserve would certainly satisfy me, as would something set up by one of the big 8 accounting firms).  I'd trust the NSA or the President if they stated there were no trap doors--I'd be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined the thing under seal of secrecy and reported back that it was secure.  I'd trust something from the NSA long before I'd trust something from some Swiss or anybody Japanese.  This may seem surprising to some here, but I suggest most corporations would feel the same way. Most/many/some (pick one) corporations have an attitude that the NSA is part of our government and \\\"we support our government\\\", as one very famous CEO put it to me one day.

Sometimes.....  Depends on WHY it misfired....   I can't imagine doing much combat type shooting single action.....   Assuming the cylinder WILL rotate....   Never hurts to err on the side of safety, but if you've got one of those 'new fangled' hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties, it's unnecessarily redundant.  I'd rather have the extra round.   Quite true.  Speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around than magazines though.   True, but this is a training function.   Cocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions are the only carry modes that make sense...  The 80 series Colt's for example are quite safe to carry this way.   Agreed.  Now that I've shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It is true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  On the other hand, I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the years.  For example, I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had high primers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds to minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem. An auto?  Jack the slide and continue.  I've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from turning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen with a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.  Most revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  There are all sorts of close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a blow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many of the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto take a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely to malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight. The majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall into that category.  Vincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing view of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob's \\\"The Semi Auto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\\\"  In general, I'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self defense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination that is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi auto effectively as a self defense arm.  Most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department isn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on their own.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of training required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several times that of a revolver.  Many cops don't bother.  For myself, I'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  I'd rather pick what fits better with my personal inclination, what I'm wearing that day and so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!  That said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of buying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a Ruger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok too!)  If this post had gone the other way, I'd be arguing for revolvers. :-)\",\"Device........

We liberated Grenada  from the Cubans to protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion  of a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).   Vietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess  we \\\"invaded\\\" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have  invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles  for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from  Spain.  So if you mean by the word \\\"invaded\\\" some sort of military action where we cross someone's border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally \\\"invaded\\\" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation. (If some nation \\\"invades\\\" the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be invading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)

There seems to be some confusion between rednecks and white trash. The confusion is understandable, as there is substantial overlap between the two sets. Let me see if I can clarify:  Rednecks: Primarily use their backs instead of their minds to make a  living. Usually somewhat ignorant (by somebody's standards,  anyway) because they have never held education above basic  reading/writing/math skills to be that important to their  eventual vocation. Note I did not say stupid, just ignorant.  (They might be stupid, but then so are some high percentage  of any group).  White trash: \\\"White trash fit the stereotype referred to by the  word 'nigger' better than any black person I ever met, only  with the added 'bonus' that white trash are mean as hell.\\\"  -- my father. Genuinely lazy (not just out of work or under-  qualified), good-for-nothing, dishonest, white people who are  mean as snakes. The \\\"squeal like a pig\\\" boys in _Deliverance_  may or may not have been rednecks, but they were sure as hell  white trash.  White trash are assuredly intolerant of anything outside of their group or level of understanding. Rednecks may or may not be.\",\"Recently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive (a Seagate 210MB, I can look up the model number if it's important) and I've been trying to help him install it.  [I've got a vested interest, since my machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed.] He already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD (again, I forget the model number but I can find out.)  Anyway, I can't seem to get the bloody thing up.  I've managed to get one or the other drive up (with the other disconnected), but not both at the same time; whenever I try, the thing hangs during bootup - never gets past the system test.  The IDE controller's instruction sheet says it supports two drives; I think I've configured the CMOS correctly; the power's plugged in properly; I even learned about the master/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn't know PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpers properly (the 85MB one is the master, the new 210MB one is the slave).  The only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong.  I've tried several combinations:  controller - master - slave controller - slave - master master - controller - slave  None of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can't think of any others.  Another possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into two seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for \\\"C: drive\\\" and \\\"D: drive\\\" setup info rather than \\\"drive 1\\\" and \\\"drive 2\\\" like most others I've seen.  Could this be confusing things?  So, I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs, except for some info for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paper about the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it's one of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle, so it looks like a serial connection); now I be lost!  Many, many thanks in advance!  This is practically an emergency (I have two papers to do on this thing for Monday!)!

When graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft, presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft doesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes 'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational) envelope'.   Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are are the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilots do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this is done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans, such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed taxi tests).

As a provider of a public BBS service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee       intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS, if police comes       with sufficent authorisation ? I guessed this would be  a basic condition       for such systems. (I did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in Switzerland)  The US doesn't yet have many laws covering BBSs - they're not common carriers, they're not phone companies, they're just private machines or services operated by businesses.  There's no obligation to keep records. As Perry Metzger points out, if the police come with a search warrant, you have to let them see what the warrant demands, if it exists, and they generally can confiscate the equipment as \\\"evidence\\\" (which is not Constitutionally valid, but we're only beginning to develop court cases supporting us).  A court MAY be able to compel you to tell them information you know, such as the encryption password for the disk - there aren't any definitive cases yet, since it's a new situation, and there probably aren't laws specifically covering it. But the court can't force you to *know* the keys, and there are no laws preventing you from allowing your users to have their own keys for their own files without giving them to you.  Even in areas that do have established law, there is uncertainty. There was a guy in Idaho a few years ago who had his business records subpoenaed as evidence for taxes or some other business-restriction law, so he gave the court the records.  Which were in Hebrew. The US doesn't have laws forcing you to keep your records in English, and these were the originals of the records.  HE didn't speak Hebrew, and neither did anybody in the court organization.  Don't think they were able to do much about it.  It might be illegal for your BBS to deny access to potential customers based on race, religion, national origin, gender, or sexual preference; it probably hasn't been tested in court, but it seems like a plausible extension of anti-discrimination laws affecting other businesses.  \",\" But only in NY,NJ, Philadelphia, and Chicago.

While most   leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the    economy, there has been no corresponding improvement in the area   of jobs creation.    The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark.  last month,   in an effort to understand this problem, President Clinton appointed   a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting   economic signals.  This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore.    Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion.   \\\"It's the guns\\\" Vice President Gore said.  Apparently NRA members, and other   \\\"gun-nuts\\\" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the   economy out of the recession.  \\\"Their buying them five times faster than   ever before, and stockpiling left and right\\\", the Vice President said.      However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have   been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several   declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have   not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.    \\\"We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people\\\", said   the President of Colt industries.  \\\"As long as Clinton is in office, we   suspect it will\\\", he added.    In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new   Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It's    called the \\\"Ban-One-A-Month\\\" Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law,   every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index    cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw   one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any   further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the   politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.    The President said, \\\"This law will benefit America two ways.  When the   Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run   out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.  In addition,   over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the   street.\\\"  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee   this program, citing her \\\"Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject   of gun control\\\".    Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an   amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing   caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  \\\"Their stockpiling,   stockpiling, stockpiling\\\" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference   at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.    Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment   that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been   drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying, \\\"First we'll   fuck em, then we'll kick em out of bed in the morning\\\", during a press   conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate   building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow   the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require   the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,   after all of the cards have been drawn.    The head of the BATF responded by saying, \\\"We will have to see if this   thing in Waco is over by then.  We may be too busy to seize all those   guns\\\".    US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado   declared this proposed law as being \\\"reasonable gun control which won't   affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns\\\".    - end article -    For the humor impaired :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)                                   Bill Vojak                                 vojak@icebucket.stortek.com     NRA, ILA,                                 Colorado Firearms Coalition ------------------------------------------------------------ The CBS Nightly Propaganda With Dan Rather.

Just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing. You refer to      differing interpretations of \\\"create,\\\" and say that many Christians may      not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith      on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is      truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.       Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created      and eternally existent are equivalent, you say \\\"granted the Mormon      belief...\\\" You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to      have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address      and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the      conclusion that you grant.

When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a            liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)            And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of            the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease            to pervert the right ways of the Lord?

(John 1:13)            Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus           Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,           (Ephesians 1:5)            Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should           be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (James 1:18)            For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of           God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;           but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,           Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we           are the children of God: (Romans 8:14-16)            Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one           that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. (1 John 4:7)            Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and           every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is           begotten of him. (1 John 5:1)            For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.

I don't mean to be snotty about this, ra> but the fact is that the Bible is so differently interpreted by different ra> groups of Biblical scholars (what do you think of the Jehovah's ra> Witnesses, for example?) that to make reference to the \\\"Jesus of the ra> Bible\\\" is simply ridiculous.  Whose \\\"Jesus of the Bible\\\" do you mean?       This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but       rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read       something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches. For       example, the fact that the Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ       does not alter what the Bible teaches [ \\\"Looking for that blessed hope,      and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus      Christ;\\\" (Titus 2:13),\\\"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus      Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through      the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:\\\" (2 Peter 1:1)]       on the Deity of Christ.       We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not       even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that       have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches,       you have to look at the Bible.  ra> >     \\\"Our Lord's mortality was essential to his own salvation\\\" (_The ra> >     Promised Messiah_, p. 456), \\\"He had to work out his own salvation by ra> >     doing the will of the Father in all things\\\" (ibid., p.54), \\\"he had ra> >     to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom\\\" (_Mormon ra> >     Doctrine_, p.71). ra> ra>    Welcome to the wonderful world of Mormon paradoctrine, Robert.

The conclusions I come to may seem \\\"heretical\\\" to ra> you, but I'm prepared to accept that.       I find this rather curious. When I mentioned that the Mormon belief is      that Jesus needed to be saved, I put forward some quotes from the late      apostle, Bruce McConkie. The curious part is that no one addressed the      issue of `Jesus needing to be saved.' Rick comes the closest with his \\\"I      have my own conclusions\\\" to addressing the point.       Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of      Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't      think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the      issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this      subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may       certainly be. \",\"  This meaningless statement makes YOU look bad.  \",\"April 13, 1993 response by Al Moore (L629159@LMSC5.IS.LMSC.LOCKHEED.COM):  Basically the problem is that Israel may remain, or leave, the occupied  territories; it cannot do both, it cannot do neither. So far, Israe  continues to propose that they remain. The Palestinians propose that they  leave. Why should either change their view? It is worth pointing out that  the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a reduction in the Israeli presence. Israel proposes no such reduction.... and in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating. ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Tim:   There seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. The first is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, so there is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in  exchange for pieces of paper, \\\"expectations\\\", \\\"hopes\\\", etc. The second is that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand that these \\\"tangible concessions\\\" be made by Israel **without** it receiving anything **tangible** back.  Given this, the gap between the two stances seems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns for its expected concessions. By \\\"tangible\\\" is meant something that 1) provides Israel with \\\"comparable\\\" protection (from the land it is to  give up), 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine  **will be** accountable and held actively (not just \\\"diplomatically)  responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens  or \\\"visitors\\\").  In essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinian statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israel was assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to**  co-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel  from its territory.  Aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,  how *could* such \\\"guarantees\\\" be instilled? For example,  how could such \\\"guarantees\\\"/\\\"controls\\\" be added to the  Palestinian PISGA proposals?  Israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute it lets go (gives lands back to Arab states, no more \\\"buffer zone\\\", gives full autonomy to Palestinians), ANY and/or ALL of the Arab parties could (and *would*, if not \\\"controlled\\\" somehow) EASILY return to the  traditional anti-Israel position. The question then is HOW to *really* ensure that that will not happen.\",\"  Where did you hear this?  I seem to have missed it.   No.  Will L.A. burn?  No.  (Regardless of the verdict.)   Count your blessings.\",\"      The first means that some aspect of reality contains objective values. The second means that values are a reference to some preference of the individual.  In the first case, it is possible that some future discovery might invalidate certain views re what objective values are.  --\",\" Hmmm... Interesting. What do you mean by WALKING distance? I lived in Moscow for 21 years, and if I am 5 minutes walk to Belorusskaya subway station, I CANNOT be walking distance to Kremlin. Unless 1 hour of walking is what you mean.

Between 1914 and 1920, Armenians  committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all conceivable methods of  despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol over babies and burned  them, raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound  hand and foot, took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated  personal property and real estate. And today, they put Azeris in the most  unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history.                                  AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.  \\\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\\\" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. \\\"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive.\\\"  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  \\\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  \\\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother.  \\\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\\\" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \\\"We have never got any of the bodies back.\\\"  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  \\\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\\\" Mr Sadikov said. \\\"I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock.\\\"  Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

Thanks. \",\" Dorin, Let's not forget that the soldiers were killed not murdered. The distinction is not trivial. Murder happens to innocent people, not people whose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that these soldiers, in the line of duty, were killed by the opposition. And resistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munich were victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters). Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by resistance fighters. Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the hostile occupiers in WWII. Diplomacy has not worked with Israel and the Lebanese people are tired of being occupied! They are now turning to the only option they see as viable.

I can probably buy the  tools and this solution somewhere but I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO INJECTION BY MYSELF ! Can any kind people here tell me:  If it's possible to do it? Can I do it on my arm? or it must be done on the hip only??  Any info is welcome and please write me or post your help SOON!! (I am already taking the tablets ..and I can't wait!!)  Please don't flame me for posting this, and don't judge me.

With those reports about : Bosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that : the massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered : me was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I : shouldn't be so troubled about the reports of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" in : Bosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims. : Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians : who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing : God's work?  Perhaps it would be useful to ask whether those doing the ethnic cleansing could be said to be loving those they are killing in the very act of killing.  Does it reflect the attitude of God, who sends rain to both the just and the unjust?  If not, then Christians should be uncomfortable with it.  Jesus gave his followers the law of love to follow and it is by exhibiting this that disciples will be known.  Doctrinal (or political) correctness is not the standard, so I don't see why Christians should be moved against the Serbs because their ancestors converted from Christianity to Islam.  It seems to me that as a Christian you _should_ be troubled by the ethnic cleansing. -- \",\"Having read the posted long article by JPFO, I have some observations:  1.  This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a \\\"verbatim  translation\\\" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place -- the book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section by section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating. In the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce  the German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not  surprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a  single idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi law; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into,  urban-folklore style.  2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a  copy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution  team or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't  understand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable  to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and  yet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:  \\\"If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons Law during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of documents, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German law registry].\\\"  Bingo.  Exactly.    Dodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one under discussion.  All of the stuff about \\\"Why would a U.S. congressman have a copy of a Nazi law?\\\" melts away, by the author's admission.  He then continues:  \\\"But if he acquired the original German text of the  Nazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so  for a very specific reason...\\\"  But there's absolutely no reason to  think that this is the case.  In fact, as a \\\"senior member of the U.S.  team that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals\\\", it seems to me that he would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether  the Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously is, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally prosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red  herrings.  3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the JPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he  asked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge  levelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask  to have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd  took it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing  it into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*,  wouldn't he?     Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier posting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this purpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent on disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil liberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it on their own?     Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his own question: \\\"Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law to show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the  Nazi law.\\\"  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered into the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents \\\"concerning the history of Nazism and gun confiscation\\\", Dodd's motivation isn't a  mystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.  4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that was added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.   Registration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT a \\\"Nazi-inspired\\\" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the  1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification  of certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list  other parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews; of course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless, in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the  discussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues,  \\\"Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68...\\\" -- so  as to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.\",\"CDs for sale shipping is included  Barcelona Gold  Freddie Mercury, Tevin Campbell, En Vogue    INXS, Madonna, Eric Clapton, Sarah Brightman    ($9.00)  Wayne's World  Queen, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Alice Cooper    Eric Clapton    ($9.00)  Extreme II  Pronograffitti    ($9.00)  Saturday Night Live Band Live from New York    ($7.00)  Harry Connick, JR.

Fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government engaged in  disgusting cowardly massacres of Azeri women and children. I am really sorry if that fact bothers you.    More ridicule, I take it? Still not addressing the original points made.   Then what seems to be the problem? Did you ever read newspaper at all?   \\\"PAINFUL SEARCH ..\\\"  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \\\"Hojali Disaster\\\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \\\"We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\\\" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. \\\"We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.\\\"  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. \\\"Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\\\" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. \\\"This  is just a small percentage of the dead,\\\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. \\\"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.\\\"  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  \\\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\\\" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  \\\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.\\\"  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.  THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92   HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES  AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.  \\\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\\\" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. \\\"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive.\\\"  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  \\\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  \\\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother.  \\\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\\\" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \\\"We have never got any of the bodies back.\\\"  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  \\\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\\\" Mr Sadikov said. \\\"I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock.\\\"  Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

But lack of evidence for the existence  of something is in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something  (the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they  disprove evolution the establish creation). You (personally) have never  seen a neutrino before, but they exist. The \\\"pink unicorn\\\" analogy breaks down and is rather naive. I have a scientific theory that explains the  appearance of animal life - evolution. When I draw the conclusion that  \\\"pink unicorns\\\" don't exist because I haven't seen them, this conclusion has it's foundation in observation and theory. A \\\"pink unicorn\\\", if it did exist, would be qualitatively similar to other known entities. That is to say, since there is good evidence that all life on earth has evolved from \\\"more primitive\\\" ancestors these pink unicorns would share  a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such. God, however, has no such correspondence with anything (IMO). There is no physical frame work of observation to draw ANY conclusions FROM.      I disagree with you profoundly on this. I haven't defined God as existence - in fact, I haven't defined God. But this might be getting off the subject - although if you think it's relevant we can come back to it.    You are using wrong categories here - or perhaps you misunderstand what I'm saying. I'm making no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there is no fallacy. I'm not trying to convince you of anything. *I* Believe - and that rests upon Faith. And it is inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells you that they can logically prove God or that they have \\\"evidence\\\" or ..., then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).  BTW, an incomplete argument is not a fallacy - some things are not EVEN wrong.    I don't follow you here. Certainly one can make observations of things that they didn't know existed. I still maintain that one cannot use observation to infer that \\\"God does not exist\\\". Such a positive assertion requires a leap.       Once again you seem to completely misunderstand me. I have no EVIDENCE that \\\"'god is' is meaningful\\\" at ANY level. Maybe such a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of God down your throat. I, however, am not doing this. I am arguing one, and only one, thing - that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against requires a leap - it requires faith. I am, as you would say, a \\\"theist\\\"; however, there is a form of atheism that I can respect - but it must be founded upon honesty.     \",\"Are there any Honda groups out there?

I'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field. In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters, in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by  PANEL_MAX_VALUE!   As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h> contains the following bit:   /* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,   * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes   */  PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL = PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,    152),  PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH = PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,   182),  which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders. But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and returns value 0.

Only one blinker is used.  Note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the string 1 bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs in parallel with it.  That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing and the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open, this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the strings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.   Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get one.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these draw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.  What you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light  at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current  from the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing  both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a  low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow  at reduced brightness. \",\"it can   position.    now, but   please    I think the other replies sum up the fact that you can place a hard drive on its side.

Example:  The Appearances of Mary at Fatima, Portugal in 1917.   Among other things, she predicted the conversion of Russia to Atheism  (something that happened less than a year later w/ the Bolshevik  revolution).  She also predicted the second world war (that is, predicte predicted that it would occur during the papacy of a certain pope, who  was not the current one.  It happened just like she said.)   She warned there would be \\\"fire in the sky\\\" as a warning that the   second world war was about to start.  About a week before Germany  invaded, weathermen (and women, I suppose) all over Europe, from  England to Spain to Eastern Europe, reported the most spectacular  reddish color in the sky ever recorded.  To this day some try to   explain it off as the northern lights, and the relation to Mary's  prediction simply coincidence.  You all can decide for yourselves.   Mary predicted that the Atheistic Russia would spread her evils all  over the world and persecute religion.     She said many other things as well, too numerous to list here.  Every  single one has been realized.   One can only use the term \\\"coincidence\\\"  so many times in the same explanation before its use becomes   ridiculous.

Only by comparison to their offense, which is second in the league to Detroit.  But the Pens are no weaker on defense and goaltending than the Bruins are; that is, they are both very strong.  \",\"= = = = = =  The only thing about the 300ZX turbo and new Supra is they're about $10K or  more over his budget...\",\"]I wrote the slash two blues for a bit of humor which seems to be lacking ]in the MOA Owners News, when most of the stuff is \\\"I rode the the first ]day, I saw that, I rode there the second day, I saw this\\\"   I admit it was a surprise to find something interesting to read in  the most boring and worthless mag of all the ones I get.  ]any body out there know were the sense if humor went in people? ]I though I still had mine, but I dunno...

Thanks\",\"The ATF agent interviewed on \\\"Street Stories\\\" reported that the raid was ill planned, and went ahead even when they (the BD's) knew the ATF was  coming. WHY?  I believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it, and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part in the much larger political agenda of President Clinton. I would even  suggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the context of his political agenda. It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda,  as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. Further proof might be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requests for sufficient fire power.   Important dates:  Feb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban. Feb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked.      On Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon ban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senate in N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to have an Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons stated agenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or some group with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially at the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent  on \\\"Street Stories\\\" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to \\\"get  ready fast\\\", as \\\"they know we are coming\\\". I believe this attack continued,  even tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top  down. After the N.J. assembly vote, the ATF had a limited amount of time to come up with something, and the Wackos in Waco fit the bill nicely.\",\"]  Anyone who really believes that the Caps can beat   Let's be honest.

Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specifically the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats) will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user, and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed.  Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate with impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from key escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means.  Because life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal very large and conspicuous property (luxury cars), it is reasonable to assume that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous property (a cipher cellular phone).  Just as we have seen in the past with \\\"blue box\\\" technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones, we can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakes criminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stolen instruments.  Because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days, a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.  There will be a continuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies.  In other words, Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, and persistent threat to the general public.  On the other hand, if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a device in a mostly non-ciphered network, the communication will at least stand out as being unusual, and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation.  Finally, because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments, there will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communications in the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is discovered, and the instruments involved have been identified).  While recording and archiving may not be feasible for wireline networks, it is probably feasible across the more limited bandwidth of radio networks.  The existence of these recordings could open up vast potential for abuse.\",\" @===@                                                                     @===@  ###  Mark Juric                               A.I.

A1.  NEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE   * INQUIRY: Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage    by a man who infiltrated political groups  By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.  SAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world, Roy Bullock was a small-time art dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District.  In reality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40 years.  His code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal, and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) in her Washington, D.C., office.  For a time, Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White Aryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes.  From police sources he obtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people.  And he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government to trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills.  These are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a former Los Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with police and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide intelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League.  Officials of the Anti-Defamation League, while denying any improper activity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation.  They have refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz.  Transcripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents released by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory.  At times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air with laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like \\\"Ironsides\\\" and \\\"Flipper.\\\"  On one occasion, Gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a pro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa, Israel.  Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any ties to Israel, Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him.  Shortly afterward, another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed him.  The court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard, a former CIA agent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League.  Gerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the FBI, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker.  Its contents included passports, driver's licenses and identification cards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for four American embassies in Central America; and a collection of blank birth certificates, Army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies.  Also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, a black hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos of blindfolded and chained men.  Investigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the ADL confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of one target group, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee.  Each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony, San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant.  The Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civil rights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. The ADL's fact-finding division, headed by Irwinn Suall in New York, enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists.   However, evidence seized from Bullock's computer shows he kept files on at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Earth Island Institute, the United Farm Workers, Jews for Jesus, Mother Jones magazine, the Center for Investigative Reporting, the Bo Gritz for President Committee, the Asian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP.  The computer files also included information on several members of Congress, including Pelosi, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey from the Bay Area.  In their statements, Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation League has collected information on political activists in the Los Angeles area for more than 30 years.  They said they worked closely with three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who specialized in intelligence work, a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism expert and a San Diego County Sheriff's Department intelligence officer.  A spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation, and the San Diego Sheriff's Department declined comment.  Bullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama.  Although he is not Jewish, he began working undercover as a volunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party.  Bullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by the ADL as an intelligence operative, he told authorities.  In the mid-1970s, he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the West Coast.  To keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneled through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has never missed a payment in more than 32 years, Bullock said.  \\\"I was an investigator for the ADL.  I investigated any and all anti-democratic movements,\\\" Bullock said.  \\\". . . Officially, I'm only a contract worker with Bruce Hochman.  That way, the league would not be officially connected with me.\\\"  Bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists to Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own name but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink.  \\\"I'm one of a kind,\\\" he told police.  In recent years, however, his ADL affiliation has increasingly become known, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him.  In the mid-1980s, he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police.  In part because of this investigation, he became close friends with Gerard, who at the time was working in the San Francisco police intelligence division.  Bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups.  An FBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group:  \\\"Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, and would share the reports with Gerard.  Bullock also gave the trash to Gerard for Gerard to examine.  Gerard would later return the trash to Bullock.\\\"  From a wide range of sources, Bullock compiled files on 9,876 individuals and more than 950 political groups.  Gerard, whose files contained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people.  In 1987, Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the South African government.  Bullock tells of meetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100 bills.  Bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources. Once he rewrote an innocuous item published by San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African Bishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli -- and submitted it as his own work.  Bullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence.  Bullock said he split about $16,000 from the South African government evenly with Gerard, telling him at one point, \\\"I may be gay but I'm a straight arrow.\\\"  In his interviews with the police and FBI, Bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law.  For example, Bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records and criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer.  And he said Gerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence files on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy.  Bullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation of Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League's San Francisco office.  Bullock seemed proud of his \\\"Operation Eavesdrop,\\\" in which he used a paid informant, code-named Scumbag, to help tap into a White Aryan Resistance phone message network, listening to the messages left by members of the right-wing group.  \\\"For a short time, it was wonderful,\\\" he told police.  In Los Angeles, ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a \\\"fact-finder\\\" to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups.  Among other things, he told San Francisco authorities, the Los Angeles ADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had \\\"anti-Israel leanings\\\" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such sentiment.  Gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he attempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a rival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies.  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival and threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hate group.  Gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the probe, providing considerable information about the ADL operation.  Unlike Bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the investigation.  Gurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewed by The Times. Bullock's attorney said his client would not comment.\",\"Stolen from Pasadena between 4:30 and 6:30 pm on 4/15.  Blue and white Honda CBR900RR california plate KG CBR.

Around a million Americans every year defend themselves with firearms.  In many of these cases the defender doesn't even have to fire a shot!  The mere presence of a gun is oftentimes all the deterrent that is needed.  I don't like violence anymore than anyone else does.  But, taking away the right of Americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent crime problem in this country.  If honest, law-abiding citizens are unable to get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will be able to acquire guns through illegal channels.  Expect to start seeing the crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling guns.  Believe me this will happen.  There is *plenty* of economic incentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns should be banned by the Klintonistas.   Statistics, por favor?   See my previous post.  That ought to set you straight.   People have the right to keep and bear arms no matter what the Constitution says.  That means that even if the 2nd Amendment is repealed the *people* (that's all American citizens FYI) will *still* have the right to keep and bear arms.

I have a IIsi that came with a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.   First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum quarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them was stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a problem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for over two months.  The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal hard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard connector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare cable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found in any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of shorts or bad connections.  Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk ribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another male connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again, and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not damaged, and I can go back to the original setup.  Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this day.   In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of the drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are intact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal should be terminated at all the ends.

Xt Glossary ----------------------------------------------------------------------  o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code   to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with   this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,   RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,   etc.  The terms \\\"Xt\\\" and \\\"Intrinsics\\\" are used interchangeably,   however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X   window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,   Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the   Intrinsics are not especially useful.  o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The   precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It   is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the   Object class although these are more accurately called windowless   widgets or gadgets.  o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below   the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib   functions because Xt provides most such services although an   understanding of Xlib helps with problems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  In brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for critical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the appropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a list traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.  The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the interrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous to add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never be called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop about the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal. However, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.  Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.          Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4.  How do I use a different visual than the default? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has three things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and border pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap resource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions deals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen and DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is not properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is created.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends on the visual being used.    How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier because the basic information you need is available.  The first is a little harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the needed information.  /*  * Some sample code to start up an application using something other  * than the default visual.  *  * To compile:  * cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm  *  * To run:  * ./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow  *  * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap  * to install.  */  #include <X11/Intrinsic.h> #include <X11/StringDefs.h> #include <X11/Shell.h>  typedef struct {  Visual *visual;  int depth; } OptionsRec;  OptionsRec Options;  XtResource resources[] = {  {\\\"visual\\\", \\\"Visual\\\", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *),  XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL},  {\\\"depth\\\", \\\"Depth\\\", XtRInt, sizeof (int),  XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL}, };  XrmOptionDescRec Desc[] = {  {\\\"-visual\\\", \\\"*visual\\\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL},  {\\\"-depth\\\", \\\"*depth\\\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL} };    int main (argc, argv)  int  argc;  char  **argv; {  XtAppContext app;  /* the application context */  Widget  top;  /* toplevel widget */  Display  *dpy;  /* display */  char  **xargv; /* saved argument vector */  int  xargc;  /* saved argument count */  Colormap colormap; /* created colormap */  XVisualInfo vinfo;  /* template for find visual */  XVisualInfo *vinfo_list; /* returned list of visuals */  int  count;  /* number of matchs (only 1?) */  Arg  args[10];  Cardinal cnt;  char  *name = \\\"test\\\";  char  *class = \\\"Test\\\";   /*   * save the command line arguments   */   xargc = argc;  xargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *));  bcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));   /*   * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can   * retrieve the appropriate visual resource.   */  cnt = 0;  top = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv,           (String *) NULL, args, cnt);  dpy = XtDisplay (top);  cnt = 0;  XtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources,        XtNumber (resources),        args, cnt);  cnt = 0;  if (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top)))  {   XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt;   /*    * Now we create an appropriate colormap.

Which visual should an application use? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to be specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your application probably falls into the category of always using the default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular visual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some such).  Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server allocates resources I may not always want your application to run in TrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may be very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor or just monochrome.  As an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different possible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static color, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above  plus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that shell.  A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have its own realize method to use the visual when it calls XCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be obtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A reasonable value is probably XtNvisual.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This is interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen() and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e. it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.  If the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies colormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the visual.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This was especially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  See section 2.8 of the Xt specification.  It eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The Intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed. It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any pending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned up before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then performed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have completed, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the list is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among other things.  As some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the Intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the widgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs immediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not destroyed until returning to the outer event loop.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting an application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget may not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open sockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):    Widget  ToplevelGet (gw)   Widget  gw;  /* widget to find toplevel */  {   Widget  top;    for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))    /* empty */;   return (top);  }   void  ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)   Widget  gw;  /* widget */   XtPointer closure; /* data the app specified */   XtPointer call_data; /* widget specific data */  {   Widget  toplevel;    toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);   XtUnmapWidget (toplevel); /* make it disappear quickly */   XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);   exit (0);  }  One can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying the toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never occur.    This works for most widgets and most applications but will not work for those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant of the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the widget may change and someday require that some external state is cleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.  One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and difficult to maintain practices.  Try the following code instead.   #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>   extern Widget ToplevelGet (  #if NeedFunctionPrototypes   Widget  gw  #endif  );   extern Boolean ExitWorkProc (  #if NeedFunctionPrototypes   XtPointer closure  #endif  );   extern void ExitCallback (  #if NeedFunctionPrototypes   Widget  gw,   XtPointer closure,   XtPointer call_data  #endif  );   Widget  ToplevelGet (gw)  Widget  gw;  /* widget to find toplevel */  {   Widget  top;    for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))    /* empty */;   return (top);  }    void  ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)  Widget  gw;  /* widget */  XtPointer closure; /* data the app specified */  XtPointer call_data; /* widget specific data */  {   Widget  toplevel;    toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);   XtUnmapWidget (toplevel); /* make it disappear quickly */   XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);   XtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),       ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);  }   Boolean  ExitWorkProc (closure)   XtPointer closure;  {   exit (0);   /*NOTREACHED*/  }   ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the application is next idle -- which happens after all the events are processed and the destroy callbacks are executed.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. How do I resize a Shell widget? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  After it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper thing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget using XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the Shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the request.  However, the Shell must have the resource XtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the window manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.  To change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not the child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  It does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does not fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not block, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to block.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For a file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF -- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to be read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based OS's it is the poll() system call.  How to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use another process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe to connect the application with this other process and pass the file descriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on BSD systems is \\\"tail -f filename\\\".  It's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_ reliable.  In particular:   - IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while    (several thousand times) and then stop until some other    event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race    condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.   - Pyramid, doesn't work at all.   - Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as    sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing    side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it    all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at    a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks    (get raound it by detecting the situation and having    select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had    been given the whole block).   Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as read(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and may not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with part of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this point I don't know.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  I have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full details of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already familiar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may not find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, which means its a 1000 pages.  Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., \\\"X Window System Toolkit, The  Complete Programmer's Guide and Specification\\\", Digital Press,  1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by  Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC  Direct at 1-800-DIGITAL.  The other book I commonly recomend to novices is:  Young, Doug. \\\"The X Window System: Applications and Programming with  Xt (Motif Version),\\\" Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8).  (ISBN 0-13-972167-3)  And of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt. O'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt reference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively overhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding it very useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related information.  I read two periodicals, \\\"The X Resource\\\" and the \\\"The X Journal\\\". These are the only two dealing specifically with X.  \\\"The X Resource\\\" is published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being the MIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no advertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  For orders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorial matters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted at math.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in ~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.   \\\"The X Journal\\\" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising. The articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical audience.  I read it more to see what's going on then with an expectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a fairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty good collection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call (908) 563-9033.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 14. What Widgets are available? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  There are three popular widget sets:  Athena - The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most    purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is    available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z. Motif - From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on    many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but    Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think    it is poorly implemented. OLIT - The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets    implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by    AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.    I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.  In addition the following collection of widgets are also available:  Xtra - a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software    Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked    bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,    spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen    them so I can't comment. FWF - The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of    freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,    FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets    can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine    a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z. Xcu - The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the    early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for    buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so    widely used. Xs - The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but    seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise. Xw - The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written    for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.    Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.    The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was    originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided    much experience for the designers of Xt. Xo - A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you    can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*  The following specialized widgets are also available:  Tbl - Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif    widgets as children.  Part of Wcl. Plots - The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).    Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there? ----------------------------------------------------------------------   __________________________________________  Name  Language Vendor  __________________________________________  Xview  C  Sun  OI  C++  ParcPlace  Interviews C++  Stanford  Tcl/tk  C  sprite.berkeley.edu  __________________________________________   However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and implementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop in the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language other than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  First, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)  typdef struct  {       String name;      long value;  } Arg;  and the code:  Arg arg;   XtSetArg (arg, \\\"name\\\", 3.2)  expands to  Arg arg;   arg.name = \\\"name\\\";  arg.value = 3.2;  you can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value gets the integer \\\"3\\\" instead of the floating point value \\\"3.2\\\".  When the value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is wildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So, how to get around this?  The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now recomending it over the previous suggestions.  #define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\\\     if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\\\         XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\\\     } else { \\\\         XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\\\         XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\\\     }   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. How do I write a resource converter? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Courtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):  The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5) Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow for destructors and caching of converted values.  There are several main types of resource converters:      string to data type     data type to string     data type to data type  i) string to data type     Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings     that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often     used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:   Name  Value  \\\"True\\\"  1  \\\"False\\\"  0      In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare     the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most     readily accomplished by the use of the \\\"quark\\\" mechanism of the     resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,     which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a     single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the     quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.      If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many     converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then     a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the     resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of     these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks     and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one     of the converters.  ii) data type to string     This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data     type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,     the data type value is simply converted to a string value,     probably by the use of sprintf.      Data type to string converters are useful for applications that     wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that     they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This     mechanism can be used to provide a \\\"snapshot\\\" of application state     into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to     a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.      If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type     converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to     string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure     that they are consistent.  iii) data type to data type     This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type     value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be     converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for     red, green and blue.   The type signature for a resource converter is as follows:  typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,  XrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);     Display *dpy;     XrmValuePtr args;     Cardinal *num_args;     XrmValuePtr fromVal;     XrmValuePtr toVal;     XtPointer *converter_data;  When the converter is invoked, the \\\"fromVal\\\" argument points to the source X resource manager value and the \\\"toVal\\\" argument points to the destination X resource manager value.  The \\\"converter_data\\\" argument is an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified when the converter is registered.  The \\\"args\\\" and \\\"num_args\\\" arguments allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is invoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the Pixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.  Care must be taken with the \\\"toVal\\\" argument.  An XrmValue has the following type definition and specifies a size and location for a converted value:  typedef struct {     unsigned int    size;     caddr_t         addr; } XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;  When the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of the given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL. In the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the destination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If the destination area is not large enough, then the converter should set the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the converter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply copy the converted value into the space given and return True.  If the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to the address of a static variable containing the converted value and return True.  When writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it becomes convenient to define a macro:      #define DONE(var, type) \\\\       if (toVal->addr) \\\\  { \\\\    if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\\      { \\\\        toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\        return False; \\\\      } \\\\    else \\\\      *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\\  } \\\\       else \\\\  toVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\\\       toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\       return True;      #define DONESTR(str) \\\\       if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\\  { \\\\    toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\    return False; \\\\  } \\\\       else \\\\  toVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\\\       toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\       return True;  Inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety checking on the \\\"num_args\\\" and \\\"args\\\" arguments to ensure that your converter is being called properly.  Once you have written your converter, you need to register it with the Intrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.  To register a converter with a single application context, use XtAppSetTypeConverter:  void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,  cache, destructor)     XtAppContext context;     String from;     String to;     XtTypeConverter converter;     XtConvertArgList args;     Cardinal num_args;     XtCacheType cache;     XtDestructor destructor;  To register a converter with all application contexts, use XtSetTypeConverter:  void XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,  cache, destructor)     String from;     String to;     XtTypeConverter converter;     XtConvertArgList args;     Cardinal num_args;     XtCacheType cache;     XtDestructor destructor;  In the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and XtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter and XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be used.  When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a \\\"cache\\\" argument specifies how converted resource values are to be cached:      XtCacheNone  Don't cache any converted values     XtCacheAll  Cache all converted values     XtCacheByDisplay Cache converted values on a per display basis  Caching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a good idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).  The \\\"destructor\\\" argument is a routine that is invoked then the resource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is being destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:  typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,  XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);     XtAppContext context;     XrmValuePtr to;     XtPointer converter_data;     XrmValuePtr args;     Cardinal *num_args;  The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated with the \\\"to\\\" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed to by the \\\"to\\\" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the conversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments for the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to free the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private data passed in when the converter was registered.  Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT R5 distribution:      mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c     contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c     contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. How do I open multiple displays? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  See \\\"Multi-user Application Software Using Xt\\\", The X Resource, Issue 3, (Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues involved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a nutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_ application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display and remove it from the application context.  The real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can happen 3 ways:  1. User selects a \\\"quit\\\" button on one of the displays,  2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,  3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,     server shutdown/crash, or network failure.  I'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a problem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that display.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.  The third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the Oliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult problem.  The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O error is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true for a single display X based application, but not true for a multiple display program or an application that does things other than display information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the I/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit() happens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid returning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment demonstrates this:  #include <setjmp.h> jmp_buf XIOrecover;  void XIOHandler (dpy)  Display  *dpy; {  destroyDisplay (dpy);  longjmp (XIOrecover, 1); }  main () {  ...  if (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)   XSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);  XtAppMainLoop (app_context); }  The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go back to the application specific data and perform any necessary cleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().  For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is first called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the jmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to the same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value of this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to longjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this purpose it is adequate.  Some other problems you might run into are resource converters that improperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors such as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical value.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to connect to a display.  There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in November of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically said this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 19. What changed from R3 to R4 to R5? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This addresses only changes in the Intrinsics.  First, the general changes for each release are described.  Then a, certainly incomplete, list of new functions added and others that are now deprecated are listed.  Brevity is a primary goal.  Much of the following information is retrieved from Chapter 13 of the MIT Xt Intrinsics Manual and from O'Reilly Volume 5, 3rd edition.  From R3 to R4 - Addition of gadgets (windowless widgets) - New resource type converter interface to handle cacheing and   additional  data. - Variable argument list interface. - #define XtSpecificationRelease 4  (added with this release) - WMShellPart, TopLevelShellPart & TransientShellPart changed   incompatibly. - core.initialize, core.set_values added ArgList and count parameters - event handlers had continue_to_dispatch parameter added - core.set_values_almost specification changed. - core.compress_exposure changed to an enumerated data type from Boolean - core.class_inited changed to enumerated data type from Boolean - constraint.get_values_hook added to extension record - core.initialize_hook obsolete as info is passed to core.initialize - shell.root_geometry_manager added to extension record - core.set_values_hook obsolete as info is passed to core.set_values - Calling XtQueryGeometry() must store complete geometry. - Added UnrealizeCallback. - XtTranslateCoords() actually works under R4.  From R4 to R5: - Psuedo resource baseTranslation added. - Searching for app-default, and other files, made more flexible - customization resource added. - Per-screen resource database. - Support permanently allocated strings. - Permanetly allocated strings required for several class fields. - The args argument to XtAppInitialize, XtVaAppInitialize,   XtOpenDisplay, XtDisplayInitialize, and XtInitialize were changed   from Cardinal* to int* - Many performance improvements (this is summarized from the article   \\\"Xt Performance Improvements in Release 5\\\" by Gabe Beged-Dov in \\\"The   X Resource\\\", Issue 3):  - XrmStringToQuark() augmented with XrmPermStringToQuark() to    avoid string copies.  Several fields in the class record are    indicated as needing permanent strings.  - Using an array of Strings for resources  - Callback lists redesigned to use less memory  - Translation manager redesigned and rewritten so it takes    less memory, translation tables merges are faster, cache of    action bindings  - Keycode to Keysyms are cached.  - Better sharing of GC's with modifiable fields  - Window to Widget translation uses less space and faster  - Does not malloc space for widget name since quark is available  - Widget space is allocated to include the constraints  - Over several example programs, about a 26% reduction in    memory usage.

Where are the resources loaded from? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places (from highest priority to lowest priority):   1. Args passed at creation time.  2. Command line arguments.  3. User's per host defaults file  4. User's defaults file.  5. User's per application default file.  6. System wide per application default file.  Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result of steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.  The per host defaults file contains customizations for all applications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either specified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.  The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program \\\"xrdb\\\" is used to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the display must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is reasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER but most do not.  A user may have many per application default files containing customizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.  The system wide per application default files are typically found in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the fallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.  [Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]  You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.  Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located):   setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N  The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see XtResolvePathname()):   %N The value of the filename parameter, or the   application's class name.  %T The value of the file \\\"type\\\".  In this case, the   literal string \\\"app-defaults\\\"  %C customization resource (R5 only)  %S Suffix.  None for app-defaults.  %L Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \\\"ja_JP.EUC\\\")  %l Language part of %L  (e.g. \\\"ja\\\")  %t The territory part of the display's language string  %c The codeset part of the display's language string  Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is \\\"Myterm\\\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm  $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm  As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.  Let's consider another example. This time, let's set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.   setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N  The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,       for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is       defined so %T and %S are useless.  With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization resource value.  For example, you might run the \\\"myterm\\\" application like this:   myterm -xrm \\\"*customization: -color\\\"  If one of your pathname specifications had the value \\\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C\\\" then the expanded pathname would be \\\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\\\" because the %C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource.  The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:    /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N  (Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings.)  The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is     <root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   <root>/%L/%N:\\\\   <root>/%l/%N:\\\\   <root>/%N:  <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.  Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to \\\".\\\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \\\"./\\\", a dot followed by a slash.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. What order are callbacks executed in? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)  The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to modify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one currently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot guarantee the order of execution.  The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have; therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the list.  Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback    \\\"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the   procedure is to be appended.\\\"   you may not infer from the word \\\"appended\\\" that the callback routines are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback list.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 22. How do I know if a widget is visible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)   Right, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a \\\"deficiency\\\" in the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the protocol.  (The \\\"deficiency\\\" is that the information is available in one way, in this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section carefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.  A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from viewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped; that is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency. Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol; see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.   You'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.   As an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action routine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget which contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the map_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are suggestions.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  You can't.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc() tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is handled something like:   ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))  if (!ptr)  {   perror (\\\"malloc in xyzzy()\\\");   exit (1)  } To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions XtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which all use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and realloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.  In addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses XtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:   if (!ptr)   ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));  else   ptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));  ++count;  to be written as:   ptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);  Also, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I've found the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'm allocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so I can fully recover from not enough memory errors.  XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a structure or copying a string:     struct abc *xyzzy;    char      *ptr;    char      *str = \\\"abcdef\\\";     xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc); /* takes care of type casting */    ptr = XtNewString (str);  A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with malloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:    char       *ptr;    ptr = XtMalloc (100);   /* ... */   free (ptr);  may not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did this broken and complain to the vendor.  A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string when they should really be using XmStringFree().  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. How to debug an Xt application? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First, I'd recomend getting \\\"purify\\\" from Pure Software.  This is a great package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey at $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb (contact support@pure.com for more info).   Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into  the object code produced by existing compilers.  These  instructions check every memory read and write performed by  the program under test and detect several types of access  errors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past  malloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts  checking logic into all of the code in a program, including  third party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies  system call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory  usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel  adaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly  comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program  down typically by a factor of two to five.  An alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on many Unix's and has pretty similar features is \\\"The SENTINEL Debugging Environment\\\".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library functions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com for more info)  Next, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run in synchronous mode, easily accomplished with the \\\"-sync\\\" command line argument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then set a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the original Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous mode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to Xlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the server are asynchronous.  Next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the undocumented resource \\\"xtIdentifyWindows\\\" or the class resource \\\"XtDebug\\\" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window. For example:      example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &     example% xwininfo -tree       <click in new xload window>  will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each window is included.  This can help for checking the location and size of errant widgets.  Next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to test the way a widget manages it's children, you can try export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour of both.  It's a very clever idea.  The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from a pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to go to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands. Unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to your application which is stopped.  The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on your desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment) on one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly using a command sequence like this:   othermachine% xhost +thismachine  thismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;  thismachine% gdb application # Your favorite debugger.  or this:  othermachine% xhost +thismachine  thismachine% gdb application  (gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0  (gdb) run ...  I believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method of dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to release any grabs during breakpoints.  Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and knowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing the internals of a particular widget but not very far without understanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great deal.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work? ----------------------------------------------------------------------    I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,    XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when    I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.    I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works    perfect, but in my \\\"real\\\" application nothing happens.   The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those routines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is they use a default application context different then the one you may have created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per application context basis and you are using two application contexts, you won't get those events.  For example:   ...  cnt = 0;  toplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,        Desc, XtNumber (Desc),        &argc, argv,        Fallback, args, cnt);   XtAddTimeOut (...)  XtAddWorkProc (...)   XtAppMainLoop (app)  would never invoke the timeout.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)  Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an ``intuitive'' fashion.  Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has supported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with each other, and so far as I know, they are not published.  I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public protocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to support a \\\"standard\\\" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop and contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long as it is based on Xt).  The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM conventions, for more details read the code.  I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that it works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif anyway.  The latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from netcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.  A (possibly older) version is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib.\",\"I can't believe this, Howe has an ERA in the 80's He is improving!!!  \",\"Aryans who do not base their reasoning on Nazi ideology are racists...

Any leads would be most appreciated.  \",\" Flights of fancy, and other irrational approaches, are common.  The crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use unless they make you do some experiments.  I've known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit out loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.  (Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for Warren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created. Other species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me, Warren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)   I'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really working in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong, you will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_. If you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all in mind, you will probably get nowhere.   Unfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science: Lysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.   I don't agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at which I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing process.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.  Another point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental design''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_, not design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously been found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny nose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage was well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.   It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.\",\"Hi there,  I think it is time to create a MS DOS 6.0  FAQ since lots of questions about it are actually flooding the net.

Local law enforcement will be unable to perform a wiretap without bringing in federal agencies.   Based on the (possibly incomplete) understanding of the system quoted from D. Denning, only the FBI will be able to decrypt the system key encryption layer, which seems to be needed even to identify what escrowed keys to request.  This moves a great deal of law enforcement power to the federal level.  The reason I like this point is that it may sway or even persuade people who don't generally line up with the civil liberties crowd.

Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice      time per game and some measure of its \\\"quality\\\" (i.e., is the player put out      in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up      against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would      much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious      merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.  Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/- comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way play.  In my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the other hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get 90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.  (By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy floater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like overtime of playoff games). \",\"When sw is delivered you will often (always?)  get 360 k diskettes if you opt for the 5 1/4 inch format.

The right way to do communications security is to generate a random session key with Diffie Hellman, use it for a while and then destroy it. Once it's gone, there's no getting it back, and no way to decrypt recordings of the conversation.  To make sure you aren't being attacked by a man in the middle, you have to authenticate your DH exchanges. The AT&T secure phone does this by displaying the DH key so you can compare them verbally over the phone. This is nice and simple, but it relies on user awareness plus the inability of the man in the middle to duplicate the users' voices.  A better way is to authenticate the exchanges with RSA. Since you'd never use RSA for actual encryption, compromising your RSA secret key would only allow someone to impersonate you in a future conversation, and even that only until you revoke your public key.  They would still not be able to decrypt recordings of prior conversations for which the session keys have been destroyed.

Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least partially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly evaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released) The answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't.  There is other hardware out there not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.)  My suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper systems.  If not we're in trouble.  Given that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like to think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this. They know their initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never taken seriously.  The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You know little about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step in the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banning or SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the \\\"Clipper\\\" system is easily justified \\\"Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying to subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternative so use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever.\\\" How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system the only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can't, and the administration knows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for drug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.  Don't sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid. Either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations collective I.Q. is about that of a potato.  Why do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big, and NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it, noone will buy the stuff that doesn't have to.  AT&T must know this too, THINK MAN, why the hell would they jump the gun?   I really wonder.  To wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton:  The White House Office of the Press Secretary c/o: Presidential Comment Line (fax) (202) 456-2461   April 17, 1993   Sir and/or Madam:     I must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and cryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.   It is apparent to me that those who drafted the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \\\"Big Brother Proposal\\\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep      ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \\\"experts\\\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.   In addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \\\"tamper proof\\\" the key escrows might be.   I cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti      lize the \\\"Big Brother Chip.\\\"   Unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like \\\"harmony,\\\" \\\"right to encryption,\\\" and \\\"voluntary.\\\"   It mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is \\\"I can't believe it's happening here.\\\"  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; \\\"When is the Reichstag fire planned for?\\\"           Most Concerned,         [Signature]       Shaen Logan Bernhardt I uni@acs.bu.edu \",\" Preventing black market chips w/non-escrowed keys IS exactly what they mean by protecting the security of the key escrow system.

I have a lot of fonts that I can install either as Type-1 PostScript (under ATM) or as TrueType.  I have noticed that:      1. TrueType font files are at least 1/3 larger than their Type-1  equivalents.

With a 300 dpi laser printer, the \\\"artificial bold\\\" version of a  TrueType font is indistingishable from the original, forcing me to  install the actual bold (and bold-italic, etc.) variants if I want  to use them.  Type-1 PostScript fonts under ATM generate a visually  distinct bold variant from the base font.  I realize that the  artificial bold font that ATM generates is aesthetically inferior  to the hand-generated bold TrueType variant, but it is sufficient  for my needs, and not having to install bold variants saves me 50%  on disk space (uncompressed). \",\"Hi,   Being a Electronic Engineering Student with only Electronic II under my belt, I find myself *needing* to build a moderate wattage Audio Amp.

Good luck,  - Pete ____________________________________________________________________________\",\" Hi Adda,  Most Bible scholars agree that there was one copy of each book at a certain time -- the time when the author wrote it.  Unfortunately, like all works from this time period and earlier, all that exists today are copies.    There are parts of books, scraps really, that date from around the mid second century (A.D. 130+).  There are some complete books, letters, etc. from the middle third century.  The first complete collection of the New Testament dates from the early 4th century (A.D. 325).  Throughout this period are writings of various early church fathers/leaders who quoted various scriptures in their writings.   If you mean that someone discovered thousands of \\\"Bibles\\\" which were all perfect copies dating from the last part of the 1st century...No!  If you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts (within the dates given above, but not letter perfect) and that the most probable text can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest original autographs (now lost) probably were written starting sometime shortly after A.D. 50, then yes.   From the original authors.  We call them Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Peter, Paul, James, and one other not identified.   As long as you make it.   Regards,\",\" OK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.  We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is, is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of us who have bikes are familiar.  Let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its own, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to get rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches to transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to remain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike, through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the same way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along  a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change  surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact  patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It  probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice,  but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like  because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a  better way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch forces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface. You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it was the rotation that did it.  Looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple. Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them about the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels. How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not sideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski or skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels. I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like that, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect. Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try one of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very much like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn. So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's, a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have countersteering.  Conclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have motorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what real effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations of how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm  willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering.   If you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's behaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.\",\"  oh, i see. electricity is a natural right & our wonderful government would -never- cut off the power to the people they were besieging. are you really this dumb, or just acting like it for the sake of argument?  jason \",\" I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net. My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside the point. What does the Roman Catholic church say?  Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as provided for in canon law.  After all we Orthodox don't cinsider ourselves schismatic or excommunicated.

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD     On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National  Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D. Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.     OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier.

Nothing makes me gag more than people who don't respect the rights of others to voice their opinions.  My idol Lenny Bruce once commented about \\\"that asshole Time Magazine\\\" when they advocated censorship of his material.  Time actually sided with the cops' and their arresting of Bruce at his shows, whereby he routinely would say \\\"cocksucker\\\", then the cops would rush the stage to arrest him.  My, how the times haven't changed...  I can't help but think of how Lenny would be received in today's politically correct arena.  Heck, I even support the right of neo nazis to speak their opinions and march down the streets.  And before Mr. Frank or anyone else makes any wisecracks about anti-Semitism...I'm Jewish, a longtime member of AIPAC and the JNF, and have contributed over $1000 apiece to these fine groups.  I'm a regular contributor to every pro-Israel group I can find, but I still support the right of people like Arf to speak up and vomit his propaganda.  I want to know just WHO these people are !!!  I'm basing all this on the assumption that Mr. Frank did indeed write to some sysadmin requesting Mr. Teel to be admonished.  If this is not the case, I hereby retract these nasties directed toward him.  If not, I stand against Mr. Frank and his trashing of the First Amendment.\",\"Notwithstanding all the legitimate fuss about this proposal, how much of a change is it?  ATT's last product in this area (a) was priced over $1000, as I suspect 'clipper' phones will be; (b) came to the customer  with the key automatically preregistered with government authorities. Thus, aside from attempting to further legitimize and solidify the fed's posture, Clipper seems to be \\\"more of the same\\\", rather than a new direction.    Yes, technology will eventually drive the cost down and thereby promote more widespread use- but at present, the man on the street is not going to purchase a $1000 crypto telephone, especially when the guy on the other end probably doesn't have one anyway.

That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have made any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying that they are infallible.  Impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will probably agree.  In short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning, then those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved, there is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing \\\"There is no way out of the loop.\\\"   Someone called `REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but he did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase Sartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to relativism.  As I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false because you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because   However, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX' has written does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he does not like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it.   *  There were two sentences in `REXLEX's post that seemed relevant to the point at hand:   I do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  I have, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I don't claim to be infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I do claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.  However, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about them, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlier article.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted in very limited circumstances.    But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.  For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said, exactly, \\\"This is my body.\\\"  We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.  At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Why should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be fallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?  So, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is that Jesus said \\\"This is my body.\\\"  Beyond that, once we start making up doctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we get into trouble.  Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they cannot be certain.    That is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us know that human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do not believe we are infallible, any more than we do.  When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you are either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying to cover them up.  I think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what things we are only \\\"very confident\\\" of.  For example, we might say that we know our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  But other things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical thinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are very confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.  But, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting as if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous.   *  `REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by Francis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of it, but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebody else might like it, though, so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.  If someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On Certainty_, by Ludwig Wittgenstein. \",\"I am looking for a CDROM audio cable to connect my Toshiba 3401B (L/R audio) to the Pro Audio Spectrum 16 sound card.

How do I make a screendump or print my application?   The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window  or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window.  The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr  client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:   csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd & and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current display will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an undocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the  command-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for  specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]   Two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of  arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc. There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92] is the most recent.  xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders  XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr; see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z.  A screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information:  soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.  xprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.   To post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr, which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps and XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for  use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive servers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.   The XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and save it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.   Also:    Bristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter  2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net in vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.   ColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen- capture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and  non-PostScript printers.   Some vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows)  include session managers or other desktop programs which include \\\"print portion of screen\\\" or \\\"take a snapshot\\\" options. Some platforms also have tools which  can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example,  have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals  have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.   Some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct  support for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package  to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?   If you need color PostScript in particular, you can   - grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color  PostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv   - grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS. You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick  distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?   This can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider  instead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?   The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++  Portable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting  among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps,  gray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently; the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.  Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in  particular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary. It's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).   Useful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, a version of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are  later versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.   Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export;  see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.   xv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley),  can read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF,  GIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity,  contrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned  formats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on  it, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92;  see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.   The Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>. Conversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available via FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z,  and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.   The Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads and writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.   The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar  to PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*,  weedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.   Xim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential  interactive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is  a version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and  Motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif,  xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a library and command-line utilities for building your own applications.   ImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from  export's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display images on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF from other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.   xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining simple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems with building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com,10/90] xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.   A version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing tool is available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package  also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget. [12/91;5/92]   [some material from Larry Carroll (larryc@poe.jpl.nasa.gov), 5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  28)  How can I change the titlebar of my xterm window?   The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the string which appears in the window titlebar.  A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell:   echo \\\"ESC]2;TEXT^G\\\" where ESC is the escape key, TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed, and ^G is a Control-G (the BEL character).   Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to the current working directory when you change directories:   alias newcd 'cd \\\\!*; echo -n ESC]2\\\\;$cwd^G'   The digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should  change only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name  used in the icon, use the digit '0' instead, and use '1' to change only the  icon name.   Note: another way to do this, which prevents an incorrect display of the local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell, is to wrap the escape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself.   Note: on an IBM RS/6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with a ^V.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  29)  Where can I find the xterm control sequences?  The best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file  ctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z.  O'Reilly's Volume 3, the X User's Guide, includes an R5 version of the control  sequences; the standard volume will be available 3/93, and a Motif version of  the book is available now. The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version of the control sequences. [1/93]  Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that document and also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a  compilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100  sequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was  published in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).  In a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.  [last updated 10/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  30)- Why does the R3 xterm, et al, fail against the R4 server? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ?   In order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to  \\\"stty pass8\\\" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as   XTerm*font:  -*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1  XTerm*boldfont: -*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1 [The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]  In addition, you may want to set this in your shell:  setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1          For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with  the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using `man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (')  is Alt-'.

You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give  a resource specification like this:   xterm*geometry: 80x24 then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to 80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size.  But its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only the terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:   xterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?   You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command.  However, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for  manipulating the selection will help; e.g.   % xselection PRIMARY | lpr finds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a  window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of the selection and other properties. A version is on export.  Also available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be adapted to do this.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?   You can use several environment variables to control how resources are  loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and  XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for  application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.   Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a  way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies. Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also  have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could  set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up  app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located):  setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N  The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see  XtResolvePathname()):          %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the                 application's class name.         %T      The value of the file \\\"type\\\".  In this case, the                 literal string \\\"app-defaults\\\"         %C      customization resource (R5 only)         %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.         %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \\\"ja_JP.EUC\\\")         %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. \\\"ja\\\")         %t      The territory part of the display's language string         %c      The codeset part of the display's language string   Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is  \\\"Myterm\\\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the  example omits locale-specific lookup.)  /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm  $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm   As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above  app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it  and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to  search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.   Let's consider another example. This time, let's set  XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working  directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.  setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N   The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands  to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging  because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file  Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and %S are useless.   With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization  resource value.  For example, you might run the \\\"myterm\\\" application like this:  myterm -xrm \\\"*customization: -color\\\"   If one of your pathname specifications had the value \\\"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C\\\" then the expanded pathname would be \\\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\\\" because the %C substitution character  takes on the value of the customization resource.   The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:   /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\   /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N   (Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings.)   The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is    <root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)   <root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)   <root>/%L/%N:\\\\   <root>/%l/%N:\\\\   <root>/%N:   <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory  if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other  than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.   Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find  your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR  to \\\".\\\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3  compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \\\"./\\\", a dot followed  by a slash.  [Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?  The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a program to change the background before loading the resources; for example,  your /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line   DisplayManager.0.authorize: false  to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also   DisplayManager*xrdb: /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb where that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:  #!/bin/sh  #comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources  /usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap  /usr/bin/X11/xrdb $* Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.

You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script; or you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and source it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or, if you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your  .xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting your .xsession file off with \\\"#!/bin/csh\\\".   If this doesn't work, also try starting off with:   #!/bin/sh   # Reset path:   PATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?   There are several ways to avoid having to do a \\\"setenv DISPLAY ...\\\" whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X.  One solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It  includes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and xrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine. A more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.  One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from 132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and $DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then  propagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain   eval `xrlogind` where xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special  format it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to  recreate the environment variables. [11/90]   In addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on  another host, and you find   rsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY  too simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh  can be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be    xrsh <HOST> xterm    #! /bin/sh   # start an X11 process on another host   # Date: 8 Dec 88 06:29:34 GMT   # From: Chris Torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu>   # rsh $host -n \\\"setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null\\\"   #   # An improved version:   # rXcmd (suggested by John Robinson, jr@bbn.com)   #       (generalized for sh,ksh by Keith Boyer, keith@cis.ohio-state.edu)   #   # but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again.

One way is to use the \\\"bitmap\\\" client or some other bitmap-editor (e.g. Sun's icon-editor tool, post-processed with pbmplus) to design the individual  characters and then to do some large amount of post-processing to concatenate  them into the BDF format. See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X  Journal for more information.  The R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained  a number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.  An easier way is to use the \\\"xfed\\\" client to modify an existing font; a version is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is  available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63],  possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce BDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers.  The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors, XPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in /pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed  [5/91] in export:/contrib.   If you are a MetaFont user you can use \\\"mftobdf\\\" from the SeeTeX distribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe, a font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats.  The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these tools to modify a font.  Fonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is in ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?   After you have built the font using your system's font-compiler,  installed it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent (e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp  $dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the  directory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in that directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably  leaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in  the path.)  Sometimes your \\\"xset +fp $dir\\\" command fails with a BadValue error:   X Error of failed request:BadValue    (integer parameter out of range for operation)   Major opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)   This means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The mention of an \\\"integer parameter\\\" in the message is spurious.)  -- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file    system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your    font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an    xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. \\\"xset +fp ~/myfonts\\\") and    the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.  -- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server    (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file    \\\"fonts.dir\\\".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're    running OpenWindows, look for the file \\\"Families.list\\\".  If you can't find    it, run bldfamily(1).)  -- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a    proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for    example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.    Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for    Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work    for X11Rn.

A tool called \\\"snftobdf 1.4\\\" is part of the bdftools package, which is  available from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from  crl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.  [2/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  41)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format?   der Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and  produces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be  used as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can  understand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools  such as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail  from mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91]  In addition, the R5 program \\\"fstobdf\\\" can produce bdf for any font that the R5 server has access to.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server?   The DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation, but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to standard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file  contrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is  for a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for  creating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers  which do not use the MIT font scheme.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  43)  How do I add \\\".bdf\\\" fonts to my DECwindows server?   The format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the \\\".pcf\\\" format. You can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc font-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a performance hit.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?) I want to be able to do something like this:  xclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave   You can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the  same depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because  of this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since  there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore,  neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap  converter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a  resource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for  use in many of its widgets, however. [courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]  However:  A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of  the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick  (basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of  image formats as a pixmap.   The leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used  by Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by AT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM  distribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write  routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See information on the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is available from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on  the R5 contrib tape. [A set of XPM icons collected by Anthony Thyssen  (anthony@kurango.cit.gu.edu.au) is on export in contrib/AIcons.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  45)  Why can't I override translations? Only the first item works.   You probably have an extra space after the specification of the first  item, like this:  basic*text.translations:  #override \\\\  Ctrl<Key>a:    beginning-of-line() \\\\n\\\\    Ctrl<Key>e:    end-of-line()            ^ extra space The newline after that space is ending the translation definition. [Thanks to Timothy J. Horton, 5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  46)  How can I have xclock or oclock show different timezones?   One solution is xchron, in Volume 6 of comp.sources.x, which can show the time for timezones other than the local one.   Alternatively, you can probably set the timezone in the shell from which you invoke the xclock or oclock, or use a script similar to this:  #!/bin/sh  TZ=PST8PDT xclock -name \\\"San_Luis_Obispo_CA\\\" 2> /dev/null &  TZ=EST5EDT xclock -name \\\"King_Of_Prussia_PA\\\" 2> /dev/null &  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  47)  I have xmh, but it doesn't work. Where can I get MH?   The xmh mail-reader requires the Rand MH mail/message handling system, which is not part of the UNIX software distribution for many machines. A list  of various ftp, uucp, e-mail and US-mail sites for both xmh and MH is given in  the monthly MH FAQ; one source is ics.uci.edu in the file pub/mh/mh-6.7.tar.Z. If you do not receive the comp.mail.mh newsgroup or the MH-users mailing list,  you can request a copy of the FAQ, which also includes a section on xmh,  by sending mail to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu containing the request \\\"send usenet/news.answers/mh-faq\\\".  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  48)  Why am I suddenly unable to connect to my Sun X server? After a seemingly random amount of time after the X server has been started, no other clients are able to connect to it.   The default cron cleanup jobs supplied by Sun (for 4.0.3, at least) delete \\\"old\\\" (unreferenced) files from /tmp -- including /tmp/.X11-unix, which  contains the socket descriptor used by X. The solution is to add \\\"! -type s\\\" to the find exclusion in the cron job.

The R5 sample server implementation works only on color screens, sorry.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  50)! How do I get my Sun Type-[45] keyboard fully supported by Xsun?   Many users wants the Num Lock key to light the Num Lock LED and have the  appropriate effect on the numeric keypad. The Xsun server as distributed by MIT doesn't do this but there are two different patches available.   The first patch is written by Jonathan Lemon and fixes the Num Lock related  problems. It is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in the file contrib/Xsun-R5.numlock_patch.Z .   The second is written by Martin Forssen and fixes the Num Lock and Compose keys and adds support for the different national keyboard layouts for Type-4 and  Type-5 keyboards. This patch is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/sunkbd1216-0314.tar.Z or via email from maf@dtek.chalmers.se.   [thanks to Martin Forssen (maf@dtek.chalmers.se or maf@math.chalmers.se), 8/92]  A set of patches by William Bailey (dbgwab@arco.com) was posted to newsgroups 11/92 to provide support for the Type-5 keyboard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  51)  How do I report bugs in X?   Generally, report bugs you find to the organization that supplied you with the X Window System. If you received the R5 source distribution directly  from MIT, please read the file mit/bug-report for instructions. [Look in mit/doc/bugs/bug-report in R4.]  [Thanks to Stephen Gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu>, 5/91; 12/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  52)  Why do I get \\\"Warning: Widget class version mismatch\\\"?   This error, which typically goes on to say, \\\"widget 11004 vs.  intrinsics 11003\\\" indicates that the header files you included when building  your program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking  against was built with; check your -I include path and -L link-path to be sure.  However, the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the  X11R4 Xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. Some Sun OW systems, in particular, were shipped with the flawed version of the library,  and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you have seen.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  53)  Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster?   Webster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of Webster's Dictionary which are found at various (university) sites. After it became aware that these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster  and gnuemacs-webster, it asked that server sites close off external access.  [The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. A Webster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu  (129.79.254.192) in \\\"pub/webster/NeXT-2.0\\\".]  Unless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a site which can grant you access, you are probably out of luck.    However, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up the latest xwebster, as-is on export:contrib/xwebster.tar.Z [10/91]; the file  xwebster.README includes discussions of the availability, illegality, and  non-availability of dictionary servers.

What changes are there?  The Release Notes for each MIT release of X11 specify the changes from the  previous release.  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility  across releases.  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary,  details are given in the Release Notes.  Each X11 distribution site on the  network also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer; the  file typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree.

SUG's emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible service and value-added to our members.  Last year, the SUG 1991 disk contained plug-and-play X11R4, 20MB of additional essential binaries, almost 200MB of Sun patches, fully-indexed archives of Sun-related net postings, priced at only $250.  Our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be produced inexpensively, but to continue to supply as much value-added as possible.  To accomplish this, we will be putting out a two disk set, the first containing what's ready and needed now, the second available later in '92, containing more SPARC binaries and other useful material not found on previous disks.  The SUG 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by Robert A. Bruce, contains a lot of essential source code, and we decided it would be a great service to make it available right away to our members (and this pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per disk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  If you are not a SUG member, you can become one for an additional $40 if you live within the US or $55 outside.  The SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used by PC, Macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains a total of 543MB of material, including:  X11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after the initial distribution, thus, four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0 distribution are included (109MB of material).

When he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration, X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window, giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.     The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables.     Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?\",\"Hello all,  If anyone knows of a place to get the case to hold the power supply and motherboard of a Quadra 950 please let me know.

I want someone who would like to sell       an old copy.\",\" Oh contrer mon captitan!  There is a way.  Certainly it is not by human reason.  Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphrase Sartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing.  Your logic comes to fruition in relativism.    Ah, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in contemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus ('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of language he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's thought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary framework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features remain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own account, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to talking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but a threshold.   vonWrights's comment that Witt's \\\"sentences have a content that often lies deep beneath the surface of language.\\\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing ourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with Witt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes in our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more perspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it is already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man.  Perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.    This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in it conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of understanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \\\"as a man thinketh, so he is.\\\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside, that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals of truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that there is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too are knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the individual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to Christianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the Spirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has the capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not only has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things of God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep things of GOd that are absolute and true.    There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced and it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.    \\\"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would say unto me.\\\"  Job 23ff  --Rex\",\"[..stuff deleted]  I can buy a DES keysearch machine off the shelf now for approx $500K, but it is not sold by that name.

It helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very short description of the process which we use; if you have further questions, feel free to poke me via e-mail.  ================================================================ *ASSUME: locally smooth distortion  0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This    defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are    not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.    Consider deleting these edges.  1) Now, there are two goals:      a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)     b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)'s)        as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured         using the digitized (x,y)'s).  2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For    example:      a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you        can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will        slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the        Reference(x,y).      b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.        For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge        the correct length (where \\\"correct\\\" is the DigitizedLength).         Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the        point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the        triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.  3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).  alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider how much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to balance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length of the edges.  WARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed (essentially, you can't allow the convex hull to change, and you can't allow triangles to \\\"fold over\\\" neighboring triangles.  Both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using  the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the original positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was prohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I *might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more compute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having every point interact with every other point....but first read up on linear solutions to the n-body problem.  There are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on springs, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.  The above method is described, in more or less detail in:  @inproceedings{Sloan86, author=\\\"Sloan, Jr., Kenneth R. and David Meyers and Christine A.~Curcio\\\", title=\\\"Reconstruction and Display of the Retina\\\", booktitle=\\\"Proceedings: Graphics Interface '86 Vision Interface '86\\\", address=\\\"Vancouver, Canada\\\", pages=\\\"385--389\\\", month=\\\"May\\\", year=1986  }  @techreport{Curcio87b, author=\\\"Christine A.~Curcio and Kenneth R.~Sloan and David Meyers\\\", title=\\\"Computer Methods for Sampling, Reconstruction, Display, and Analysis of Retinal Whole Mounts\\\", number=\\\"TR 87-12-03\\\", institution=\\\"Department of Computer Science, University of Washington\\\", address=\\\"Seattle, WA\\\", month=\\\"December\\\", year=1987  }  @article{Curcio89, author=\\\"Christine A.~Curcio and Kenneth R.~Sloan and David Meyers\\\", title=\\\"Computer Methods for Sampling, Reconstruction, Display, and Analysis of Retinal Whole Mounts\\\", journal=\\\"Vision Research\\\", volume=29, number=5, pages=\\\"529--540\\\", year=1989  }   \",\"Hello,   I just got some SIMMs,  at least one of which does not work. I don't know if  there is a software that can test SIMMs thoroughly or I could just rely on the  RAM test performed by my computer during the start up. When I installed a dead  SIMM into an LC or  an LC II, there would be a strange music and no display on  the screen. Why? I need your help! Thanks in advance\",\" I agree with this assessment.  Furthermore, its promotion as providing greater protection than bare voice is quite true, as far as it goes.  However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal of letting LE wiretap \\\"terrorists and drug dealers\\\" is to restrict stronger techniques.    Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption, weak encryption, or (the vast majority) no encryption.  The latter two classes can be tapped.  With weak encryption in every phone, the no-encryption class is merged into the weak-encryption class.  Will the introduction of Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strong privacy to give up on it?  that is, to rely for privacy on a system expressly designed to deny it to people like them?  I doubt it.  The mere introduction of this scheme will give the government *nothing*.  The stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretapping capabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domestic cryptography, and only by this restriction.  \\\"Clipper\\\" appears to be no more than a sop, given to the public to mute any complaints.  We would find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff, but I fear the public at large will not care.  I hate to even mention gun control, but most people seem to think that an `assault weapon' (as the NYT uses the word) is some sort of automatic weapon, .50 caliber maybe.  Who wants to have such a thing legal?  Well, people know even less about cryptology; I suspect that strong cryptography could easily be labeled \\\"too much secrecy for law-abiding citizens to need\\\".   What they say is opinion, but what they do is what matters, and will continue unless overturned.  And the courts are reluctant to annul law or regulation, going to some length to decide cases on other grounds.  Furthermore, Congress can get away with quite a bit.  They could levy a burdensome tax; this would place enforcement in the hands of the BATF, who as we've seen you really don't want on your case.  They could invoke the Commerce Clause; this seems most likely.  This clause will get you anywhere these days.  The 18th was required because the Supreme Court ruled a prohibitory statute unconstitutional.  In 1970 Congress prohibited many drugs, with a textual nod to the Commerce Clause.  The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 still stands.  I think the government could get away with it. \",\" Windows NT is a giant Windows Operating System.  Unline Win3.1, it does not  run on top of DOS.  It is its own OS, with (Billy Gates assures us) true  multi-tasking/multithreading, meets DOD security specs, will run win3.1  programs as well as DOS programs, has multi-processor support, and is primarily a Server program.  It's overhead is too high for it to be economical for most users.  Speaking of overhead, it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM.   It iwll run with 12, but that's like running OS/2 2.0 with 4 megs.  And that's  just to run it.  Also, I have heard that the system files take up 30-50 Megs,  and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig!  The SKD is distributed  on CD-ROM.  Chicogo is what I want to use.  It is, like NT, a true OS with thrue  multitasking and multithreading, but has much smaller hardware requirements,  and does not meet DOD security specs (but that's okay since it will probably  be more of a client OS).  there are a few otehr differences, but those are the  main ones.  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August.  The Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro$oft are in intense  competition, so it is said.  However, I think a different relationship will  arise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology), Chicogo will be the  client machine.  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together,  partly because Chicogo is just a small NT (think of it that way, anyway).   (Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS, so don't scorn the concept.)  Anyway, don't expect it soon.  Windows 4 and DOS 7 are supposed to be  released next year (read: see it in 95), so I expect that Chicogo won't be out  til '96.  With luck, I'll be proven wrong! =)  Rob\",\"does anybody have any info on this monitor or the manufacturers?  all help through e-mail please.\",\"  Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation in Australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this approach.  It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_ (i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences. The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case. You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits?  There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently, because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor- General's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of controlling the population is still considered to be controlled shooting.   Some people take satisfaction (IMHO, legitimate satisfaction) in eating food that they have harvested themselves.  The pleasure derived from hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables grown in your own garden (and, in general, game meat is probably much  freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or the supermarket).   By \\\"cannot now be justified\\\" I guess you mean that you personally don't see any justification.  Fine--but what makes your opinion so important?   Certainly the last point is correct.  If politicians don't see any votes for themselves in opposing stupid legislation or in developing and supporting measures which might be effective in reducing the  incidence of violent crime they won't do these things.\",\" I bought my Moto Guzzi from a Univ of Va grad student in Charlottesville last spring.

They obviously don't listen to the people or want the people to know who is responsibile for what (a person telnetted the site of the Clipper chip release, to see what the entity 'clipper' was, and got a few lists. BUt when another person tried a bit later, the commands were disabled) Does not sound like an Administration that wants to have any accountability or information they don't control given to the people.  The secret development and implimentation of the Clipper Chip decision further backs that up.  You can bet unaurhorized encryption methods and software will be considered 'terrorist tools' and also subject to civil forfeiture, along with the systems that are running it.

There is a similar idea here in ex-USSR about how many militioners it needs    to place a new electric lamp.

To my mind the signature should be smth like:                    /       _                     __        /  .                 /_______/_/_______________    /________ /____/          /___ /      _                  /                                            Albert \",\"newly the pixel  is   You could set up a bitmap with a mask in it.  Clear the bitmap, draw the rectangle to be deleted with GXor.  Draw the one that is to stay with GXclear.  Then GXxor the entire pixmap with the screen.    Note that this is a pretty effective way of animation, if you ever need to do that (replace the GXclear with a GXxor).  ---------- Joe Hildebrand hildjj@fuentez.com Software Engineer Fuentez Systems Concepts (703)273-1447\",\"Quoth the Moderator:   In a short poem (\\\"God in His mercy made / the fixed pains of Hell\\\"), C. S. Lewis expresses an idea that I'm sure was current among others, but I haven't be able to find its source:  that even Hell is an expression of mercy, because God limits the amount of separation from Him, and hence the amount of agony, that one can achieve. \",\" 1992 HONDA ACCORD FOR SALE 35,000 MILES ALL HIGHWAY MILES EXCELLENT CONDITION WHITE EX MODEL \\\"LOADED\\\" $15,000 OR BEST OFFER call tom @ (201) 653-0638 h            (201) 795-5636 w  \",\" So what's your point?  Mark's comment still is valid.  To suggest that AIDS is \\\"deserved\\\" IS ludicrous.  I sin.  I can resolve to abstain from  sin, and do weekly (more often, actually).  Yet I routinely fail. I surely do deserve what I get, yet God compassionately provided  the Incarnate Logos, Jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation. If AIDS is deserved, I surely deserve instant death just as much, as do we all, as St. Paul so cogently remids us.  To willingly judge \\\"others\\\" as deserving punishment seems to me to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.      So what's the point here?  I can get AIDS and NEVER engage in \\\"deviant\\\" sexual behavior.  In fact, I could engage in LOTS of deviant sexual behavior with HIV+ people and never be infected.  AIDS is a consequence of particular behaviors, many of which are not sexual.  And not all sexual behaviors carry the risk of transmission.      The end of all things is to know, love and serve God, growing daily closer through prayer, meditation and discipline.  Even so I could get AIDS.  Anyone could, unless they remain forever celibate, IV-drug-free, and transfusion free.  Larry Overacker (llo@shell.com) -- \",\" ^^^^^^^^^ 1 Cor 11:31-32 \\\"But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment.  When we are judged by the ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^ Lord, we are being discipled so that we will not be condemned with the world.\\\"  1 Cor 5:3 \\\"Even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit.

Although a desire to show others of one's rightness may be a sign of arrogance in some cases,  it may be only a sign that they are following the Bible in others:  Jude :22-23 \\\"Be merciful to those who doubt; snatch others from the fire and save them; to others show mercy, mixed with  ^^^^^^ fear -- hating  ^^^^ even ^^^^ the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.\\\"    I hope you don't find me arrogant, then.  This sounds like a bad practice -- ignoring what certain people say because you perceive them as arrogant.

Smith, D.D.                               (1894-1977)            When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about      Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:                   Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son                of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief                priests and unto the scribes, and they shall                condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him                to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and                to crucify Him; and the third day He shall                rise again\\\" (Matthew 20:18-19).            Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,      who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving      reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He      knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious      leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that      one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual      death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly      how He would die--*by crucifixion.*            All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the      minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted      would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise      again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.            But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-      tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-      tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.            The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth      between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and      ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which      had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against      the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had      predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and      on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the      disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some      of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the      tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,      they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back      to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus' friends, Peter and      John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the      tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came      hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them      to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).            How did this tomb become empty?            One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--      professor of New Testament literature in a large theological      seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*      the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by      bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb      became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the      chimney at Christmas time.            But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down      any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa      Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the      tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.            Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-      bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by      mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.            Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,      tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar      in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)      that the women went to the wrong tomb.            The facts are these:            First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to      which by mistake they could have gone.            Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or      more people to forget the place where they have buried their      dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women      did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to      the wrong tomb?            Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?            There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the      evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.                    Now when they were going, behold, some                of the watch came into the city and showed                unto the chief priests all the things that                were done.  And when they were assembled                with the leaders and had taken counsel, they                gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,                Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole                Him away while we slept.  And if this come to                the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and                secure you.  So they took the money, and did                as they were taught:  and this saying is com-                monly reported among the Jews until this day                (Matthew 28:11-15).            This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the      fact that the tomb was empty.            You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never      questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to      see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.            Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that      the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples      came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*            How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?      Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.            Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject      the explanation, the very character and the later history of the      disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away      the body of Jesus.            First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in      Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to      contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His      resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there      had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,      then proved.            Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would      have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.      It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most      of these men did.            The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ      had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it      would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed      pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing      humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today      as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.            But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to      leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to      what had happened to Him.            Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.            He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning      (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-      18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He      walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that      night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper      room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).            A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at      the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren      on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the      apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-      8).            As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-      ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed      attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are      unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the      unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the      appearances.            Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our      leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are      antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest      thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.      Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;      Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of      Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president      of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.            But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has      it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:      it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.            Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He      claimed to have come down *from* God.            He said He was the way *to* God.            He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.            He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one      else had it.            He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to      us.            Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed      that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*            Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe      that His words are all true?            The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us      that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?            And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead      testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some      day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.            In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all      this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For      He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-      ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a      hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.\",\"  Yes, \\\"Clipper\\\" is a trademark of Intergraph.

I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.  The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate.  The difference is not in \\\"contraceptive technology\\\" but in the values taught to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids.  Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired.    Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't we teach \\\"safe drug use\\\" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it because we know that a class in \\\"how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs\\\" would increase drug use?  Why isn't \\\"drug abstinence education\\\" barred from schools because it teaches \\\"religion\\\"?

This day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy U.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.  The short version is that his testimony was consistent with the opening statements for the prosecution.  Cooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington) on August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation with five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was using night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up into two teams of three people.  The six later met at an observation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies Cooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to scout further possible surveillance sites.  Cooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into a gully to see, \\\"whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.\\\" Striker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking loudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.  They ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the \\\"fern field\\\"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance team had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should take cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy target and might be \\\"shot in the back.\\\"  As Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the road from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.  At this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to \\\"fend him off with his gun.\\\"  [It is unclear whether this means he clubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then took cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not noticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan got up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, \\\"Stop!  U.S. Marshal!\\\"  Harris then \\\"...brought the weapon around at hip level and fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw Bill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.\\\"  Cooper fired at Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon to bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then heard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the direction of the shots, yelled, \\\"You son of a bitch!\\\" and ran toward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him from directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the cabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward the cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two fingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and then his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the other three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large burst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.  On cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of throwing rocks into the gulley, asking, \\\"You wanted to lure that dog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?\\\"  Nevin also pointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had claimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him. Cooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and decided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the cross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an armed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at him [no answer was available].  Friday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.  Notes: There was no coverage of protestors.

Chance would have it that \\\"my weekend\\\" with my  daughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.  Although I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decided that the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith was too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a date), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.  During the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church.   When our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she  be baptised as Catholic. This wasn't a problem with me.  During a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease that affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward for two months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated \\\"effectively\\\".  In other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.  During the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over my daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday visitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study books to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.  Last fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings. At that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time, I started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend. I did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a religious community.  Today, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for  Communion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine (The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the pew in front of us.  I feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her religious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments if you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.  My daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and mature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly for religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with my daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.  My initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith in Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays with her again.  I do not want to \\\"drive her from the fold\\\", and would be willing to allow her to continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only for two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.  Any suggestions?  If you have a response, please e-mail me a copy. (I'm not a regular reader of this newsgroup.) (Naturally, feel free to post too!)  Thanks, and I hope you've had a happy Easter.

Xarchie 2.0 has been extensively tested on R4, R5, and a variety of other flavors of X, and on a wide range of machines. A summary of the new features (from the README) follows:    * Major improvements include:     - Multiple selections allowed in browser for use with other new       features (FWF MultiList widget).     - Ability to expand directories in browser.     - Real fully-integrated ftp implementation.     - Ability to save and reload query results, as well as print them.     - Ability to resort results, and sort results by user-definable       pseudo-weights.     - Online help browser.     - Color resources, done so that they don't break mono displays.     - FWF FileSelector widget for local file operations.     - Makefile.dst's supplied for the imake-impaired.

Someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast  to ban the ozone-depleting (CFC) chemicals and not gasolines and other  greenhouse-gas-producing compounds.  The greenhouse effect (produced by  infrared-trapping gasses like CO2 and methane) and the ozone-hole problem  (produced by long-lived, chlorine-containing molecules) are not the same  thing.  It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's  (chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which  are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms.  Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help  the greenhouse-gas problem, but would do nothing for the ozone problem.   Fred W.

I own a turbocharged one, and I would never buy a turbocharged vehicle unless I knew the owner and his/her driving/maintenance habits.   I have been wondering about that myself.  The '90 AWD models and the '91s were identical (except for the ABS option).     Yes.  Some owners had problems with the transaxles.  Using synthetic lubricants in the transaxles solved the problem in most cases.  The problem was not unique to the AWDs, however.  It was common to all models.  The Galant VR4 and GSX had the same transaxle, but I didn't see those listed in CR.   I don't know of any major complaints in this area, except that the battery that was installed at the factory had a low current rating.    The first FWD models (those built before May 1989) were recalled for brake upgrades.  Some FWD and AWD owners had problems with warped rotors.  Those of us who insist on using manual torque wrenches every time the lug nuts are tightened have never had a problem.   I can refer you to someone who has gone through a set of pads in one day!

Covey\\\" <covey+@andrew.cmu.edu> Subject: Gun Stats & Mortal Risks Date: Mon, 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (EST)   Folks,  Hail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal carried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled \\\"Armed Force.\\\"  I felt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat that \\\"A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.\\\"  I sent the following to the WSJ.  -----  Gun Stats & Mortal Risks  Preston K. Covey    Erik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~ 2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns in the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King County, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to kill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of the finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping firearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~     Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of bringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this:  What exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the risks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control do we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of cancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the risks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful here.    The NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us off.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a misleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice and terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far outweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your car were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or an innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not take the bus?     Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company of lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at stake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:   The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the number of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense (the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed by a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation is 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other cases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12 accidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided by 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King County between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of homes unaccounted.   The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on six counts:   1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or acquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and neighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members, dear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic, but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are relevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless Waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is criminological hogwash.   2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs populated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories -- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited by more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities like drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is very low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but avoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with histories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and certifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or vehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver crucially affect the risk.    3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill than to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of personal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike Larson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43 times as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this particular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about whether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by tautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question begged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any case, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal instruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths are personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility obviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by gun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to NEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself.  People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their homes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection course do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death as do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and other risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose norms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign us to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in the matter.   4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the NEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County, including those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total death toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other studies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from homicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these suicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these suicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce L. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press, 1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of Psychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of the NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to ~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the causes, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a profoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally disregard this issue.   5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable rate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the NEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases.  But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled self-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case dispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of justifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story on women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17, 1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic cases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were reported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported that 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In Time~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error by a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged by promulgators of the NEJM statistic.    6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation are arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even shot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the coin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or deterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where no human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed to media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the compendious research on successful armed defense, notably by criminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America , Aldine de Gruyter, 1992)?  Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are based on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is high (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare better than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance or those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year by 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and accidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable statistic than the NEJM scare stat:    A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or other crime than to kill anybody.      Of course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation; what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We should indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation of defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic.  Clearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by uncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we can hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we hardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically. \",\" This sounds a bit high to me.

Note the early use of PostScript technology, predating many of this year's papers listed in the April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.  -- Eric   Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),  by Dave Baraff, Tom Duff   From: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu  Newsgroups: comp.graphics  Keywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem  Organization: Program of Computer Graphics   I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.  First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon, or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.  Now, the phrasing of this question says \\\"if a line intersects a polygon\\\", so this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.  In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript.  (See \\\"PostScript Language\\\", by Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).  So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P, and then \\\"outputs\\\" the answer.  By \\\"output\\\", we mean the program executes a command called \\\"showpage\\\", which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus the original problem.  There are two small problems with this approach.    (1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the  reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of  Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of  Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.   (2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the  PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in  other words, will it halt?   Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a  Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is  undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn  out to be undecidable.   I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite precision and running out of ink, paper or both.  A couple of references might be:  1. Principia Mathematica.  Newton, I.

Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill NJ  The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know better, he's hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc. 37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)  --------  From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)  Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its second derivative.  (I think there's an '89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that deals with this).  --\",\"I have a 486sx/20, 5 megs RAM, 85 meg harddrive (Stacked to 160 w/Stacker 3.0), 3.5 floppy, 3 expansion slots, 2 drive bays, VGA card, no monitor. $650.00 or interesting combination of cash and trade.  Located in Chicago. Please e-mail to this address (tmccn@merle.acns.nwu.edu) or call Allister at (312)743-5603.  Thanks.   \",\"I recently aquired a Quantum Q250 harddisk. It is a 50 meg 5.25\\\" mechanism. It is SCSI. I have a few questions and a few problems. First there seems to be an extra connector socket on the back that I can't figure out what it is for. The address is set by some jumpers on the bottom so I don't think it is for that. Any ideas?  Second, it would be nice to get a hardware manual for the drive. There are a lot of jumpers on it that we don't know what they are for.  Third, I have got the drive to format. It took a while to get things to work and most of it is fine for now. The formating initialy was troublesome but seems to be ok. The main problem is if you do a reset on the MacPlus the drive disappears. If I shut the mac off and then back on agian then the drive comes up fine. Any ideas.  Please reply to one of the email addresses below.  Thanks\",\"well, the subject says just about all I intended to ask:  Is there no way to insert a 256 color into WfW 2.0 ?  When I try it, the picture turns into a 16 color pic. \",\"  Which objective system are you talking about?  What is its goal? Again, which brand of morality are you talking about?\",\"I can't help myself. I've tried to be rational,  to look the other way, but everytime it happens,  its uncontrollable.  I hate pre'80s motorcycles.  At first I thought it was a phase.  I though I would get used to them.  It didn't happen.  I tried gazing at CB750s and 900 customs, but each time I sadistically pictured them being hurled off of large precipice (I also picture a swarm of german tourists cheering and taking holiday snaps, but I can't figure that part out).  What am I to do?  Everytime I read a .sig containing  some spoked wheel wonder, I shudder and feel pity that the poor soul has suffered enough.  I imagine the owner scrapping out his (or her) living in a discarded Maytag refridgerator box, tucked in next to their CX500.  I'm hoping for some deliverance.  I had in the past loathed the Milwaukee machine, but I can actually begin to understand some of the preaching.  There must be hope.  \",\"   I did this.  I use a relay (Radio Shack 4PDT) instead of a huge switch.  This way, if the relay breaks, my drives will still work.  It works fine, but you may still need to change the CMOS before the drive switch will work correctly for some programs.  rp93\",\"      I note that you make no such case as you claim can be 'even more easily made'.  Yes, the argument can (and has) been made that current government policy creates even larger market barriers than there were in the first place, but there is no such term as 'government failure', since the government can change policies whenever it pleases.  The market doesn't do that and is governed by (relatively) well-understood forces.  This libertopican bilge about 'moral arguments' about taxation, etc., is, at bottom, so much simplistic economic thinking. It can only be 'justified' by cliche derision of anyone who knows more about economics than the libertopian -- which is what invariably happens.  Tripe a la Tommy, the new libertopian dish.    Wherever do you get this inflated idea of your own importance?  --  \\\"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live  in the real world.\\\"   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden\",\"With all the talk about this Clipper chip, I have developed one question...     HOW DOES IT WORK???  If you use this, then how does it get decrypted on the other end? Does the other party (receiving the phone call/mail/etc) have to know some code to  undo it? Do I use a different method for calling one party than I would for  another?. If the other party can decrypt it, doesn't that mean that someone else could also? I assume that if everyone has a different key, the only use would be storing secure data for later retrieval by the same key. This seems like a fundamental question to me, but I have very little experience with cryptosystems, other than DES. If someone could give me an explanation as to how it would be used (remember that I have had little experience with this sort of thing) it would be very much appreciated.

The pain and suffering cases for those tortured. The dollars/life lost caused by the inevitable collapse of the economy, and all the secondary effects of diseases, diet, etc.  Plus, the inevitable collapse of the economy as the gov controls it, becomes  corrupt, etc.  Do us a favor.

My goal is for this keyboard to look exactly like an AT sytle keyboard to its host system. This will be a highly endowed keyboard with a Little PCL from Z World at its heart.  The only thing I lack is detailed information on the hardware signaling that the 486 (with  Windows 3.1  and DOS 5.0) will be  expecting.  My project is independant of Windows, my hope is that some of you fellow Window's users/programmers will recognize what I need and be  willing to point me in the right direction.   I have The Winn L. Rosch Hardware Bible (2nd edition).  The HB gives most (if not all) of the information I will need concerning scan codes  and even a wire diagram for the PS/2 style connector I will need, but it  leaves a number of important questions unanswered. 1.  Is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication?  I'm     guessing synchronous since the host is providing a clock.  In either     event, how is the data framed? 2.  Is it half-duplex or truly one way?  I'm guessing half-duplex     since the host can turn LEDs on and off. 3.  Are there any chipsets available for communicating with the \\\"AT     keyboard standard\\\" (other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard)?  If anyone knows of a book or article (or any other written source of information) on the above, please advise me at gamet@erg.sri.com. Whatever I do it must be safe for I cannot afford to replace the 486 in the event of a booboo.  Thank you for your time.

In the Jewish tradition you are incredibly wrong!  They originate in the Torah and with Jewish ancestors, specifically the Patriarch Abraham (z\\\"l).  That knowledge was sent East to India and China when Abraham gave \\\"gifts\\\" (the commentators to Jewish scripture say this was the knowledge of the occult arts) to all the rest of his children when he sent them away to the East.  This assured that Isaac only, who remained with Abraham, would inherit his most important spiritual gifts, what eventually became Judaism.  So you see, other religions can have very parochial views too.  By the Jewish view, you are very mistaken, your scripture are not scripture, your gods are not gods, your practices a jumble of errors that lead people to idol worship and away from God.  That doesn't stop us from respecting you to the extent of not trying to convert you or proselytize you and being willing to dialog in a respectful manner.  We're content to let you live the way you care to live as long as you leave us be.  We are happy to co-exist as long as you give us the same right.  But your incredible rudeness and violent nature seems to preclude that. Too bad.  Is this typical of your religion?   You are a most presumptuous fellow!  How dare you presume that the \\\"typical\\\" New Ager doesn't acknowledge God and is selfish.  What trite, self-righteous, ego-ful garbage!  There are Buddhists, Christians, Jews, and those of many other religions here on this newsgroups for whom your words are simple slander.   Of course, from the Jewish perspective you are incredibly wrong.  We'd say that there is no \\\"godhead\\\" -- just created beings who may be enjoying a good laugh at your expense.   So not only are we selfish, we are also thieves and liars!  And you expect any of us to pay attention to you and your \\\"religion?\\\"  Why not call us more name?

This market is supplied with machines from authorised resellers who have more machines than they can sell.  They come into this state of affairs by overordering either accidentally or deliberatly to get a better wholsale price from Apple.  In either case they often obscure the serial nunber to protect their identity.  As a result the warranty is void.  You may save on sales tax but you have to pay for shipping.  I should also point out that mail order companies cannot get lower prices thatn the high volume authorised dealers unless they buy below dealer cost.  As a result the only way they can sell cheaper is by cutting costs and trimming margins.  Unfortunatly they dont seem to be doing too well.  The lowest prices I have been quoted mailorder do not beat the lowest prices available from authorised local dealers.  They are even further away from educational prices.\",\"One of those \\\"morning, just getting the coffee in me\\\" thoughts:    Waving at other bikers makes more sense than just \\\"Hey, how's it going,  nice to meet you on the road, have a good ride\\\"    1) If you're watching for other bikes to wave to, it means your attention  is on the road, where it should be, and you're more likely to see cages.\",\"Accounts of Anti-Armenian Human Right Violations in Azerbaijan #008 Part A                  Prelude to Current Events in Nagorno-Karabakh       (Part A of #008)        +------------------------------------------------------------------+       |                                                                  |       | \\\"Oh, yes, I just remembered.

Born 1959    Teacher    Sumgait Secondary School No. 10    Secretary of the Komsomol Organization at School No. 10    Member of the Sumgait City Komsomol Committee Office     Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15    Microdistrict No. 3    Sumgait [Azerbaijan]  [Note: The events in Kafan, used as a pretext to attack Armenians in   Azerbaijan are false, as verified by independent International Human Rights  organizations - DD]  I'm thinking about the price the Sumgait Armenians paid to be living in Armenia now. We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the price was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide our lives into \\\"before\\\" and ''after.\\\" We talk like that: that was before the war. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole epoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live, it will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even  sharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now . . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those inhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our losses and everything that happened.  Nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it to pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would be such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and  those who didn't.  That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you  could already smell danger in the air. But we didn't think that the danger was near and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as my parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children.  My parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought that they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.  In our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the afternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all our family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin crawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel like it's all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our  apartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in  his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely  locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We're known as a  hospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people  who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends of many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.  My parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my  mother, \\\"Run to the kitchen for a knife.\\\" But Mother was detached, pale, as  though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never  expected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A  girlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said,  \\\"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out  of the bedroom. We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment.\\\"  We went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl  crawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and Karina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that  perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside  me. I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to embrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina  was thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. We didn't have time to  say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout.  There was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from excited voices. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door to the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time Karina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back, but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us  immediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at  least so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their  eyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst in, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. They  came into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other  room. He didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma  snatched the axe from behind and said, \\\"Tell them not to touch the children.  Tell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.\\\" She said this to Father in Armenian.  There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They  understood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian,  they don't need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: \\\"You and  your children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your  children that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls,  our mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,\\\" and  so on and so forth, \\\"and we came to do the same thing to you.\\\" This whole time some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They  were mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren't any older people  among them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town,  all the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I'm  a teacher.  So they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took  him in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there, because he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all  but a crack. We couldn't see what was happening to Father, what they were  doing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off  Mamma's sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: \\\"I'm old enough to  be your mother! What are you doing?!\\\" He struck her. Now he's being held,  Mamma identified him. I hope he's convicted. Then they went after Karina,  who's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying  to lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their  consciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they  mustn't do it. She said, \\\"Come on, let's straighten this out, without  emotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we  ever do to you?\\\" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come  into our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and  coming--said, \\\"What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We  came here to kill them.\\\"  They pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she  didn't cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, \\\"What did we do to you? What did we do to you?\\\" And even later, when she came to,  she said, \\\"Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?\\\"  That group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only  broke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they  were beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain  nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do  was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they did to her. That's why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off,  they beat her savagely . . . It's really amazing that she not only lived, but  didn't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they  could to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists,  kicking her, using anything they could find.  Mamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn't feel any pain,  just didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they  did. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the apartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the  corners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, \\\"Let's take her  outside.\\\"  Those beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they  weren't afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time  I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't  afraid of what would happen to them.  When they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered  with blood--that's when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several  times from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though  I were recording it all on film. I think I'm a kind person by nature, but I'm  vengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don't deserve it. I hold  a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time  I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I'd remember them,  and I'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me  \\\"forget,\\\" you have to forget, you have to go on living.  At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and  despite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had to do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering  to an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that he's being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me and took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over me. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that they planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up with their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a  really deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I  suddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly  I felt myself flying. I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I  just imagined it. When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the  ground. And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was  still lying on the floor. And since I didn't scream, didn't beg them at all, they became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with their feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe- cially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.  I came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it.  Some people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn't  need any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had  even forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth  living.  There was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman  pain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come  because I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself,  and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to put an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The  person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well,  because he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he  has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person,  one who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see,  even during the investigation he almost called me \\\"daughter,\\\" he apologized,  although, of course, he knew that I'd never forgive him. Something like that  I can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my  words, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person's shoes, but then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never  forget it.  I wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one  could protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of  beasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything. I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.  And Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a couple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to  kill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an  end to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into  the other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don't know which one it  was, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was  thrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her  and made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all  the deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor  from the Melkumians' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a  little. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku, how we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He's a good person. He said,  \\\"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes, I, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,\\\" he says, \\\"nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and  think I never shall again.\\\" The door to his apartment was open and he saw  everything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken  the father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He  saw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven people. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the  brothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that  they were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to  do something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I  After I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and  Lyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn't even  remember my sister's name. I wanted to cry \\\"Marina!\\\" out to her, but could not. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn't for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus I saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had told them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both there by chance, that they weren't Armenians. Lyuda's a Russian, you can tell  right away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that she was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I'm glad  that at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . .  although her spirit was murdered . . .  At some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that  mob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his  name, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, \\\"Igor, help!\\\" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were  taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and  Lyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the  neighbors.  And the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment,  something like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.   Then they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one,  they were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out  onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already  sure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new blows. Someone  said, \\\"She's already dead, let's throw her out.\\\" When they carried me out onto the balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I  heard someone say in Azerbaijani: \\\"Don't kill her, I know her, she's a  teacher.\\\" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can't remember whose voice it was. It wasn't Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an  accent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks Azerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and threw me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and  I having opened my  eyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had  been beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember him. I only  remember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately  I can't remember anything more.  What should I say about Igor? He didn't treat me badly. I had heard a lot  about him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too much. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that  women usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan, if he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated very sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in  Ufa, and was injured, but that's not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that  all out later.  Among the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary  of the Party organization. I don't know his last name, his first name is  Najaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn't so sure, she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she  didn't want to endanger him. She said, \\\"He was there,\\\" and a little while  later, \\\"Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else.  No, it seems like it was he.\\\" I am sure it was he because when he came to see  us the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something  entirely different. The investigators haven't summoned him yet. He came to see us in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought  groceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started  crying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don't know if he was putting  us on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned  him to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn't in Sumgait.  The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is  right, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don't know how the  investigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn't he have gone  to Baku and arranged an alibi? I'm not ruling out that possibility.  Ill now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she  bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her  wedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband's  lives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A  Russian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He's an orphan who was raised by his grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a  special school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I'll say this--I'm  a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that boy is not at all mentally handicapped. He's healthy, he can think just fine,  and analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he's cunning, too.  After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.  He beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, \\\"Lady, if you give us all the gold  and money in your apartment we'll let you live.\\\" And Mamma told them where  the gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and  everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other  over and taking the gold from one another. I'm surprised they didn't kill one  another right then.  Mamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was black and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she  ran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his mouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil- low. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead,  halfway into the other world. He couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see,  and was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth,  it was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.  The bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father  out of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room, a small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people  were standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants,  everywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee service--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, \\\"I was afraid  to turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the  threshold I couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and  dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'.\\\" Mamma remembered one of the  criminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her,  out of one eye. She says, \\\"I realized that my death would come from that  person. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.\\\" Later they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.  I was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina  was already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. I was left all alone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even though I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and Lyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out. I went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another.  But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones  I had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the  ones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and  that all of that would die with me.  At some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I  didn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that we were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, \\\"Neighbor, is that you?\\\" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived I would remember him. That's when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been  taken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to  take the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he  started getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room.  The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in  the air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the  presence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities  or not. He said, \\\"Enough, let's go to the third entryway.\\\" In the third  entryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once  again that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as  they went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they  found, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had  already taken the other.  Four people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. They had to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over those 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I  identified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an  Azerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian: \\\"Sister, don't be afraid, I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.\\\" That's just what he said, \\\"those Azerbaijanis,\\\" as though he himself were not  Azerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, \\\"I'll drive them out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails and nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41.\\\"  That's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the  person in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened  to, the \\\"general,\\\" said that they were going to the third entryway.  Kuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself.  Marina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I was racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer.  He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut.  But the door was lying on the floor in the hall.  I went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt  from flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find  anything. He told me, \\\"Well, fine, I won't leave you here. Would any of the  neighbors let you in? They'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're  alive.\\\" He told me all this in Armenian.  Then he returned to the others and said, \\\"What are you waiting for? Leave!\\\"  They said, \\\"Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her  yourself. No, we want to do it to.\\\" He urged them on, but gently, not  coarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just boys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went down to the third floor with them himself, and said, \\\"Leave. What's the mat- ter, aren't you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?\\\" And he came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that  he couldn't hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I  told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really good terms with them.  We knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman  opened the door and immediately said, \\\"I'm an Azerbaijani.\\\" He said, \\\"I know.  Let her sit at your place a while. Don't open the door to anyone, no one knows about this, I won't tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.\\\" She says, \\\"Fine, have her come in.\\\" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I  had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into  tears. Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a  half-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, \\\"Do you know where my family  is, what happened to them?\\\" She says, \\\"No, I don't know anything. I'm afraid  to go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see  who's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian.\\\" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my  neighbor says, \\\"You know, Lyuda, I don't want to lose my life because of you,  or my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.\\\" During the butchery in our apartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl earrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was  still there. When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I  touched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it to her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.  I went out and didn't know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I  don't know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I  end up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the  apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor.  I had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had  hidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near  some broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing.  Then they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I  think that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were broken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay  there without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town  could hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that's what saved me. They were  burning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started picking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father's sport  jacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the one end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out.  And again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive, and I started to  strangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on  my mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me afterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got  burned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone's hand was protecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't know  how. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if  I found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I  had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on  living without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I  thought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her.  I tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed. He served in  Afghanistan, he should protect her.  While I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I thought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would  she live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among  themselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no children's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter.  Another said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good  job fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was  all over. They started to argue. A third one says, \\\"How come you get it? I  have four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what I need.  All these years I've been living in God-awful places.\\\" Another one says,  \\\"Neither of you gets it. We'll set fire to it and leave.\\\" Then someone said  that Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their place. And they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, and left.  Oh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite  frequently, \\\"Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let  them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians.\\\" Then they  said, \\\"Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!\\\" They repeated it  very often.         - - - reference for #008 - - -  [1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,     Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by     Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

IMHO, Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. His fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he created reminded me of the Clark of old.

I can't  remember him having any as of yet.)  Well, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris has truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and Toronto.

Its hard to predicatbaly drift a stock Mustang because of the suspension.   Yes. When i think Mustang, I think school-bus +  F16 motor. In my mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90 or so. It just isn't safe, check out your local junkyard, Mustangs outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in junkyards.  I find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the Mustang for poor brakes in relation to power. Ford should at least standardize on the SVO rear brakes for all 5.0's.     True of Northern Europe, latin countries are something else.  Kindof true. remember they were build by adolf in the '30's.   Yes.   \\\"Autobahn\\\" is the german word for freeway. Other countries have different names for loose equivalents; autostrada, autoroute, motorway etc.   Europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasn't passed as far as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than the US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred to the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things you really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more professional attitude to driving. You just never see two cars running parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.   You're wrong. GTI's  go this fast. Just kind of noisy, not the ideal  autobahn car. A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers foot on the floor. How do I know? - when you're not making any ground on the identical car in front of you!   If something happens at 130-150 you're dead, but the same goes for much over 35. Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. I feel much safer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical US traffic because most people seem to be awake. I've never seen any driver reading a book on an autobahn, I see it all too often in the US.  Craig  It just doesn't *seem* fast after 30 minutes or so of aclimation. everybody drives that fast, no big deal. \",\"Excerpts from netnews.comp.sys.mac.misc: 5-Apr-93 Re: HELP INSTALL RAM ON CEN.. by Jason Harvey Titus@farad     oh boy am i confused, I thought the entire point of the 72 pin simms was that you could use diffrent size simms so you could avoid having to use sets.  all horror stories not withstanding.\",\"Ack!

Three questions come to mid real quick for something like this.  Q: Which version of Adobe PS will we clone?  Aside from the level 1 and level 2 issues, Adobe has in the past released  new code that incorporates modifications/upgrades/fixes just as all other  software vendors do. The level 2 stuff may seem sound now, but I assure  you,changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to  dwindle in the face of competition. This allows them to shift people to  maintenance, as well as design efforts for level 3.  Q: Do we duplicate the bugs, or do we make it work correctly?  From the LaserWriter to the LaserJet 4 there have been bugs. (If I had  a number to call at HP or Adobe, they'ld have heard from me.) Deciding  which approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate.  Q: Do we follow the Red Book, or do we follow someone's implementation?  Without a doubt, there are differences between the Red Book and Adobe's  PS. With level 2 many issues have been refined but the Red Book does  leave big, big holes in the implementation specific stuff. It would be  nice it the Red Bood at least pined things down enough so that two  different implementations of Adobe's PS don't do the exact opposite given  an identical set of conditions.  Q: PSCRIPT.DRV?  Having done a lot of PS clone testing myself, the unfortunate side of  testing is the limited number of sources for test files. The primary  source we use is Genoa. And having characterizes their 1992 PS ATS files,  (1300+ of them) over half are taken from PSCRIPT.DRV. It may not ideal,  but the ATS files are what the printer vendors use. I'm sure that Adobe  uses them too, but Adobe's output is by definition correct, even if its  wrong.  Yes, there are some very poor clones. We've seen them here at Rastek (a sub of Genicom which has its own clone called GeniScript). Some are poor for lack of design, some are poor because they followed the Red Book, and some are poor because the vendors don't know what PS is.\",\"}>Look, if you can figure out a reliable means of keeping guns away from }>bad people, while not interfering with good people, I think we'd all be }>for it.

What I was asking is this:  Please show me that the most effective substance-absure recovery programs involve meetinsg peoples' spiritual needs, rather than merely attempting to fill peoples' spiritual needs as percieved by the people, A.A, S.R.C. regulars, or snoopy. This will probably involve defining \\\"spritual needs\\\" (is it not that clear) and showing that such things exist and how they can be filled.  Annother tack you might take is to say that \\\"fulfilling spiritual needs\\\" means \\\"acknowledging a \\\"higher power\\\" of some sort, then show that systems that do require this, work better than otherwise identical systems that do not. A correlation here would help you, but as you point out this might just be demonstrating swapping one crutch for annother. (however, I do feel that religion is usually a better crutch than alchohol, as it is not usually poisonous! :) )  I hope with that clarification, my question will be answerable.

The Hizbollah and their affiliated groups have made several attempts to infiltrate the border of Israel.   True, but the Syrians did allow (until at least 1984) guerillas to operate in the areas that were under their control, provided that those guerillas were attacking Israeli lines.

If this were so, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide would be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in cities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show a higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this not to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks (which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants), the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the proportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.  What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on the part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended to show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave physical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the head neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this pattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.

Actually, I'm not fond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and Americans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic differences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I don't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent crime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every law-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.  On the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more culturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive, seven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates of Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities with roughly the same population, urban economy, geography and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.  In Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After a 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed weapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.  In Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason to purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted. Recreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are regulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a restricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box. In short, gun control but not unreasonably so.  Both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for gun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers studied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated), burglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from 1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same standard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.  Results: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver (1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99). 18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in Vancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 / 1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher (1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by weapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged. Although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were far more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.  Over the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle (11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000). After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations, the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as compared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.  When homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate of homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in Seattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver. Virtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns accounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns were 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than in Vancouver.  The authors of the report also investigated \\\"legally justifiable\\\" homicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during the seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only 21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in Seattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After excluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these earlier findings.  -------  This is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the argument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because Vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times that of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports annual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC, Chicago, Los Angeles and Houston.  Critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a gun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently. If the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to be higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study interval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns was not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that few would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.  As well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding citizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did experience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these cases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities during the course of the study period.  And, as was reported, Seattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category over Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for self-defense.

Please reply to ktj@reef.cis.ufl.edu\",\" Aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide, so a product of its hydrolysis is going to be methanol, which can then be oxidized to formaldehyde.  The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise, since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time.  In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable. Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings, say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses the body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver. If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde, it is actually relatively non-toxic. \",\"  Seems that you're more \\\"just misinformed\\\" than \\\"just wondering.\\\"  The comparison you're making is not just totally off base, but offensive to all sane people.\",\"Wow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I think it's great!  However, I think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answers to the simple(?) question:  Which would YOU choose, and why?  Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50.  I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?  Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?  Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost?  I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI HD's SCSI-2?

The NEC is sharper, flatter, less distorted, and more stable.  I have heard  complaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control  problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all.  There was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not  match up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the  frequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that  the NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter  and the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable  pincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness  when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the  controls.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the  raster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome  as the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.  I have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold  through OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that  way at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has  my vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if  it's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to  buy.

Helsingfors IFK have been around since 1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think you're exagerating here.   That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian & American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean Burke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn  McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been  3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the  Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford  or Tampa Bay currently are doing. --- But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia?  Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:  (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=NHL regular+) (13-17=NHL regular) ( 8-12=role player)  FINLAND:    D-Jyrki Lumme.......20 D-Teppo Numminen....20 D-Peter Ahola.......13  C-Jari Kurri........25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16  R-Teemu Selanne.....27  L-Esa Tikkanen......20 (Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)  SWEDEN: D-Ulf Samuelsson....21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom...18 D-Calle Johansson...18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin......13 D-Tommy Albelin......7  C-Mats Sundin.......26 C-Thomas Steen......18  R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen........18 R-Michael Nylander..13  L-Per-Erik Eklund...18 L-Johan Garpenlov...16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon........14  This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's Selanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL. --- Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America. Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in  Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points. Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \\\"dynasty\\\" talk isn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time, won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top  Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a  couple of years the same way Edmonton's \\\"dynasty\\\" crumbled in the late '80s.  Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an  exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a  compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during  the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this,  the amateur draft should be open to anyone.  \",\"Okay, okay, Norman himself isn't actually for sale.

The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a symbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that the _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar, Relics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real, almost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real sacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking precludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it simply IS holy.  But, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if well- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely to see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which could be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the mass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the real thing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't dare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have been encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing on _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in liturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or the heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita bread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but Catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body.  Modern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We try to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience. It doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the genius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize' is only slightly better.  What are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it doesn't work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well prepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW a matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is the attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative liturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean the Church will be socially conservative.  In NYC I can recommend:  Corpus Christi - W 12st St.  Corpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy,   St. Joseph's, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, \\\"clean\\\", largely gay  Oratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful  Avoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.

A single chip micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily.  An 8748 only costs about $5.  That and a $1 crystal and you're in business.  Embed the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell, use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don't want to try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut you a special low temperature crystal.  It'll cost at most $20.  If you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of  maybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FET to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than  you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.  Add a power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count screams up to 9.

The idea I've gotten is that to christians, Hell is -- like Heaven --  afterlife; i.e, you don't cease to exist, but are subjected to eternal   torture (well, that's the orthodox idea anyway; \\\"eternal death\\\" if you  prefer that). Atheists don't believe in any sort of afterlife.    I think it's safe to say that Hell was never intended metaphorical. Certainly  not the equivalent of ceasing to exist. Some christian concepts are indeed  metaphors, but your idea of Hell is a 20th century interpretation. It is, of  course, nice to see that even christianity might evolve to fit the worldview   of modern age, but I fear the church will not accept it. Understandably, per-  haps, because if you accept that Hell is a metaphor, then you're one step  closer to turning God into a metaphor as well.\",\"jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu:     Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area.  It would not    be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be    local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill    AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.    High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but    the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun    - and would pay through the nose for it.  Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude, homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate fire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall the tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for use by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of effective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of killing German soldiers for their guns.  Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, was specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible. The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel tubing, hand tools and a welder.  I still think that while the point is good, I think there's a difference between marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown locally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I think the demand for \\\"real\\\" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling economically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, the result would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have firearms, and \\\"bad guys\\\" will continue to have access to them, one way or another.  And I don't see that as a necessary situation.\",\"Nintendo 8 bit system, power pad, light gun (zapper), 2 controllers  Games: Supermario, duck hunt, power field, and wings.

In order to turn the spacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be available, or you need to retrain a new team.  Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed. Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA  series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set. Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a \\\"standby\\\" mode for use in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is still required to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is relatively cheap.  Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance to stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin- stabilized control mode because it would require little power or  maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time to time.

I cannot know what the angle between the tube and screen is.  Do I have to assume that they are parallel to do the transformation?  How do I do this transformation?

How can I compensate the ellipse's axis for this image distortion?  So, please can anyone give us a few pointers here?  How do we transform the image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen, and how do I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen?

It's use as prayer language seems especially troubling to me.  I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doing the talking.  And when you pray, you pray to God.  And the Spirit is God.  So, the Spirit is talking to Himself.  Which is why I only go by the Pentecost use where it's an actual language.  Moreover, the phrase \\\"though I speak with the tongues of men and angels\\\" used by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would then assume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, it is no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.  Hmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see how God PUNISHED by giving us different language.  Can we assume then that if angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME one amongst other angels?  After all, THEY were not punished in any manner.  So why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE ANOTHER?  It's disturbing to think that some people find ways to  justify jabbering.  But I'll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned.  Trouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts at verification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that the witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outright fabrication was involved.

(It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.) As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:   - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out      of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own     breathing effort (let alone anything else)    - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is     expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled     is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)     So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done     by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen     tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough     oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.    - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough     gas per unit volume.     Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs or interfere with their healing or anything like that...  \",\"I have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode'd GIF images contain charts outlining one of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in Crystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can be reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at mholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.  Mark proposed this design, which he calls \\\"Geode\\\" (\\\"rough on the outside, but a gem on the inside\\\") or the \\\"ET Strongback with integrated hab modules and centrifuge.\\\"  As you can see from file geodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much of the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte Manipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS) pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting can occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass properties of the Station change during assembly.  The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because it can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong part of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are limited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the docking system.  The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional launch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit (contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've never had a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to (performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual de-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the residual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from impact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating the local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing further micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember, it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.  The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment Gyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used for gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system which can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a controlled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like we did with Skylab).  The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be used for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity on humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device for the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on one of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.  This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical, data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work done to date.  Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City, and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter seems more likely.  Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design; you should see his notes in the GIF files.

The answers I received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working. However, during this process I have come up with new problems.  1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic string. Is this inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS or VB?  2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the DDE SQL command, (provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names) but how is one meant to update a database?    a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.    b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command from VB cannot       be used because when the macro requests information from VB using a       second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time- outs occur.       (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access to VB channel       is initiated, I guess.)    c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.      The way I eventually managed to update a database was by sending key-    strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. This technique has    the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a    state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB sends.  Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect assumptions? Are there any better work arounds to the above? Are there any signs of an ODBC driver for Access?\",\" After IBM had invented the DES and the NBS had advertised for proposals, but before IBM had decided to respond, I argued strenuously that they  should not; they should keep it proprietary.   The biggest proponent of proposing was Dr. Lewis Branscomb.  Dr. Branscomb was the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS.  Fortunately for all of us, Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above question much better than I.  He realized how difficult it would be to gain acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism.  Because of the necessary complexity, publicity would not be sufficient and neither would  authority.  In fact, it has taken both of those plus more than 15  years.  We have also had independence.  The DES was solicited by NBS, invented and proposed by IBM, and vetted by NBS.  It has also been examined and vetted by experts like Adi Shamir, who are not subject to influence by any of these.  Even now, there are still people posting on this list who do not trust the DES in spite of all the time, all of the analysis, and all of the public scrutiny.  (Of course, it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to  gain acceptance for a novel mechanism, developed in secret, on the basis of authority alone.)  We had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can \\\"break\\\" the DES.  That is a silly question.  At some cost and in some time they can \\\"break\\\" anything.  The important question is at what cost and in what time.  The fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so important as what we know about their strength.  As long as we understand the cost and duration for an attacker, then we can use them in a safe way. At this point, we may never replace either because of the inability of any successor to overcome this knowledge gap.  DES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the century and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography.

If you're at all interested in this merchandise, please e-mail me: djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu   I'm compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system, so I have two monitors and cards for sale. Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces, I'm just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from one screen.   I'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas (within driving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but I CAN ship to you if you don't live near here. Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxes for the monitors, but I'm confident that my few months of full-time service in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and flip it in your direction.

It's a great monitor, in great shape, but I'm going to a bigger screen, and although I'd like to keep it, finances don't justify it.   Still selling for $599 at MacLand (where I bought it originally - not including shipping), will sell for **$475** (plus shipping). Again, make an offer if that sounds unreasonable.

Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 meg SIMMS).   Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking **$525** (shipping included this time, it's just a card). Original box and packaging.

See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where  Lane Fox writes, \\\"... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus'  career] is agreed to be a Christian addition.\\\"  In my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21 April 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine  Pagel's _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  \\\"A comment *attributed* to Josephus reports ... [emphasis mine]\\\".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention the two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.  So far as I can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things:  1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the long passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory.  I don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are orginally developed (does anyone?).  Biblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The former, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and ideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I  didn't elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to incorporate theology).  Can't say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before  Gutenburg).

Furthermore, the Church has always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free will.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also affected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and Jansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4).  For God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect, who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final perserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those without that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need it, as they had freely chosen hell.          ^^^^^^^^^^^ People who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own effort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined them to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were deserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and sinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.   Well, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some blessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little), for those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And those He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one or in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal punishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it (cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder were forgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I need not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement is quite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from the Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira, Jerusalem in 70 AD, etc.  not a >good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we not >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more  We should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the U.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am an isolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But in the case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily involved, it would not be a \\\"just war.\\\"  \\\"Blessed\\\" after all, \\\"are the peacemakers\\\" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Our actions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is unrelated to anything to justify it for us.\",\"   ARGHHHHHHHHHh  READ THE MEMOS!!!!

Personally, I use both. \",\"I want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around 5 megabytes / sec for very large data transfers.  (Around 5 MB.)  I have a Quadra 950.  I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.          (using block-mode transfers) I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can          achieve 6.8 MB/s.  Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.  It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer, then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s result in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)  So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer,   Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer. Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer. Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.         ... Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer. Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card.  Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously, and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho') each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.  Why?  Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time.) Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use the same bus to mac RAM?  Is there anything I can do?\",\"   I thought that he was comparing Cullen to TEEMU SEL[NNE.

I have used Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2.  I wrote a resource converter from OS2 to Motif, but it really wasn't too easy, especially the naming scheme. In Motif you cannot rename controls/widgets. With windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance, this doesn't work for Motif, you'd have to call it Dialog1_OK, and Motif expects a text string rather than a number.  So  your constructor should know how to convert a #define into the proper resource identifier. I'd check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does use resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to port to.

According -> > to the Federalist Paper's, a well regulated militia has a well defined  -> > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations. ->  -> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!  Perhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the \\\"well regulated malitia.\\\"  Here is what is says about its character:    To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes   of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through   military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to   acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the   character of a well-regulated militia,   It also talks about the \\\"well regulated militia\\\" having a nationally uniform in structure and disipline.    I will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:       Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with  respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed  and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it  will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of  a year.  But, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large group of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people every year, provide a basic training to new people so they can be integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it  requires a continually standing committee of organizers.    Since a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and disipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim a \\\"well regulated militia\\\" is not well organized.  But I will concide  a \\\"well organized militia\\\" is not necessarily a \\\"well regulated militia.\\\"   Several people have stated that the \\\"well organized militia\\\" is what is defined under 10 USC 311, which states   The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied   males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in   section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are,   or who have made a declaration of intention to become,   citizens of the United States and of female citizents of   the United States who are commissioned officers of the   National Guard.  This deos define the militia, but were is the adjective \\\"well regulated.\\\" 10 USC 311 does not define a \\\"well regualed militia\\\" in any way, shape,  or form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia The Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the \\\"well regualed militia\\\" as a proper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it talk above \\\"disciplining all the militia of the United States\\\" so they fit the \\\"character of a well-regulated militia.\\\"  This is what the paragraph states about the associated costs:   It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor   of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the   present numbers of the people, would not fall far short   of the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all   the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the   mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,  would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not   succeed, because it would not long be endured.   Another quote provide by Charles Scripter is: James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \\\"General Welfare\\\" clause):   \\\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first  to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a  recital of particulars.\\\"  So the phrase \\\"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall  not be infringed\\\" must either qualify or explain the phrase \\\"a well  regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\\\"   The definition of \\\"explain\\\" as stated in \\\"The American Hertitage Dictionary of the Enlish Language\\\" The New College Edition, 1982 is:  1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;     elucidate: \\\"It was the economists who undertook to explain      this puzzle\\\"  2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.  3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify:     explain an error The second phrase clearly does not \\\"explain\\\" the first, therefore the second phrase must \\\"qualify\\\" the first.  The definition given for \\\"qualify\\\" is:  1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities     of; characterize.  2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or      task.  3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.  4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.  5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate  6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase) Since \\\"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed\\\" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and it has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task. By process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since #3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it must be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, \\\"the right  of the people to keep and bear Arms\\\" gives legal power to the \\\"well  regualated militia\\\" and this legal power \\\"shall not be infringed\\\".    I thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more  evidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the  people's right to form well regulate militia, and says very little  about the right of an untrained person to \\\"keep and bear\\\" a .50 caliber machine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm (something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun safety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine gun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with me.  -> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy -> our Liberties and Rights.  I mean \\\"to destory our Liberties and Rights.\\\"  Is that why a participate in the discussion of exactly what \\\"our Libertues and Rights\\\" are?  I  force my version of \\\"our Liberties and Rights\\\" by begining statements of what \\\"our Liberties and Rights\\\" with \\\"All that the Second Amendment  clearly states to me.\\\"   Using expressions, such as \\\"states to me,\\\"  clearly mean I intend to force my views on others?  I don't think so.  So in effort not to force my views and not \\\"to destory our Liberties and Rights,\\\"  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in the matter of \\\"Liberties and Rights\\\" is the final word.  For I am only one person among many and the final word on \\\"Liberties and Rights\\\" cleary and irrevocably belongs to the many.\",\" It depends on the bike. Once you've found a bike you're interested in, call some insurance companies for rates. Some bikes are much cheaper to insure than you might think (my EX-500 only costs me $127/year in St. Louis; I'm 27)  For a first bike, I recommend 500cc's or less. And a bike short enough to get both feet on the ground when you stop.   The one piece of advice EVERYONE will give you is to take a Motorcycle Safety Foundation Rider's Course. See a dealer for details. In some states, completion of such a course can give you a break on insurance. It will also teach you to ride properly from the beginning, so you won't learn any bad habits.  Good luck.

These are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by people around me.  1.      Is it true that the Israeli authorities don't recognize Israeli nationality ? And that ID cards, which Israeli citizens must carry at all times, identify people as Jews or Arabs, not as Israelis ?  2.      Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders and that Israeli governments from 1948 until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of the State of Israel should be ?  3.      Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons ? If so, could you provide any evidence ?  4.      Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets ?  5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied territories are subject to different laws than non-Jews?  6.      Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 1947/48 to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return, while their Christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return ?  7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948, as is done today in Bosnia-Herzegovina ?  8.      Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as members in kibbutzim?  9.      Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage marriages between Jews and non-Jews ?  10.

Pappas, Estrada, Steve Barber, and . . . ?\",\" I don't think anyone is arguing that there would be no effect. But there would be no _net_ _positive_ effect. You also have to  consider the negative side: Law abiding citizens, armed with  fireamrs (pistols for the most part), prevent between 80,000 (National Crime Survey) and 1,000,000 (Dr. Kleck) crimes each year. (Those are the extremes. Most studies find the number to be 500,000 to 600,000.) About 1% of those crimes are homicides, so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately 5,000 lives each year. There are roughly 12,000 criminal homicides and fatal accidents involving guns each year. For there to  be any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measures would disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns. That would be very hard to do: According the the federal BATF, only 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Since gun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legal sales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed, law-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on armed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.)  That doesn't sound like a net benefit to me.     Since most were with licensed weapons, I assume you are not supporting \\\"reasonable\\\" laws (i.e. waiting periods, background checks, licenses, etc...). Since only a complete ban would  alter the statistic you refer to, I assume that's what you are supporting.  By the way, 1135 people dies in 1986 from falling down stairs. 250 accidental handgun deaths isn't significant next to  other household accidents.   1080 children under the age of 10 died by drowning, 69 from  drinking poisonous household chemicals (like Drano), 139 from falls. If the real goal is to reduce the tragic, accidental deaths of children, wouldn't a ban on drain cleaners be a  better palce to start? (Or, perhaps, restricting ownership to professionals like plumbers?)   While you might call it \\\"emphasis\\\", refering to completely two statistics in the same sentence _implies_ a comparison. If it isn't valid, and you put the numbers together to convince people you are right, the kindest thing I could call it is propaganda.\",\": >over where it places its temp files: it just places them in its : >\\\"current directory\\\".  : I have to beg to differ on this point, as the batch file I use : to launch cview cd's to the dir where cview resides and then : invokes it.  every time I crash cview, the 0-byte temp file : is found in the root dir of the drive cview is on.

As many knowledgeable people have pointed out, msg is a naturally  occurring substance in a lot, if not most, foods.  When food  manufacturers add it to a preparation, they do so because it's a  known flavor enhancer.   Your wife's theory, that MSG is added to food to stimulate appetite,  may well be true.

The resolution you requested is about 0.3mV In order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower than that.  It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect inside a PC.  Before you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a low distortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD.  Digital Domain ?  There are possibly other low THD sources)  Run the digitized waveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor on the spectrum.

If you can live with 14 bit resolution, I would recommend looking at the MAX121 from MAXIM.  It is a high speed (308KHz) complete sampling A/D with DSP interface.  The input range is +/- 5V and it uses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolated from the computer to elinimate a major noise source)  The Analog design guide I got from them shows a -100db noise level.  They claim a -77db max (-85 typ.) THD.  Looks pretty good for the $12 @ 1000 pieces  A evaluation kit is available.

This assumes that you can build your own DAS and write your own software. (Hey you can get the MAX121 as a free sample just by calling the 1-800 #)   I would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out of your system by looking at the noise level, otherwise you might be throwing out your money.

Student\",\"i am sorry, but this genoa card does nothing that the ATI ultra plus 2mb can't do, PLUS the ATI costs 330$US street price ....  \",\" To answer your irrelevant question, yes a person of color is human, but I still don't know what you mean by human being and you have merely begged the question without responding.  By trying to inject the notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without adding any insight whatever.  The same parallel question could be \\\"Is a polydactyl person a human being?\\\"  You still have not answered what you mean by human being.  Please do so.   You won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies. If you want a definition of human being that does not depend on the vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule, provide it for me.   More irrelevancies.  As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does not follow your version of human being.  And as he pointed out, brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights of the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant difference.  What I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the thread you started?  You got answers to your questions when you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some ridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected, changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion of substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance, why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss silly accussations, e.g. \\\"It really doesn't matter to you...\\\" If it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek some substance?  You're not going to convince a logical person of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic and show some meaning to your words.   As others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on which has the better chance at survival.  Again, your analogy fails.  Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here. A woman's womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would not be granted a born human being.  Was that due to its inconvenience?   Is it?  Please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling.   You simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is not accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on for size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments. But the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The systems are dependent on each other for life.  I'm still struggling to see anything analagous here and failing to do so.   Your argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total failure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in reality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible, that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said, you give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe in now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where they cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said, there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim that is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a claim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to its claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?   You haven't answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.   Again you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and it is not as slow as you seem to think.   Yes, and I'd hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn's children that he was murdered by a religious, \\\"pro-life\\\" fanatic.  Please do try to stay relevant.   Clever comeback.  I congratulate you on the readiness of your wit.  What happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake? Why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  What is different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at stake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction are irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction anyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have borne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at parties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.\",\" Gerry Cheevers used to have a mask that had stitches painted all over it.\",\"} }>  Drugs are banned, please tell me when this supply will dry up? } }Drugs are easier to manufacture, easier to smuggle, easier to hide. } }No comparison.

Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.  value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in  usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus.  The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound.   In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing.  In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the word \\\"value\\\" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as \\\"objective values.\\\"  Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow. Just because the word \\\"values\\\" is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts.  If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  So, back to the original question:  And objective morality is.....?  If you can provide an objective foundation for \\\"morality\\\" then that will be a good beginning. \",\"[MODERATOR:  Nice summary, Keith, thanks.]  I talked to the federal Dept. of Justice (DOJ, Ottawa) to try and clarify a bunch of things regarding changes to Canadian gun laws. I am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email, followup to t.p.g.  1. It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get    a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I    was told by a police officer. 2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to    protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns    must be stored locked up and unloaded, however. 3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will    be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.    The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form    authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.      Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these    'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will    be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess    them, but will not be allowed to stock them. 4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will    not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations    specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some     manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.    (God knows how much they'll charge for these)  This covers most of what we discussed.

My friend found out about the matter quite accidently.  After reading some of my mail, I quit from the mail reader & went about my business.  I must have trashed my mail improperly, because he got on the same terminal the next day & saw my old messages.  He thought they were responses to a post he placed in alt.atheism earlier that week, so he read some of them before realizing that they were for me.  I got a message from him the next day; he apologized for reading my mail & said that he did not want to appear to be a snoop.  He said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views & didn't mind doing so, especially with a friend.  So we did.  I neither changed his mind nor did he change mine, as that was not the point.  Now he knows where I'm coming from & now I know where he's coming from.  And all that I can do is pray for him, as I've always done.  I believe the reason that he & I \\\"click\\\" instead of \\\"bash\\\" heads is because I see Christianity as a tool for revolution, & not a tool for maintaining the status quo.  To be quite blunt, I have more of a reason to reject God than he does just by the fact that I am an African-American female.  Christianity & religion have been used as tools to separate my people from the true knowledge of our history & the wealth of our contributions to the world society.  The \\\"kitchen of heaven\\\" was all we had to look forward to during the slave days, & this mentality & second-class status still exists today.  I, too, have rejected an aspect of Christianity----that of the estabished church.

Around the base of the hourglass is a ring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser in the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled through the tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  The sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for draft generation.  It should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on both fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at  locations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part time, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit. It was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish. Fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent, usually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typically takes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed  to cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.\",\"If the Islanders beat the Devils tonight, they would finish with identical records.

(No doubt it won't be long before someone posts explaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and long-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to subvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.)  My feeling is that the administration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and RSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they'll never be used by a group much wider than us computer geeks.  The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:  1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just     now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time.  2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able     to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I     find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy     for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the     administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for     all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made     widely available.)

Does anyone know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.  The main thing I just don't get is whether this chip implements symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know?  I'm guessing symmetric, but they don't get very clear about it.  If it is symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level encryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate a per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted third party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session key?)  If it's asymmetric, what about PKP's patents, which they claim cover all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?  Are they getting royalties, or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping the algorithm secret? :-)\",\" This does sound good, but I heard it tends to leave more grit, etc in the  oil pan.

When it is established, its    parliament will convene and decide.    And replace them with what?  If Israel is to withdraw its control of any territory, there must be two prerequsites.  One is that it leads to a reduction in deaths.  The second is that it should not weaken Israels bargianing position with respect to peace talks.   Leaving Gaza unilateraly is a bad idea because it encourages arabs to think they can get what they want by killing Jews.  The only way Israel should pull out of Gaza is at the end of negotiations. These negotiations should lead to a mutually agreeable solution with security guarantees for both sides.

With I/O overlap, your CPU can continue to \\\"think\\\" while disk operations are underway, whereas without overlap, your CPU sits idly waiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations take an *eternity*, compared to a fast CPU.  So, when you've got multi-tasking, you want to increase performance by increasing the amount of overlapping you do.  One way is with DMA or bus mastering.  Either of these make it possible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory without interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move the data.  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and bus mastering.  IDE, however, is defined by the standard AT interface created for the IBM PC AT, which requires the CPU to move all the data bytes, with no DMA.\",\" When will you people realize that our right to keep and bear isn't primarily intended to be for protecting against criminals and beasties in the wild?

That's especially true for sci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since the traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.  I'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my followup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your feelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an 80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less acceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one repository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper would need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out in this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search. A slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number, and then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys, neither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant to attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect the subkeys even more.  Other thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of the databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be their back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories' public keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session keys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This would answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you make sure they stop''.  We can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back door -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record of the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of the warrant.  I can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100 public key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need more keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be used to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant; the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very long.  I suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from the obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the back door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned about foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard rumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with DES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it was much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)

April 23, 1993 (Phone:  202/358-1780)  Kyle Herring Johnson Space Center, Houston (Phone:  713/483-5111)  RELEASE:  93-76  HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS   The December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability for an additional two, if needed.   The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times required using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actual EVA tasks on previous missions.   \\\"Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three is to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the dynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks,\\\" Mission Director Randy Brinkley said. \\\"It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.\\\"   In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the spacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays and the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives during the mission.   \\\"When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through lowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays, WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each spacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate,\\\" said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight Director for the mission.   While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than previous missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.   \\\"We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,\\\" Heflin said.  \\\"In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible to accomplish the mission objectives.\\\"   Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions that include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated simulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone underwater training \\\"runs\\\" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.   Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the mission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight will be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.   Endeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will include spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission. The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.   Also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the experience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and trainers.   Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.   The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that time the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in 1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have become necessary.\",\"  First off, I haven't used W4WG (but I think that's about to change!).

These practices, amply documented in hearings before this Sub- committee, leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregarded rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the United States.    It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise of the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens.    It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search- ing and seizing private property.    It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property without just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with- out regard for their right to due process of law.    The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau was utterly unconvincing. Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of the Treasury Department, asserted vaguely that the Bureau's priorities were aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille- gally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely to be used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recently made great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen- tation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings before BATF's Appropriations Subcommittee, however, expert evidence was submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither criminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into unknowning technical violations.

The Bureau has made itself a key component in preventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-risk youth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known gangs from access to weapons.   The Waco, Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF on the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession (automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombs and other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case, ATF is asked to trace weapons through its' National Firearms Tracing Center, where they keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATF is the Federal governments' firearms expert and routinely works with state and local police to execute warrants.  ATF, working with state and local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys' office felt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally establish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and thorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members of the Branch Davidians.  In addition, ATF carefully selected a Sunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men would be separated from the women and children and not in the area where it was known that the illegal weapons were stored.   As you may be aware by now, Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koresh spiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending execution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately, ATF lost the element of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and prepare for ATFs' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situation presented itself, the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the FBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition, and military tanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and firepower of the Branch Davidians.   Based on what I have learned about ATF's role in the Branch Davidian raid, I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am, however, deeply saddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who attempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the cult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a thorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside the Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for Enforcement.  In addition, ATF will conduct its' own review of the Waco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the evaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick and peaceful conclusion.

However, both Minnesota and Wisconsin stuck out, solely on the basis of their politics.  Both have  always translated to extremely liberal and progressive states. And my recent trip to Minnestoa last summer served to support that state's reputation.  My guess is that Wisconsin is probably the same.

Here is a reply to one of the letters.  Seems to me that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell!]    Your using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers.  Of course, in your termonology, God could not \\\"cease to exist.\\\"  However, that is not what death ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see that it signifies \\\"separation.\\\"  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is the reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one member of the Godhead was separated from the other two.    I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived.  She was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my \\\"girlfriend\\\" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were separated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided that she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was death.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not because He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go there.      When I rebelled against my earthly father, he spanked me.  I found no wisdom in that until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued on my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and unloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us do as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh.  You have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.     This may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.  Jesus most certainly felt the \\\"pinpricks\\\" of life.  As the Scripture say:  Heb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.  The kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes when He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine to think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  \\\"The Consciousness of Christ.\\\"  I have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study, including clh.    It is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually suffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we do.  He \\\"grew in knowledge.\\\"  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose to be taught.  It is my understanding that He was \\\"led of the Spirit\\\" to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and Jesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him, the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise.  That is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was living sequential history as you or I.    Maybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not.   I was once a member of that club.  THe \\\"free thinker\\\" is a glorious ideal.  By contrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right.  But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his \\\"rational doubt\\\" when in fact he was led to it by his \\\"faith\\\".  He must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a \\\"free thinker\\\" to criticize the Christian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize him as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.  Pascal pointed out that \\\"sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.  Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.\\\"  The fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms, hence the term \\\"a\\\"-theist.  Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In my campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember.  However, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word, every point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.  That is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out \\\"Look, your fly is undone!\\\"  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity.  The answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on presuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral.  In other words, another myth.    Presuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence.   Of course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first \\\"Highlander\\\" movie.  But again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of God.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His prophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you are to reject God's annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct understanding of Himself.\",\" Unfortunately your phrasing is ambiguous.

Anyway...)   The basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption of Mary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles  and all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were present when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days later, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was still unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There was no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed that Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their   preaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently  considered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the apostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of the assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.\",\"     The HGA isn't all that reflective in the wavelengths that might \\\"cook the focal elements\\\", nor is its figure good on those scales--the problem is that the antenna _itself_ could not be exposed to Venus-level sunlight, lest like Icarus' wings it melt.  (I think it was glues and such, as well as electronics, that they were worried about.)  Thus it had to remain furled and the axis _always_ pointed near the sun, so that the small sunshade at the tip of the antenna mast would shadow the folded HGA.

The \\\"whole Russian strategy\\\" is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano, who was GM before Murray.  What the previous GM also did was to trade  away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, most notably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years with Philly after leaving here.  Also, it's not the volume of trades that will  necessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a  great player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly to the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by  injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered).

If you don't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the BuilderXcessory file is. You can do this using the setenv command under csh. Note that the name ends in .ad so you will have to set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to {BX}/%N.ad to get the app-defaults to load correctly.

We will  ;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic ;engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want. ;No breeding, no \\\"hybrids\\\", etc.  The ethical question is, should ;we?   Two past problems with eugenics have been  1) reducing the gene pool and  2) defining the status of the eugenized.   Inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted genes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to crowd out \\\"garbage genes.\\\" This may in the future become possible. Even if it does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully mean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy later. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa and for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We don't really know what the future may hold for our environment. The reduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred domesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age, meteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc., etc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible available is a good strategy for species survival.    Of course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out as no different than anyone else's. But if we could make \\\"philosopher-kings\\\" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they) want to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their kings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually realized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while, it was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen to persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing new under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before \\\"1984.\\\"      I see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2 problems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to use any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That hasn't stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which have died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also many are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own power. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the fates of others, and have survived by making better choices when their turns came.   Not that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us off the face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global warming or whatever could and may still do that, too.    The real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don't think man has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any better than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we may not. If we don't, I hope there are reservoirs of \\\"garbage\\\" people out in some backwater with otherwise long discarded \\\"garbage\\\" genes which will pull us through.    I believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same. Man needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his lacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have, and I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God in their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue needed to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have died out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough input from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed themselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the ones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit to use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes thus far, or else haven't had enough power for long enough.    In summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new technology is really an ancient one. And the answer, in some ways hard, in some ways easy, is the same ancient answer. It isn't the power, it is the Spirit.   Sorry for the long post. Got carried away.\",\": The Swiss population is (and well was) far larger than that.

A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea()  (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles \\\"regular\\\" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a \\\"proper\\\" way to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is guaranteed to be mapped.  The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow \\\"tickle\\\" the Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.\",\"Gremilins have attacked my keyboard and the correction to my followup on audio relays got fouled up.

Even as a libertarian, I have to admit government does do some things I like.  There is a beautiful performing arts complex in Ft.  Lauderdale that was partially built with tax dollars (I don't know how much was private and how much was stolen, I mean public) but it is beautiful and I enjoy it.  (Keep in mind, though, most of the people in the city will never attend a single performance there, so they might feel differently about having to help pay for it.)  However, I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to give government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis.  In fact, we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely because it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as other issues.  Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  They do not try to decide just whether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speech should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  You can imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority on a case-by-case basis.  Not so with economic issues.  Government does tell taxi-drivers exactly what they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers.  Just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a case-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a case-by-case basis.  There is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with free enterprise.  But there is no hope, in my opinion, of having a government that interferes with free enterprise in an \\\"efficient\\\" manner; I call it political market failure.

The following letter, which represents a small portion  of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical  documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs,  was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors,  program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and  radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide  of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people  of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the  lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is  mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their  lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations  may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and  prosperously.  ------------------------- letter ----------------------------------  During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government  has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which  not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the  method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day,  Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order  to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland,  which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia  continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:  1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility.  2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism  Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish  Genocide.  3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to  silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.  4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.  Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government  is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.  Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its  terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks  to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically  exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on  this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of  governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition  of the Turkish Genocide.  With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial demands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims of the Turkish Genocide demand:  1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian  Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;  2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and Kurdish people;  3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for  their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;  4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian political pressure;  5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it  has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially  recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be  supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;  6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact  of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of  2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.  The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first  genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new  generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically mature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through all necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the  armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon all Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in  the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.

First, God has given the proto-evangel in Genesis 3.15, which is the first promise of a savior, who will redeem mankind from the wiles of Satan. \\\"[Satan] was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in the truth because there is no truth in him.\\\" John 8.44.  Now the proto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and \\\"the woman\\\", and enmity between Satan and \\\"her seed.\\\"  Now the woman is both Eve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve.  \\\"Her seed\\\" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in the same way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing as we do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that Mary is also sinless because if she wasn't she would 1) not be at enmity with the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her sinlessness to Christ's sinlessness would be called into question, as would God's veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and the serpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved.     Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the Archangle Gabriel \\\"full of grace.\\\"  As I pointed out above this is from the Greek word \\\"Kecharitomene\\\" which means not just full of grace, but a plenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped by the footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, \\\"Hail you who have been and reamin filled with grace.\\\"  But that is a little to long to say, so it is reduced to full of grace.  And as it says, \\\"you who have been\\\" Mary had always been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which was also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later.     It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done what the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And if God could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his Mother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which the Fathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo , St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of Christian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on the matter in \\\"Ineffibilus Deus.\\\"\",\"       Rob,  their e-mail adress is support@asymetrix.com  I've heard V.2.0 is in beta.  have a look at bitserv.list.toolb-l - which is a toolbook list.\",\" Another way would be to use GetGeometry to find out where you are relative to the frame, and TranslateCoordinates to find out where your window's upperleft corner really is.  -- Ethan   \",\"I was wrong!

I've been following this group for about four months now, and I don't recall ever seeing such a flood of posts that a split would be warranted.  Just my 2 cents,\",\"I'm working upon a game using an isometric perspective, similar to that used in Populous.  Basically, you look into a room that looks similar to the following:                               xxxx                          xxxxx   xxxx                      xxxx    x       xxxx                  xxxx        x           xxxx              xxxx     2      xxxx     1      xxxx              x           xxxx    xxxx           x              x       xxxx            xxxx       x              x   xxxx             o      xxxx   x              xxxx              3 /|\\\\         xxxx                  xxxx            /~\\\\     xxxx                      xxxx            xxxx                          xxxx    xxxx                              xxxx  The good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move around in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision. [*]  Since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded for a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two's rising edge has a slope of 1/4. (I'm also using Mode X, 320x240).  I've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried this before, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:  1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a packed->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the \\\"jaggies.\\\"  I'm now considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary). Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed, thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?  2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort the original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed. Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape?  Currently I take:    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16  17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32  33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48  49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64  and produce:                           1  2  3  4 33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8 49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12             53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16                         57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32                                     61 62 63 64  Line 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1. Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3. This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But it causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way? Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed?  Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective? I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering. Locations are stored in (x,y,z) form.  [*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1) *are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to be an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points. This simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have to change size as they move about in the room).  I've decided that this approximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective drawing.  Hopefully the \\\"context\\\" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches hanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.  Thanks in advance for any help. \",\"Is anyone familiar with Doug Sturm?\",\"Sounds similar to something Wally Schirra said.\",\"  Gosh, Jesse is that famous now?  He was my intern.

I hope that I will live to see the day we walk on Mars, but we need to address the technical hurdles first!

It's the one who knows what he's doing, and why, that will be faster.  It *may* be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is, through trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology. Only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one improve on that technique (I hold that this applies to any human endeavor).   Do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd? Are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or decrease available traction?  Braking?  It is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum swerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques.  For most of his riding life this may not be a problem, but in an emergency situation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage.   I disagree.  The existance and immense success of riding courses which teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner that is neither confusing, nor detracts from any other aspects of the course.   Perhaps, but in the ensuing discussion, you strayed far from that point, to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a rider's ability.  I find this assertion ludicrous. \",\"  Roberts played in last night game against the Sharks and got a goal (38th) and an assist.  This definitely bolsters Calgary's chances in the playoffs.

The NEC Adapter does not do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal into the correct pinout but do not switch the Macs output into VGA mode.  Do I have to make one of these or does someone already have one made-up??  The following is the Apple spec for the LC cpu VGA Cable adapter. I'm assuming that the Powerbooks/Duos will work with the same adapter(?);   Macintosh LC to VGA   The Macintosh LC can supply a 640 x 480, VGA timed signal for use with VGA monitors by using an adapter cable.  The standard Macintosh LC supports VGA to 16 colors, and with the optional 512K VRAM SIMM, the VGA monitor is supported to 256 colors.   Note:     The Macintosh LC supplies signals capable of driving TTL level           inputs.  However, some low impedance input VGA monitors do not work           with the Macintosh LC.   To connect a Macintosh LC to a VGA monitor, you need to make an adapter cable from the Macintosh LC video connector to the VGA monitor.  Following is the pinout description for the adapter cable:   Macintosh LC        VGA Video Connector     Pin     Signal Name ---------------     ----    ----------- 1                   6       Red ground 2                   1       Red video signal 5                   2       Green video signal 6                   7       Green ground 9                   3       Blue video signal 13                  8       Blue ground 15                  13      /HSYNC 12                  14      /VSYNC 14                  10      HSYNC ground 7,10                nc      SENSE1 & SENSE2 tied together   VGA monitors are identified by shorting pin 7 to pin 10 on the Macintosh LC video connector.
