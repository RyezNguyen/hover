 It's really not that hard to do.  There are books out there which explain everything, and the basic 3D functions, translation, rotation, shading, and hidden line removal are pretty easy.  I wrote a program in a few weeks witht he help of a book, and would be happy to give you my source.  Also, Quickdraw has a lot of 3D functions built in, and Think pascal can access them, and I would expect that THINK C could as well.  If you can find out how to use the Quickdraw graphics library, it would be an excellent choice, since it has a lot of stuff, and is built into the Mac, so should be fast.  Libertarian, atheist, semi-anarchal Techno-Rat.\",\" So, your opinion is truth.  I see...  :-)   You can believe that if you wish.  It is undeniable, however, that people  have left the compound unharmed and alive earier in the standoff.  And since their leader was preaching that they would have an apocalypse, you  can not say undeniably that there wouldn't have been a mass suicide if the  FBI had simply stayed outside and waited another 51 days.   I am the heartless bleeding heart?  You are not making sense. You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this  compound when they had 51 days to let them out.  That sounds pretty heartless  to me.  I just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadn't  stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh.  This makes me  sad and sick.   Have you ever heard of Jonestown? The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority  worshipers and their only authority was Koresh/Howell.   If these  people were able to think for themselves, there would likely be a lot  more survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as  last year.   By all means, the FBI should be investigated, too.   BTW, I thought the second ammendment was God.  :-)   \",\"I am having a problem with the high order bit of a character being  clipped when entered in an xterm window under motif. I have reprogrammed the F1 key to transmit a <ff> <be> character sequence by using the following line in .Xdefaults:  ~Ctrl ~Shift ~Alt <Key> F1 : string(0xff) string(0xbe) \\\\n\\\\  I merge in this line with xrdb -merge and then create the new xterm which has the remapped F1 key. The problem that arises is that the  application which is recieving input at the time only sees a <7f> <3e> sequence, which is <ff> <be> with the high order bit of each character being filtered or ignored.  When I run xev and press the F1 key, I get the correct value showing  up in the following two key events:    KeyPress event, serial 14, synthetic NO, window 0x2800001,   root 0x28, subw 0x0, time 2067815294, (67,80), root:(74,104),   state 0x0, keycode 16 (keysym 0xffbe, F1), same_screen YES,   XLookupString gives 0 characters:  \\\"\\\"    KeyRelease event, serial 16, synthetic NO, window 0x2800001,   root 0x28, subw 0x0, time 2067815406, (67,80), root:(74,104),   state 0x0, keycode 16 (keysym 0xffbe, F1), same_screen YES,   XLookupString gives 0 characters:  \\\"\\\"  Notice that the keysym being transmitted is correct; 0xffbe. But when I use the F1 key while in vi or in a program I wrote to  spit back the hex values of keyboard input, I only get <7f> <3e>.  Does anyone know why the high order bit is being filtered and what I can do to make sure that the entire 8bits make it through to the final application? Any help is greatly appreciated.  Please *email* any responses.\",\"Dear fellow netters,  From time to time a term like 'Oneness Pentecostals' (or something similar) has occurred in posts to this group. I also know that there is a movement called something like 'Jesus alone.'   I believe in the Trinity and have no plans to change that, but reently I was made aware that there is at least one person within our church who holds the view that there is no trinity. In the near future we will discuss this item, and I feel that I shall ask you, my friends on this group, for background information.  Can anybody tell me the basic reasons for holding a belief that there is only Jesus? And vice versa: The foundations for the Trinity?  I shall appreciate both quotes from the Bible and historical development.  Thank you all.  In Him,  Bjorn\",\"Just a quick summary of recent findings re. high speed modems. Top three contenders seem to be AT&T Paradyne, ZyXEL, and US Robotics. ZyXEL has the biggest \\\"cult following\\\", and can be had for under $300, but I ignored it because I need something with Mac software, which will work without any tweaking.  The AT&T Dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability. They are backordered at the moment, probably because of the special $299 price in effect until May. Its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two modems. WARNING: AT&T ads say that the modem comes with a Mac kit (cables & all), and has lifetime warranty. This applies *only* when you order directly from Paradyne! I called ElekTek (one of the distributors), and they wanted to charge me $16 for cable, and gave only 1 year warranty...  USR Sportster for the Mac is also highly (but not as highly) recommended; it's only $250 from ClubMac, and if you are willing to roll your own cable and don't care about the FAXstf software, you can get the generic model from PC outlets for $190.  All this assuming that you don't have a rich uncle, and can't afford a Motorola Codex...  :-(    I ended up ordering the Dataport; we'll see how it works in two weeks or so. \",\"In <julkunen.734086202@messi.uku.fi> julkunen@messi.uku.fi (Antero   It's got potential.

The setup is as follows:          lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0    -   xsetroot -bitmap ... etc         ~user/.xsession         -   xsetroot .... etc                                     tvtwm       There are also .tvtwmrc and .Xdefaults files in the (~user) home      directory.       The xsetroot in Xsetup_0 displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm      login window as expected - very nice!       Unfortunately, when the users session is started, the background of the      tvtwm window reverts to grey.  If I manually type xsetroot... in an      xterm window when the session has started, the background is changed as      expected.       The question is: How do I retain the background from the login window      and/or specify a new background on a per-user basis as part of the      the users session startup?   ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10, not all of the keys are recognised      and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.       ie: real key       key shown on screen          ------------   -------------------          hash           back slash          tilde          pipe          double quote   at symbol          pound          hash          cursor key     not recognised       This is very annoying!  Is X at fault here or the machine setup?  I have      installed the xterm drivers that came with X11R5 in both terminfo and      termcap as they seemed more uptodate.       Typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm - as      expected!    Any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated!    Thanks,  Dave.\",\" If you are interested in a program which is very easy to use, I strongly  suggest Approach 2.0.  It is extremely easy to use, make reports, etc.  I own both it and Paradox, and I almost never use Paradox.  If you need to  build up a complicated application, then Paradox is the way to go.  I have heard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic. Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/ home use and you have not used a database before), I recommend Approach.  I  have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily: I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must  be different than what is the logical ordering.  To permanently reorder (to  use the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records  appropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order) exporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach  database), and then copying the exported files back to the original  filename.  This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really  like about Approach.  It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than  the loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load).

following features:   - Electric Start  - 26 inch cut  - Double Rear Baggers  - New Battery  - New Engine (one year old)  - Inflatable Tires (gives nice ride)  - Cushioned Seat (gives nice ride)   I am moving into a house that has a  small area of grass to cut and does not  require such large mower. The engine was  replaced, not rebuilt, last year due to  some faulty work done by a lawn mower  repair shop.\",\"      Have you checked: 1/ The setting of drive A: to 1.44 M floppy.       2/ The setting of drive B: to 1.2 M foppy.       3/ The cable connecting the two drives to       the controller card (I can't remember which       two wires are swapped, but they determine       which is drive A: & b:).  I hope this is of some help :-)   Steve\",\" Yo' Joe, why don't you post what you really think?  If there are any rational BMWMOA folks left out there, may the rest of us please have a brief summary of the current state of affairs in your esteemed organization, together with an historical outline of how you got to the above contretemps?  Points will be deducted for shouting or bulging veins in the temple area.\",\"   And the Commonwealth of Virginia has not exactly butted against the issue on those grounds.  The claim is that AS A MATTER OF TRAFFIC SAFETY one is not allowed to have a functioning radar detector on the dashboard while operating a motor vehicle.   Yes, the argument is bogus, BUT... it hasn't been successfully challenged in court.  Yet.\",\" I have a Centris 610 & want to get an IBM machine as well. To save space on my desk, I would like to use one monitor for both, with a switch-box. Does anyone know of a way to do this?  \",\"Bobby Bonilla supposedly use the word 'faggot' when he got mad at that author in the clubhouse.  Should he be banned from baseball for a year like Schott? \",\"    Foolish me.  And here I thought it had something to do with the  fact that they were hitting against Wakefield, who had no \\\"kncukle\\\" to his ball that day, and Otto, who has no stuff.

I don't see one construvtive word here.  If you don't have anything constructive to add, why waste the bandwidth - yeah, sure, flame me for doing it myself.  Is this sci.med or alt.flame?  Like it or not, medical science does *not* know categorically everything about everything.  I'm not flaming your knowledge, just asking you to sit back and ask yourself \\\"what if?\\\"  \\\"Minds are like parachutes - they only function when they are open.\\\"  Oh - and if you *do* want to flame me or anyone else, how about using email?  Rob Who doesn't claim any relevant qualifications, just interest --\",\" USUALLY....go enough places and you'll see stuff happen you didn't think did. \",\"  No... you can do this? Really? The other morning I went to do a lane change on the freeway and looked in my mirror, theer was a car there, but far enough behind. I looked again about 3-5 seconds later, car still in same position, i.e. not accelerating. I triple check with a head turn and decide I have plenty of room, so I do it, accelerating. I travel about 1/4 mile staying ~200 feet off teh bumper of the car ahead, and I do a casual mirror check. This guy is RIGHT on my tail, I mean you couldn't stick a hair between my tire & his fender. I keep looking in the mirror at him a,d slowly let off teh throttle. He stays there until I had lost about 15mph and then comes around me and cuts me off big time. I follow him for about 10 miles and finally get bored and turn back into work.   I can file a complaint about this? And actually have the chance to have something done? How? Who? Where?  jim\",\"Anybody seen mouse cursor distortion running the Diamond 1024x768x256 driver?

Tzeng\",\"On the subject of CS/CN/tear gas: when I received my initial introduction to tear gas, the first thing that came to mind was the location of the exit.  If there had been anything in the way, corners to negotiate, doors to open, or  any other obstacles to movement, I would have had a difficult time exiting the chamber.  And any concentration of tear gas is hazardous to individuals with respiratory problems, and the wearing of soft contact lenses in a tear gas  contaminated area is considered a REAL BAD IDEA.  So hoping the BD's would peaceably come strolling out the door after being gassed is a bit unrealistic. If they could have found the door, having them staggering out retching wouldn't be too far fetched.  Throw in the factor of 50-51 days of being under siege and subject to psychological warfare, and all bets on functional abilities are off.

I would have called my sources for the latest but they are all out of town (in NM).  As for the future, there is at least $5M in next years budget for work on SSRT. They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to have some. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital prototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for another year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with major modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a set of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.  Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of this program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next year for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.

One time a friend of mine at Sun sent me an e-mail.  He composed it using the Sun OpenWindows 3 \\\"mailtool\\\" which handles (non-MIME) \\\"attachments\\\" and the like.  Since I don't use \\\"mailtool\\\", I had to manually save it, cut & paste, and then \\\"uudecode\\\" the actual attachment.  What I got - after a not-inconsiderable amount of time spent doing this - was an audio file.  The original message was over 32Kb of mail headers and uuencoded data; the resulting audio message was a single sentence that I transcribed as a 135 character message.  If he had sent me the sentence in plain text, the e-mail would have been around 250 bytes, and it would have taken me about 3 seconds to process it at most.  Instead, it was 32k and it took at least a minute.  A complete waste of (my) time and bandwidth, as far as I'm concerned.  Sending plain text is still the most efficient method of transmission, given the same transport mechanism.

The story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to get the safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has  aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.  The inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a waiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book and said \\\"It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now.\\\" Well, won't argue with that...  Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the tint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the library).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't get in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.  So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer? I called the station  later on today, but they basically said there is no place where I could register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?  Any comments about it will be welcome!\",\"I keep finding these programmers in local junk shops.

Ask yourself this.  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least partially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly evaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released) The answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't.  There is other hardware out there not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.)  My suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper systems.  If not we're in trouble.  Given that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like to think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this. They know their initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never taken seriously.  The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You know little about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step in the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banning or SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the \\\"Clipper\\\" system is easily justified \\\"Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying to subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternative so use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever.\\\" How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system the only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can't, and the administration knows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for drug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.  Don't sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid. Either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations collective I.Q. is about that of a potato.  Why do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big, and NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it, noone will buy the stuff that doesn't have to.  AT&T must know this too, THINK MAN, why the hell would they jump the gun?   I really wonder.  To wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton:  The White House Office of the Press Secretary c/o: Presidential Comment Line (fax) (202) 456-2461   April 17, 1993   Sir and/or Madam:     I must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and cryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.   It is apparent to me that those who drafted the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \\\"Big Brother Proposal\\\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep      ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \\\"experts\\\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.   In addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \\\"tamper proof\\\" the key escrows might be.   I cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti      lize the \\\"Big Brother Chip.\\\"   Unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like \\\"harmony,\\\" \\\"right to encryption,\\\" and \\\"voluntary.\\\"   It mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is \\\"I can't believe it's happening here.\\\"  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; \\\"When is the Reichstag fire planned for?\\\"           Most Concerned,         [Signature]       Shaen Logan Bernhardt I uni@acs.bu.edu \",\"1992-93 Los Angeles Kings Schedule/Results  TV: --- 2 preseason games, 82 of 84 regular season and all playoffs on TV.

Kings\",\"   Typical statement from an irrational and brainwashed person. The bible was written by some male chavnist thousands of years ago (as were all of the \\\"holy\\\" books). Follow the parts that you think are suitable for modern life. Ignore the others. For heaven's (!) sake don't take it literally.      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   So you think it is easy to be a Muslim? Or be a Buddhist? The Buddha's commandments are 500 yrs older than Christ's and in my opinion tougher to follow. Moreover the Buddha says that we are  intrinsically good (as against Christ's \\\"we are all sinners\\\").  Only we allow ourselves to be distracted. By meditating we can awaken  ourselves (etc etc). Also there is no concept of God in Buddhism.  (In my opinion you can be an Atheist and a Buddhist). But to \\\"awaken\\\" yourself is no easy task. Can you stay away from eating meat? Can you sit still and think of nothing (meditate) for sometime everyday? Buddhists do (or are supposed to). Can you pray five times a day?  Can you fast for a month every year (Ramzan). Are you willing to give 1/6 th of your income as tithe? Muslims do. In fact I think  Jesus was an ordinary man (just as Buddha and Mohamed) probably with a  philosopy ahead of the times (where he lived).  Considering the fact that Christianity is a young religion (compared to Hindiusm, Judaism, Zorasterism, Buddihsm) it is also very probable that the Bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideas. (There was a good deal of trade between the eastern lands and the middle east at the time of Christ). And perhaps some more. But leave the crap in it out (\\\"woman was created after man, to be his helper\\\" etc). aras       When ever I turn on my TV there is this Pat Robertson and other brain washers (Oh boy, what an act they put on!) with an 1-800 number to turn in your pledges. God it seems is alive and well inside these boxes.  \",\"Yesterday, I got the chance to hear Kurt Vonnegut speak at the University of New Hampshire. Vonnegut succeeded Isaac Asimov as the  (honorary?) head of the American Humanist Association. (Vonnegut is an atheist, and so was Asimov) Before Asimov's funeral, Vonnegut stood up and said about Asimov, \\\"He's in heaven now,\\\" which ignited uproarious  laughter in the room. (from the people he was speaking to around the time of the funeral)    \\\"It's the funniest thing I could have possibly said to a room full of humanists,\\\" Vonnegut said at yesterday's lecture.            If Vonnegut comes to speak at your university, I highly recommend going to see him even if you've never read any of his novels. In my opinion, he's the greatest living humorist. (greatest living humanist humorist as well)      Peace,\",\"    This should be in the FAQ, it only get asked about twenty times a month  There is *NO*, that's right, *NO* telnet access to Compuserve, no ftp access, no gopher access....no Internet services except e-mail.

Has   anybody taped it VHS, and could they be persuaded to lend it to me after they   watch it?  I would be most greatful. -- \",\" That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.  If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast, DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.  Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee can and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified later against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some secure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without it being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again. (Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee members can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which you have to XOR together to recover the program...  Seriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the people who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game and the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not going to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility is the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied about the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence of other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will believe that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys. If they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem, no one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.  That isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things anyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem with a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took for folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just such reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to a Senator...).   I don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do. However -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same escrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure, they can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.  I still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.  I thought I had seen something about them being constant, but I just reread Denning's technical information post, and it doesn't say anything, one way or the other. \",\" This must have been in the works for some time.

Although I don't own the HP Portable Deskjet, I *do* own the HP Deskjet 500.  It gives the nicest outputs, with only a minor loss of quality.

Only one grudge, the ink that HP gives you does smudge rather quickly in the presence of moisture (Even though the ink is waterproof).  However, you would have to spend about $500 more for laser quality.  The cannon bubblejets are nice, however they don't seem to have as much support (eg: drivers for popular programs) as the HP ink-jets. Also HP Deskjet (regular,plus,500,500c) accepts xerox paper (I believe that the cut-sheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet).  If you don't mind refilling your printer with cheap ink (say fountain-pen ink), then the HP deskjets are *very* cheap to maintain (I paid $3.50 for my last bottle of ink and I expect it to last 9 months).    -Kimball (who doesn't work for HP, but just loves his printer     very much!)\",\":  :  1) Monitor my phonecalls. :  2) Monitor usenet. :  3) Provide only cryptosystems they can easily crack. :  4) etc etc. :  :  This is not to say that they *don't*, they might.

Let's start with looking at the professionals, the NSA itself. Its birth was by secret executive order by Harry S Truman in 1952.  Until even 1976 not even one word of this executive order chartering the NSA was sealed.  Paranoia, right?  On the outside of the NSA complex is a ten foot Cyclone fence with multiple rows of barbed wire, with high voltage, complete with signs prohibiting even making sketches under penalty of the Internal Security Act.  The area is completely scanned by closed circuit television.  More paranoia.  These are professionals,  Maybe they know something we don't, eh?  Do you think it would have helped Admiral Yamamoto if the Japanese had been a little more 'paranoid' of their purple cipher?  Or maybe the Germans should have been a little more 'paranoid' about their Engima with respect to Turing and the British.  How about the cracking of the Zimmerman telegram?  Would a little more paranoia have helped the Germans here?  Maybe the NSA should have been a little more 'paranoid' about Emma Woikin, or Joseph Sidney Petersen, Jr., or  ...  Maybe you want to talk about Macmillan publishers cooperation with the CIA and NSA to suppress Yardley's Japanese Diplomatic Secrets or even Kahn's The Codebreakers.. paranoia, right?  The most popular cipher systems in captured soviet spies was the one-time pad, even with the necessity of keeping incriminating evidence about, is known to be the only proven unbreakable system. Soviet paranoia, right?  And what do you think the NSA does with its Wullenwebers?  And  huge Rhombics pointed embassy row?  And their sites near satellite uplink and downlink sites?  Duh.  When I worked in a classified MITRE communications lab at one time even with a \\\"secret\\\" clearance I had to be escorted to the toilet and the entire site was built INTO a Mosler-type vault with *very* thick bomb-proof door.  MITRE paranoia?  I could cite probably a hundred more facts which all support, as best hypothesis, the notion that the NSA is grabbing as much as it can, as fast as it can.  One would be a fool to ignore the pattern of facts and conclude that they were random...  And we know the government is violent -- even against children as recent events prove.  Judge William Sessions is a disgrace but a solemn warning to those who ignore the web of evidence that our government institutions have in their contempt for our civil rights.  And of course we have to err somewhat on the excessive side of caution because that does much less harm than erring on the reckless side. As member of the crew of the USS Liberty might aver.  I might suggest, Andrew, that you read Kahn's Codebreakers and Bamford's Puzzle Palace and come back with some more facts to support your sheepish acquiescence to authority.  \",\" |> >  |> >>To sum up, when an accelerated board with 4MB VRAM (True Colour 1280x1024)  |> >>AND A FAST VGA SIDE is available under $500, I will buy one.

Several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography. Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other algorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something like DES) for the encryption.  How could the \\\"back door\\\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few possibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door keys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers used in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.  Another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips simply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own internal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys usable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's secret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be identical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most straightforward to me.)  Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the message itself has a \\\"dual key\\\" property, that possession of either of two keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from the DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.  It's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and December was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would participate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early knowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with Clipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.\",\" The New York talk shows are just awful in this regard.  People are constantly calling WFAN and WABC with (stuff like) \\\"I was thinking, why don't the Yankees trade Kaminicki and Silvestri to Seattle for Ken Griffey Jr and Randy Johnson, that would really help the team\\\"  or \\\"Do you think the Yankees can get Roger  Clemens?\\\".  The show hosts are pretty good about handling these guys, but it's still annoying.  The best one was at the end of one show, a caller started out with \\\"I was  thinking, why don't the Yankees trade for...\\\" and then the host hung up on him.

Your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning. You may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the tire - so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road.  (2) Tires age. In particular, soft tire compounds get harder as you put them thru more heat cycles. Harder compounds don't grip as well as soft ones. Effect is very noticable on tires that get very hot very often, such as in competition, but it hits all tires.\",\"     In case you haven't noticed, Clintonites are pushing a universal health     care ACCESS program.  \\\"Access\\\" here means that folks who do not give      a damn about immunizing their children will have health care services     delivered to their doorsteps.   --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Disclaimer: Opinions expressed are mine, not my employer's.\",\"       What loyalty!

A definition of any type of 'phobe comes from : phobia = an irrational fear of.  Hence a homophobe (not only in ACT UP meetings, : the word is apparently in general use now.  Or perhaps it isn't in the bible?   : Wouldst thou prefer if I were to communicate with thou in bilespeak?) :  : Does an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of being a spider?  Does an : agoraphobe have an irrational fear of being a wide open space?  Do you : understand English? :  : Obviously someone who has  phobia will react to it.  They will do their best : to avoid it and if that is not possible they will either strike out or : run away.  Or do gaybashings occur because of natural processes?  People : who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or : cause them (or themselves) violence. :   Isn't that what I said ... What are you taking issue with here, your remarks are merely parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful.  : [...] :  : |> It would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function : |> (other than limiting population growth) since evolution only occurs : |> when the members of one generation pass along their traits to : |> subsequent generations. Homosexuality is an evolutionary deadend. If I : |> take your usage of the term, homophobe, in the sense you seem to : |> intend, then all men are really homosexual and evolution of our : |> species at least, is going nowhere. : |>  :  : So *every* time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children? : Hmm...no wonder the world is overpopulated.  Obviously you keep to the : Monty Python song:  \\\"Every sperm is sacred\\\".  And if, as *you* say, it has : a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is, by your own  : arguement, natural.  Consider the context, I'm talking about an evolutionary function. One of the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a species procreate, those who don't have no purpose in that context.  :  : |> Another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to : |> survive, the participation of both parents is necessary - a family must : |> exist, since homosexuals do not reproduce, they cannot constitute a : |> family.

Also the parent from single : parent families should put the babies out in the cold now, cos they must, : by your arguement, die.  By your argument, homosexuality is genetically determined. As to your second point, you prove again that you have no idea what context means. I am talking about evolution, the preservation of the species, the fundamental premise of the whole process. :  : |> But it gets worse. Since the overwhelming majority of people actually : |> -prefer- a heterosexual relationship, homosexuality is a social : |> abberation as well. The homosexual eschews the biological imperative : |> to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in : |> the most fundamental social element, the family. But wait, there's : |> more. : |>  :  : Read the above.  I expect you to have at least ten children by now, with : the family growing.  These days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly : without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure.  In pre-pill : and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children. : These days is just ain't true!  People can decide whether or not to have  : children and when.  Soon they will be able to choose it's sex &c (but that's  : another arguement...) so it's more of a \\\"lifestyle\\\" decision.  Again by : your arguement, since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must : be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children.  Both are  : as \\\"unnatural\\\" as each other.  Yet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists for procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. That homosexuals don't procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and nothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.  :  : |> Since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some : |> policy makers that they have civil rights, they are now claiming that : |> their sexuality is a preference, a life-style, an orientation, a : |> choice that should be protected by law.

Here's pretty obvious dodge, do you really think you've said anything or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement? I am not telling anyone anything, I am demonstrating that there are arguments against the practice of homosexuality (providing it's a merely an alternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonably call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. I realize of course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value, and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis, but if you are to be consistent, you have no case in this regard. :  : |> To characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to : |> ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of : |> the homosexual \\\"life-style\\\".

All your arguments are based on outdated ideals.  Likewise the : bible.  Would any honest Christian condemn the ten generations spawned by : a \\\"bastard\\\" to eternal damnation?  Or someone who crushes his penis (either : accidently or not..!).  Both are in Deuteronomy.  I'm sure your comment pertains to something, but you've disguised it so well I can't see what.

Your arguments are very reactionary; do you have anything at all to contribute?  :  : |> As to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in : |> scouting, the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from : |> teaching; by their own logic, homosexuals are deviates, social and : |> biological.

I've got a problem that  I need as many people's help from as possible.  Before I go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell you that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy meets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....Anyway...  OK, I am a 19 year old Sophmore at NCSU. About 10 years ago, my family and I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the street, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me... her name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and have been writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about 2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago.   By the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.  OK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming back to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So I drove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent the whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though we had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being in person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met. (She's one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could ask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to  mention WAY out of my league...although I'm  not unattractive mind you), but she had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family is one of those families who goes to church but that is about the extent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But she knows I am a Christian.   Well, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such a thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid you not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.  In out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding dates..(which is true for me, but I know it can't be for her). She has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended up leaving school....Now we are at the present...  Let me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....   \\\"Okay, now I'm going to try to explain my life to you. I'm not going to KU anymore because something just isn't right. College just wasn't clicking with me here. Greek life is really big here and that just isn't my way. I wasn't taking any classes that truly interested me & i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life. I was interested in something medical (Physical Therpy) & I love working with  kids, but 'it' just didn't work for me at this university. And my parents could tell.  \\\"So I'm working full time at the Bass Store [Bass shoes that is] and now I have a part-time job at a local daycare. I work in the infant room M-W-F. I've really enjoyed it so far. It spices up my week a little bit and  it's great experience.  \\\"As of now, I'm not planning on going back to school in the very near future. The main reason being my indecision on what I want to study. But I definatley plan on going back within the next couple of years. Where? I have no idea--except for one thing, it won't be to Kansas.  \\\"Right noew I'm discussing a promotion with my boss and district  manager. It looks like I'll train at the store I work at now for about 4-6 months as Assistant Manager and when that's done, I'll  basically be given a list of stores (newly or soon to be built) to  chose where i would like to manage. I've pretty much decided on either one of the Carolinas (hopeully close to the beach) Wouldn't it be fun to actually see each other more than once every few years?? What do you think abou that? I would like to know your opinion.  \\\"This job would pretty much be temporary. But it is VERY GOOD pay and any thye of management experience would look good on an application or resume. The company is solid and treats it employees very well. Good benefits, bonuses & medical plans. Plus- after 1 year of full-time service, they will reimburse tuition. I do have school money waitng for me, but this will help, especially since I will probably end up  paying out of state tuition wherever I go.  \\\"Chris, i really would like to know what you think of my decision. I  respect your opinion. I've been completely lost for what to do for  soooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really  good. I do like my job although I'm about 99.9% sure that i want to do more with my life than reatil management..but it IS something.

Since she wants to move to the Carolina's should i search out a  Bass store near here and aske her to come to Carolina???  I always pick on those people who graduate from high school and get married....but what does she mean???   I've had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that  I don't date beacause 1) No time  2) Not that much $$ 3) that most college women are wrapped up in the social scene with  the Greeks whic as a Christian I can't support-----and here she says she doesn't like the Greek thing either!!  Maybe I'm so stunned because there is actually a girl that I am so attracted to paying some real attention to me.  I mean, what if she did move to NC...what would I do??? I'm only 19 and she 20....I'm only a Sophmore struggling through classes..  I have prayed about this over the past year from time to time.. saying, \\\"God if she is the right one, let the situation open up..\\\"  Could this be my sign???  I would do ANYTHING to get her to NC...here is some moree that makes  it worse..  Should I call her?? I'm terrible over the phone. I don't even like to talk to my friends here for longer than 3 minutes.  I mean, what would a girl as perfect as her want with a very average guy like me??

In     general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three     categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent     between these networks, and other resources available on one of these     networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to     special 'servers'.      The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of     several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.      One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central     distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In     addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for     Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more     specialized mailing lists described below.      A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin     board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews     separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a     'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are     called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',     and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called     'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends     it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby     machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so     that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet     sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was     posted.      Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and     BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not     accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more     flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make     it the preferred option.  MAILING LISTS      SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the     International Space University (in only its second change of management     in over a decade).

Recursiveness has no problems, it is just horribly inefficient (just ask any assembly programmer.)   The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights, is a complete lie and deception, as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving.  Liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost,  almost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable? Similarly for right of life.  When one person must die if he is to save another, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable?   That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty,  especially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable, the serial killer, or the victim?  According to that beautiful line, those two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should be able to remove them.  This _includes_ government.  Admittedly the serial killer has restricted some people's life and/or liberty, but is not his own life/liberty inviolate also?  According to the declaration of independence, it is.   Oooh, I like that.  It means that killing an infant is not murder because it cannot be against its will.  Reason, an infant has no will as such.  Similarly for people who are brain dead (easier to see), in a coma, etc.  Also, under current law, accidental killing is still murder.  How will you include that?   The only real golden rule in life is, he who has the gold, makes the rules.  I.e. Might Makes Right.  That is survival.  Now what is wrong with that?   If you mean the golden rule as I stated, yes, almost every system as implemented has used that in reality.  Sorry, I don't deal as much in fiction, as I do in reality.     WELCOME TO OZLAND!!!!!!! :)  What is NOT arbitrary?  If you can find some part of society, some societal rules, morals, etc. that are not arbitrary, please tell me.  I don't think there are any.  Sounds like euphemisms to me.  The difference seems to be, that objective is some reasoning that I like, while arbitrary is some reasoning that I don't like OR don't understand. \",\"A \\\"new Christian\\\" wrote that he was new to the faith and  learning about it \\\"by reading the Bible, of course\\\". I am not at all sure this is the best path to follow.  While the Bible is, for Christians, the word of God, the  revelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of this revalation is the Church. I am not recommending any one denommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian congregation in which to develop your faith, rather than just reading the Bible.  This does not mean that the Bible should not be read, although I would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid the Book of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you are comfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects to read the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable lack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the really sturdy, somewhere in Chronicles.  The point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith of Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vital beliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned - the Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church organization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the lived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one hopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studies in the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading.  Following up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I  would even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the christian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing the nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction into the christian faith was brought about [after grace] through reading Graham Greene: _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greene's _Monsignor Quixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian, but such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly, I often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after reading many parts of the Bible. And that after all is what being a Christian is all about: letting your soul and your life be, in some way, directed towards the infinite, represented to us by the person of Jesus Christ.\",\": Marian CATHOLIC high school, outside of chicago: :  : 666 south ASHLAND avenue. :  Actually, Satanism is technically inverted Catholicism. \",\"We have a Sun 3/80 and we have just acquired a cg8 frame buffer card.

One you have supplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the future (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to decap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating high-profit arcade machines and the like - who wouldn't care less), I am not  going to care much about US confidentiality, am I?  Only people like the real me, who does care about travelling to various countries for business reasons, will sit up and follow laws like this, but I would contend that we're not the main threat.  I also have grave doubts whether an algorythm widely distributed in silicon could possibly be called \\\"classified.\\\"  It's like handing out military secrets to the whole world in envelopes marked \\\"don't open me.\\\"  I can imagine several credible defences which could be employed if it came to a trial.  One would be the stupidity of the government's actions.   Amusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable for a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware? In DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you just swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect on the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of that cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that it would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search algorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware. I have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.   However, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its  designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion  of such techniques seems credible.  Hmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name \\\"Clipper\\\" for this device. :) \",\" That's a typical claim, though they say they've improved compression speed considerably.

I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X, but I have not seen it myself).    Currently, I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms, of which only three came with Motif. On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available.    The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5. True, I could buy another port of Motif, but that sort of ruins the whole idea of \\\"free\\\", doesn't it?

The trouble with regulations is  that they only tell you what you are no longer permitted to do, not what  you should do instead.

(Of course the cause of  the Montreal Protocol was all the research done on the causes of the  Ozone Depletion Problem.)       Someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast  to ban the ozone-depleting (CFC) chemicals and not gasolines and other  greenhouse-gas-producing compounds.  The greenhouse effect (produced by  infrared-trapping gasses like CO2 and methane) and the ozone-hole problem  (produced by long-lived, chlorine-containing molecules) are not the same  thing.  It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's  (chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which  are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms.  Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help  the greenhouse-gas problem, but would do nothing for the ozone problem.   Fred W.

Everyone,  Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess my question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:  The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere.  This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used. The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial Standard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold internationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!! How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most importantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?  I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year to specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear) is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not analytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things complicated. Please give me a hint.  I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not. However, so many people involved in the problem \\\"sphere from 4 poits\\\". Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?

Jim -- jmd@handheld.com\",\"for SRC  In most languages, the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is known as the PASCH, or PASQUE, or some variation thereof, a word which comes from the Hebrew PESACH, meaning \\\"Passover.\\\" In English, German, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER, or some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the origin of this term.  One explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE RATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great scholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived 673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of the word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well established before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely that his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that there had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name, and the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance (surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should have a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf convincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does not make it more so.  Assuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the Christian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some centuries before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots. It would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians and beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every spring, called it by the name that to them meant simply \\\"Spring Festival.\\\"  However, Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J Knoblech, in \\\"Die Sprach,\\\" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5 (Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:  Among Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast of the Resurrection was known as \\\"hebdomada alba\\\" (white week), since the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their white baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was referred to simply as \\\"albae.\\\" Translaters rendering this into German mistook it for the plural of \\\"alba,\\\" meaning \\\"dawn.\\\" They accordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for \\\"dawn.\\\" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.

Our   three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release   that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.   On Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family   will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public   awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Bill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease   characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and   trachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would   lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.    Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis   last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her   lifetime.    Even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives   of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory   Papillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide   support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a   newsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid   in the prevention, cure, and treatment.  Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to   those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money   were available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant   attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP   Foundation's mission is to change that.   Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call   Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.

Your fascist government got away with  the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying  the fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away  with the genocide's cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in  Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem  districts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed and hundreds of civilians also perished.     Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included     the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank,    Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives,     children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians     joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan     districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of    3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished    to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to    the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and    seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell    into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims    themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels    also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the    large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from    occupying the city.     The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out    the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the    neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha's nephew alive. They    raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours'    distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them.     At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar,    Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible    atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in    the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the    neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat.     Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the    Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four    villages, including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori,    they continued to spread death and destruction among the    Muslims and other Christian communities, refusing to lay down    their arms.

Let's do it right this time!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:  [1] microgravity/vacuum process research [2] life sciences research (adaptation to space) [3] spacecraft maintenence   The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to centralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet their targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users  took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to  tie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization and miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial  users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the  constellation.    Firstly, different functions are broken down into different  constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function: thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits, comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation, providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.  SSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments and are also prime candidates for constellization.  [1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now: COMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for short-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is inexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities  on Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab to a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET. We might also expand the research program to take advantage of  interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt  or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a  station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.  [2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity, but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter of LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since astronauts will have little practical use in the space program until costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation, and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity in super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the radiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars, Earth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support machinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR interface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown, follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface, testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billions are spent on astronauts.  [3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in  Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can practice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck solar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs, inject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be spun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.  By applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we have radically improved the capability of the program while greatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag, we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study life's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety  of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose orbits.  N.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration as well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.   Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously  we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used to fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and sample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can be used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology greenhouses on Mars at low cost.  \",\"Hi,    I'd like to subscribe to Leadership Magazine but wonder if there is one on disk instead of on paper.

In case this puzzles people, I would like to expand on two of her comments.   One of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context, scope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces of evidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break the back of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to be filled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is a grave mistake to confuse these.  Past snippets from this thread:    Back to Lee Lady:   These posters are making the mistake that I have previously criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A \\\"carefully designed and controlled study\\\" is neither always possible nor always important.  (On the other hand, if someone is proposing a remedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, we have enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kind of claim to ask for a \\\"carefully designed and controlled study\\\" to alleviate our skepticism.)  Rules such as \\\"support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and controlled study\\\" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation. I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.  (To reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical problems are notoriously problematic.)  \",\"Storage space for sale:          Iomega 44 MB removeable HD for sale w/ 16 cartridges.

The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits  for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution.   The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed  unsafe under federal air quality laws.        \\\"People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to  exacerbate that inflammation,\\\" said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental  Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  \\\"When people are on  the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over  the edge.\\\"       The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits  with daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter  of 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because  they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of  compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10  exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.        In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at  levels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30  microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with  asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.        The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory  Disease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung  Association's medical section.        The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that  particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study  by Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles  may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.   Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms  and bronchitis in children.        \\\"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\\\"  says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"But more and more research is showing that particles are  bad actors as well.\\\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate  air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated  pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex  and varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  acid aerosols.        \\\"Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects  of particulate air pollution,\\\" says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"We have no way of  duplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  \\\" Consequently, most of what  is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research  like the Seattle study.        Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur  dioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any  time soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with  asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.      \\\"In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only  cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's  rarely particulate matter,\\\" says Dr.  Schwartz.  \\\"However, PM10 doesn't have  to be near its violation range to be unhealthy.\\\"                                HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993                 NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma  The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on  Diagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in  dermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance  techniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care  professionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological  characteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management,  and followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi  and their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in  preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.  Following 2 days of  presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel  weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement.    Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a  distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins;  (2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential  for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical  excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and  extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4)  patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high  risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely;  (5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for  melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education  and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality  from melanoma.

Within the program, there are four types  of cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily  in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on  clinical research; \\\"comprehensive\\\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a  multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community  outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer  prevention and control research.    Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was  the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new  cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage  of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened  the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and  cancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew  progressively.    In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today,  there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria  for comprehensive status.    To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an  institution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly  established in 1990, the eight criteria for \\\"comprehensiveness\\\" include the  requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in  several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong  program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings  into clinical practice.    Moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly  beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also  referred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting  the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass  strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials,  significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important  outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of  sources.    The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and  capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit  important new findings or address timely research questions.

These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers  engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators  and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications  from new discoveries in the laboratory.    Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and  clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently  incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their  overall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today.    Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely  structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and  control research.  These centers interface with state and local public health  departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention  and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions  responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.   Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with  institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community  hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials.    Together, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward  creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through  interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the  laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

Specifically, we are interested in establishing this site as a clearinghouse  for personally developed software that has been developed for local medical  education programs.  We welcome all contributions that may be shared with  other users.    To connect to the UCI Medical Education Software Repository, ftp to:                        FTP.UCI.EDU  The Repository currently offers both MSDOS and Macintosh software, and we hope  to support other operating systems (UNIX, MUMPS, AMIGA?).    Uploads are welcome.  We actively solicit information and software which you  have personaly developed or have found useful in your local medical education  efforts, either as an instructor or student.    Once you have connected to the site via FTP, cd (change directory) to either  the med-ed/mac/incoming or the med-ed/msdos/incoming directories, change the  mode to binary and \\\"send\\\" or \\\"put\\\" your files.  Note that you won't be able to  see the files with the \\\"ls\\\" or \\\"dir\\\" commands.  Please compress your files as  appropriate to the operating system (ZIP for MSDOS; Compactor or something  similar for Macintosh) to save disk space.    After uploading, please send email to Steve Clancy (slclancy@uci.edu) (for  MSDOS) or Albert Saisho (saisho@uci.edu) (for MAC) describing the file(s) you  have uploaded and any other information we might need to describe it.

The  decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to  test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of  Health, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and   Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the  therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies  including Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH  that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is  intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the   replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's  reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the  MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.   \\\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the  next 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\\\" said Shalala.    Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine  Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had  convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested  simultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of  multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two  years.  ==================================================================       HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  \\\"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV\\\" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol.  114, No. 14, P. 18        AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was  approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome,  the manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the  drug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that  although HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk  of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit   disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of  the three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the  drug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S.  researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials,  many argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients  experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of   AIDS symptoms.

Regards, Martin Erzberger \",\" (WEBSTER:  myth:  \\\"a traditional or legendary story...            ...a belief...whose truth is accepted uncritically.\\\")  How does that qualify? Indeed, it's almost oxymoronic...a rather amusing instance. I've found that most atheists hold almost no atheist-views as \\\"accepted uncritically,\\\" especially the few that are legend. Many are trying to explain basic truths, as myths do, but they don't meet the other criterions. Also...   You accuse him of referencing mythology, then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology.  (This time meeting all the requirements of myth.)   Ah, but not everyone \\\"knows\\\" that god exists.  So you have a fallacy.   And that makes it true?  Holding with the Bible rules out controversy? Read the FAQ.  If you've read it, you missed something, so re-read. (Not a bad suggestion for anyone...I re-read it just before this.)   ...should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting it across?  You may trust the Bible, but your trusting it doesn't make it any more credible to me.  If the Bible says that everyone knows, that's clearly reason to doubt the Bible, because not everyone \\\"knows\\\" your alleged god's alleged existance.   1) No, they don't have to ignore the Bible.  The Bible is far from universally accepted.  The Bible is NOT a proof of god; it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god.  (Or does it prove even that?  They might have been writing it as series of fiction short-stories.  As in the case of Dionetics.)  Assuming the writers believed it, the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it. And that's ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and Biblical-philosophers were correct.  2) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible.  3) Again, read the FAQ.   Bzzt...wrong answer! Gravity is directly THERE.  It doesn't stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it.  God, on the other hand, doesn't generally show up in the supermarket, except on the tabloids.  God doesn't exert a rationally undeniable influence. Gravity is obvious; gods aren't.   No, human reason hasn't always come back to the existance of \\\"God\\\"; it has usually come back to the existance of \\\"god\\\". In other words, it doesn't generally come back to the xtian god, it comes back to whether there is any god.  And, in much of oriental philosophic history, it generally doesn't pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there.  From a world-wide view, human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be and/or what force(s) are currently in control.  A natural tendancy to believe in \\\"God\\\" only exists in religious wishful thinking.   Xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions, and it's reasonableness certainly doesn't merit eminence. Divine justice...well, it only seems just to those who already believe in the divinity. First, not all atheists believe the same things about human nature. Second, whether most atheists are correct or not, YOU certainly are not correct on human nature.  You are, at the least, basing your views on a completely eurocentric approach.

The 56th Ariane launch is now scheduled to place the ASTRA 1C and ARSENE  satellites into an improved geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), with  inclination reduced to 5 degrees and apogee altitude increased by 150 km. This will be the 28th launch of an Ariane 4 and the first in the 42L  configuration, with 2 liquid strap-on boosters (PAL).  It will be launched from the newly refurbished Ariane launch complex ELA 2, in Kourou - French  Guiana.  The launch vehicle performance requirement for this mission is 3,147 kg of which 2,944 kg represents the satellite mass.  The total vehicle mass at liftoff is 361,778 kg.

This is a three-stage liquid fueled launcher with two liquid  fueled strap-on boosters.  The first stage (L220) is built by Aerospatiale, and is powered by 4 liquid fueled Viking V engines.  The second stage (L33) is built by MBB Erno and is powered by a single Viking IV engine.  Both the Viking IV and V engines are manufactured by SEP.  The first and second stages use a biliquid UH25/N2O4 fuel. The third stage (H10) is built by Aerospatiale, and is powered by a cryogenic H2/O2 fueled HM-7B engine built by SEP. The two strap-on boosters (PAL) are each powered by a Viking VI engine, also built  by SEP, which use the same biliquid fuel as the first and second stages.   The fully assembled launch vehicle stands 56 meters high on the pad.   It uses the Type 01 Ariane Short payload fairing.

When they commit fully to each other as life partners, they are married.  The ceremony may assist in emphasizing the depth of such a commitment, but is of itself nothing. God knows our hearts.  He knows when two have committed themselves to be one, he knows the fears and delusions we have that keep us from fully giving ourselves to another.  The way I see it, you'd have to be living together in a marriage for somewhere between 10 and 100 years before anyone knew if a marriage really existed, but God knows.

It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is  16 Mbits a second. [...]   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips  N, a 30-bit serial number  U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted    with the chip  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then  fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:        E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and      E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    Three questions: 1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output:   E[M;K] = 64 bits   E[K;U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bits   E[ E[K;U], N ; F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits    Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time,    or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning?       All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications    like cellular phones (or even regular phones over   2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output?    Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,    or also to the wiretap block?  Or, if the wiretap block is only    transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into    everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode?  3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself?    Does the block have to be present at all?    Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U,    it presumably can't check the validity of E[K;U], so it's     limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,    and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness    (unless there's some sort of back-door structure that lets    it recognize a valid E[K;U].)        In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT    wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention?    (The chip won't do it, so you postprocess the output.)    Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key;    paranoid people can use someone else's serial number.     On the other hand, if I could think of that solution so easily,    presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,    like use message encryption that's really E[M; K,U,N] ?    Thanks!\",\"  Sooner than you expect. Remember 'Cyprus'?   Too bad. In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established  a vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two  continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and  Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in  espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and  Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under  German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National  Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional  Record,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic,  Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often  expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary, during World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]  \\\"Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)  when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it   becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon  method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical  operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing.\\\"   Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews - extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San Francisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.   \\\"...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities   against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the    murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian    neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish    and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see    the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...   Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise    to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would    help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of   the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.

The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the   maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the  characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility  in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font  file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters  appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on.  Well, yes, both Type 1 and TrueType fonts can contain lots of characters. And in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to Windows ANSI in Windows, and to Mac standard roman encoding on the Mac.  No difference there between T1 and TT!     And as for fonts with thousands of glyphs, right know these are a liabiliaty rather than a great new thing.  Reason is that a font with 3000 characters is very large, and if you can only access 224 of them you are paying a heavy price in downloading time and printer storage.  (And at the moment there is only one program of that uses `partial font downloading')   For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows  char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font  is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac  char set.    Yes and T1 text fonts all have the `ISO Adobe' character set, which is a superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding.  The question is whether you can get at the glyphs.  In Windows, for example, you cannot get at the ligatures `fi' anfd `fl' (both T1 and TT)even though a font may very well have them.  ANd, while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type 1 font and to create a new Windows metric file (PFM) for it, there are utilities out there to allow you do this.  How do I reencode a TrueType font?  How can I get at the `fi' and `fl' ligatures in Windows (or on the Mac)?  Are there utilities that make it possible to circumvent the hard-wired Windows ANSI encoding?      > Regards,                                            1001-A East Harmony Road    > Bob Niland                                          Suite 503    > Internet:  rjn@csn.org                              Fort Collins CO 80525    > CompuServe: 71044,2124                              (303) 223-5209 \",\" How about those toneau covers?

By trying to inject the notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without adding any insight whatever.  The same parallel question could be \\\"Is a polydactyl person a human being?\\\"  You still have not answered what you mean by human being.  Please do so.   You won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies. If you want a definition of human being that does not depend on the vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule, provide it for me.   More irrelevancies.  As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does not follow your version of human being.  And as he pointed out, brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights of the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant difference.  What I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the thread you started?  You got answers to your questions when you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some ridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected, changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion of substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance, why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss silly accussations, e.g. \\\"It really doesn't matter to you...\\\" If it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek some substance?  You're not going to convince a logical person of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic and show some meaning to your words.   As others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on which has the better chance at survival.  Again, your analogy fails.  Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here. A woman's womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would not be granted a born human being.  Was that due to its inconvenience?   Is it?  Please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling.   You simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is not accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on for size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments. But the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The systems are dependent on each other for life.  I'm still struggling to see anything analagous here and failing to do so.   Your argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total failure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in reality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible, that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said, you give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe in now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where they cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said, there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim that is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a claim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to its claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?   You haven't answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.   Again you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and it is not as slow as you seem to think.   Yes, and I'd hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn's children that he was murdered by a religious, \\\"pro-life\\\" fanatic.  Please do try to stay relevant.   Clever comeback.  I congratulate you on the readiness of your wit.  What happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake? Why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  What is different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at stake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction are irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction anyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have borne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at parties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.\",\" Gee, what do I do?

Hopefully, you won't get flamed, either.  You will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is built on unsteady ground.  First, I do not believe that there is any way to find an \\\"objective morality\\\".  Morality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a person or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even overwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.   Second, I do not accept the assumptions that you make here.  If, as you say, you are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by using the Christian Bible?  You're defeating your own purpose by doing so.    Third, call me a pessimist, but you won't stop the flamage.  There will always be people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we all are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the religion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring, overbearing totalitarianists?    Hm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to discuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I start off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex with you.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of your own gender.  (Just a note: I really don't know your views on homosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the purposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to have their faces uncovered.  The sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but feels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind.

Your Whole Picture [TM] unfortunately only applies to people who accept your church.           In addition, if sex is for procreation, then  1) Why did God make it pleasurable, so that people would want to do it, rather than building it in as instinct? 2) Why did God make it fallible?  Not every sexual encounter results in pregnancy, even among Catholics.  Does this mean that they have sinned?     Granted.

EX:  I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM, an external video card (so I don't rob my SIMM's), and the default Apple cache card (I believe this is 32K?).  Say I have my cache set at 2 MEG, what good does a measly 32K do me on the cache card?  Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache between the card and the SIMM's?  Or does it still speed things up by providing a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly into the SIMM RAM cache?  I'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to really do any good compared to what you can set yourself.  Yet, Daystar FastCache has numbers which show around a 30% performance boost on some operations.  Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMM accesses?  Please help, I'm trying to find the optimum memory settings for the IIci system described in the EX above.\",\" Was that post for real? I thought it was a late April Fool joke. Some of it seemed a bit over the top even by McElwaine/Abian/etc standards :-) \",\"I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've  transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Note for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a single staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3 scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is  currently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale  experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.  On April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled  \\\"Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions\\\" here at the University of Illinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is not directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with  them recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used  the DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the details of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope they aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.  The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The main restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I did not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters and 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in  mid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson showed the following plot of acceleration vs time:                   ______ 3 G         /|   /      |            / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly            /  | /        |    good.  The big difference is that the lines 2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are         /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as        /                |          the graph wasn't up for very long. 1 G   /                 |                         |                         | 0 G                     |               ^          ^            ~100 sec    ~400 sec   As mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below 3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the accelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are  throtled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in  accelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines bring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut out entirely.  The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed for an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of air drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to  that desired.  Questions from the audience:  (paraphrased)  Q:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than     all at once?  A:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.  Q:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?  A:  Can't tell us.  \\\"Read Aviation Leak.\\\"  He also apparently had a good      propulsion example, but was told not to use it.    My question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting national security or MD protecting their own interests?  The second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch up maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and  the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs of heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar, and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate. The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have about 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about  60 degrees south latitude.  I would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about that aspect of the flight profile. \",\"Does anybody have any idea where I could find a program that can convert a .GIF image into a .BMP image suitable for a Windows  wallpaper (i.e. 256 colors).

Level 5?  Out of how many?  What are the different levels?  I've never    heard of this rating system.  Anyone care to clue me in?  This is a rating system used by ARPA and other organisations to measure the maturity of a `software process' i.e. the entire process by which software gets designed, written, tested, delivered, supported etc.  See `Managing the Software Process', by Watts S. Humphrey, Addison Wesley 1989. An excellent software engineering text. The 5 levels of software process maturity are:  1. Initial 2. Repeatable 3. Defined 4. Managed 5. Optimizing  The levels are approximately characterized as follows:  1. no statistically software process control. Have no statistical    basis for estimating how large software will be, how long it will    take to produce, how expensive it will be, or how reliable it will    be.  Most software production is at this level.  2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project    management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects    are planned in detail, and there is software configuration    management and quality assurance.  3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is    consistent.

Actually, I just finished writing a motif animation program... (take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When using on-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keep it from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, they were just about equal.    The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous sizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when debugging SHM apps).    Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g. Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be attached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes XShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24 bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using pixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to use the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one copies the info three times per redraw instead of one).    In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a Good Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick whatever feels fastest.

Please accept this as a serious attempt to foster dialog and rest assurred that I make every attempt to make fun of no one, except myself ;-)]    [...]    Hmmm.  There are other animals on this planet with advanced  mental facilities which have not developed \\\"religion\\\" as a  satisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?   Further, it appears that only humans have a \\\"need\\\" to explain the  unexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet,  including those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly  content in their ignorance.   I'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me  from your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal  *only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need  not be researched; 3) religion was \\\"made up\\\" by humans to address a  perceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that  is, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical  structure with biology at the apex).   Needless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the  underlying presuppositions.    I disagree that Christianity is \\\"an infectious cult\\\".  It has  certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in  spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.  That it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is  \\\"infectious\\\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides  a workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this  is the case).   I disagree that Christianity is \\\"a safety blanket\\\" which supplants  hope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one  Source of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a  Christian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to  you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose  and externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of  control over one's own life the problem or is it something else?   Finally, one does not appropriate \\\"eternal happiness\\\" by following  Christian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance  of Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people  from their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the  Christian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian  in the Person of God's Spirit.   Heaven is one of two final states that  Christian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally  not motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this  promised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived  benefits to them in the here-and-now.    Many Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a  priority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this  as a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate  priority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,  convert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).  Rather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting  the opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits  of a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful  that it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask  \\\"Why?\\\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-  plished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it  does not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian  is required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of  friendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot  evaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or  harm others if the sole purpose of being a \\\"friend\\\" is to gain a  conversion).   As a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-  ticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \\\"hurry-up\\\"  attitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no  conversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was  coerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open  to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).  The Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings  conviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part  (witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.    We are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die  just as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more  than this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is  so limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find  a more expansive view.   (For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing  arts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language  of other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?  How is it that humans can organize themselves in various social  structures whereas other animals have only one structure?)    Blatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.  Christianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not  a *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship  with a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-  knit relationship with this appelation.    There are \\\"Jesus freaks\\\" who let the emotional aspects of worship  and Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,  this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these  things flow.    Guilty by association?  That \\\"christianity\\\" which forces itself  upon another is not Christianity at all.    You appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened  2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?   I cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus' influence was a sole  result of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years  gone by this time.  It strains the bounds of credulity to assert  that nothing about Jesus' life was noteworthy _until_ the sack.    Christianity is having a relationship with Jesus Christ Himself.

As I've noted before, I'm not necessarily disputing the benefits of  eliminating anti-competitive legislation with regard to auto dealers, barbers, etc.  One need not, however, swallow the entire libertarian agenda to accomplish this end.  Just because one grants the benefits of allowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell his/her services without regulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be  free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention.   (As some/many libertarians would argue.)    On a case by case basis, the cost/benefit ratio of government regulation is obviously worthwhile.  The libertarian agenda, however, does not call for this assessment.  It assumes that the costs of regulation (of any kind) always outweigh its benefits.  This approach avoids all sorts of  difficult analysis, but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic,  to say the least.  I have no objection to an analysis of medical care, education,  national defense or local police that suggests a \\\"free market\\\" can provide a more effective, efficient means of accomplishing social objectives than is provided through \\\"statist\\\" approaches.   With some notable exceptions, however, I do not see such nitty-gritty, worthwhile  analysis being carried out by self-professed libertarians.    jsh\",\"Dunno about Miller.

What is important is HOW they are used, and what            else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. )             (1) THE 7-DAY FAST.                 1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind            at a time, preferably grapes.                 2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half            raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape            clean the intestinal linings.                 3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice            you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune            juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from            concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to            your home bathroom.)                 4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and            dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS            CONTAIN LAETRILE.).                 5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from            two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and            add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).             Drink one glass per hour.           [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day            every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH            PULP.]                 6th day: Same as 5th day.                 7th day: Same as 6th day.                 All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each            day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements,            plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.             (2) THE GRAPE DIET.                 Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to            8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the            six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.                   (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.                Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple            cider \\\"flavored\\\" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a            glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.             Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a            week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal            healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially            effective against those types of cancer that resemble a            FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections.                     (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]                Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level            comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.             Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely            dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt            (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda.                 Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising            your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your            stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down,            chomping your teeth together, etc..                 Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes            the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the            book \\\"Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2\\\", by Frances Nixon, 1973.                 PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should            prepare it and drain it.           For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away            from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly            expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt            other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at            least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.             (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take            a 2-Billion-bacteria \\\"Acidophilus\\\" capsule, which is also an            EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF \\\"A.I.D.S.\\\"            (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the            digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune            system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal            bacteria, it may also be a CURE for \\\"Lyme disease\\\".]           Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder            storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during \\\"Major\\\" or            \\\"Minor Periods\\\" as listed in the \\\"Solunar Tables\\\" published            bimonthly in \\\"Field & Stream\\\" Magazine, (because of the            measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields            present at those times).           Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year.                    (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES:                         For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the                 affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons                 per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for                 about 2 months.                          D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to                 perform NORMAL cell functions.                  ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.                  To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.                  To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per                 day.                [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.                  IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer                 cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile                 into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is                 ALSO present in the digestive system.)]                  ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include                 Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most                 people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A                 (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide                 Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up                 to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-                toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime                 will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types),                 suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes,                 prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not                 cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST                 \\\"A.I.D.S.\\\", which is really a form of cancer similar to                 leukemia.]  (See the book \\\"Life Extension\\\", by Durk                 Pearson and Sandy Shaw.)                  HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3%                 hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably                 DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day,                 hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.                  Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers                 several times per day.                Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good                 daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants                 described above.                  VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and                 much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA                 doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources.                  Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell)                 NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on                 and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an                 aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-                radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with                 daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH                 magnetic fields.                  Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES                 can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well                 as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics                 Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos                 of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays!                  INTERFERON tablets.                 TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho).                             HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical                 problems (even drug addiction!).                  50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure                 prostate trouble.                  This list is NOT exhaustive.              The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-           DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent            and cure many other medical problems including heart-           diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work            effectively.             Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these            remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send            a strong message to one's subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it            to CURE the cancer.             In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer,            then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies            described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast),            BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations            and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer            treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!].                                  DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources            that have shown themselves to be reliable.  The compiler of            this list is NOT a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his            First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the            subjects of his choice.

UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this            IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED.  \",\" Some thoughts:  Has any work been done on encapsulating encrypted data inside \\\"non-encrypted\\\" data files?  Many file formats can be written with \\\"gaps\\\" in them to hide other data.  New file formats could be designed to have alternate data hidden by dispersing it amongst the \\\"legitimate\\\" data.  The hidden data would only show up with the right key(s), and a file with hidden data would be indistinguishable from one without.  So, only the correct key(s) would reveal the presence of an \\\"illegal\\\" document.  If I devise a custom file compression algorithm and only I and a friend have the uncompressor, and otherwise the file appears to be total gigerish, do I have the right to transmit the file?  Will we have to \\\"escrow\\\" all our data file formats?  Are gangs required to escrow their hand signals, colors and catch phrases?\",\" It depends on the cause of the pneumonia.  For treating bacterial pneumonia in young otherwise-healthy non-smokers, erythromycin is usually considered the antibiotic of choice, since it covers the two most-common pathogens: strep pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae.\",\"Enclosed are the rules, guidelines and related information for the 10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest.

X X XGOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X    * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X    * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X XRULES: X X    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules: X X    1) Your entry must be a complete program. X X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters X       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or } X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536. X X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format: X X---entry--- Xrule: 1993 Xfix: y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry) Xtitle: title of entry        (see comments below) Xentry: Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0) Xdate: Date/time of submission in UTC     (see comments below) Xhost: Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested X Use tab indented lines if needed X---remark--- X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th X    column.  Blank lines are permitted. X---author--- Xname: your name Xorg: School/Company/Organization Xaddr: postal address X use tab indented lines to continue X don't forget to include the country Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain. X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines. Xanon: y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info) X---info--- XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section. X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2. X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X * The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X   and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X   It is suggested, but not required, that the title should X   incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors, X   consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X * The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X   to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()  X   using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X * You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X   it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the  X   ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same  X   title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be  X   sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X * With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above  X   format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X   something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate X   Email message to the judges. X X * Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless  X   'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X * To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X   each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X   should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X * The entry's remarks should include: X     - what this program does X     - how to run the program (sample args or input) X     - special compile or execution instructions, if any X     - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X     - information about any ---data--- files X     - why you think the program is obfuscated X     - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X     - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X * Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X   portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They  X   should not be required to exist. X X   If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X   section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple  X   ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X   each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: X X    'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed X    'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional X        digit, followed by '.c' X    your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X        title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not  X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to: X X  ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate X  obfuscate@toad.com X X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'.

X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers  X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with  X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor  X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X * look at the original source X * convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X * run it through a C beautifier X * examine the algorithm X * lint it X * compile it X * execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting \\\"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake\\\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X #define d define X #d foo     <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X int i; X j;     <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you  X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in  X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type. X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: X X int i; X char *c; X i[c];     <--- use c[i] instead X (i+3)[\\\"string\\\"];   <--- use \\\"string\\\"[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X * assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X * casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X * passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X * passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X * performing arithmetic on va_list variables X * using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X * are very hardware specific X * are very OS or Un*x version specific X      (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X       code is likely not to be) X * dump core or have compiler warnings X      (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X * won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X * abusing the build file to get around the size limit X * obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X * are longer than they need to be X * are similar to previous winners X * are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X * are as concise and small as they need to be X * do something at least quasi-interesting X * pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X * are portable X * are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X * MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X * make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X where this program differs from the contest rules, the X contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule: 1993 Xfix: n Xtitle: chonglab Xentry: 0 Xdate: Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost: Un*x v6, pdp11/45 X 2.9BSD, pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.

If an entry wins, we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition, X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award, X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X * Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X * Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X  cc prog.c -o special_name  need special binary X X     or  rm -f special_src.c   need special source X  cp prog.c special_src.c X  cc special_src.c -o special_name X X     or  rm -f special_build   need special build X  tail +4 build > special_build X  sh < special_build X X * Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of  X   your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You  X   should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the  X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges (not the address for X judges@toad.com      submitting entries) X     X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer  X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as  X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many  X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X date -u \\\"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\\\" X date -u | sed -e 's/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/' X sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X ---entry--- section X all ---author--- sections X all ---info--- sections X ---build--- section X ---program--- section X any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X * reading the ---entry--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X * passing the source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X * performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X * passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X * linting the source X * compiling/building the source X * running the program X * performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X * best small one line program X * best small program X * strangest/most creative source layout X * most useful obfuscated program X * best game that is obfuscated X * most creatively obfuscated program X * most deceptive C code X * best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X * best abuse of ANSI C X * worst abuse of the rules X * <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry  X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,  X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X     comp.lang.c    comp.unix.wizards alt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X     comp.sources.d   alt.sources.d  misc.misc X     comp.sources.misc   comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners  X    have appeared in books (\\\"The New Hackers Dictionary\\\") and on T-Shirts. X X    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-) X X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address: X X ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges (not the address for X judges@toad.com      submitting entries) X X    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.

Realistically, the Clipper-Chip will probably emit an ID code which will serve as the identifier when requesting the key fragments.  The chip manufacturer would register this identifier code vs. key combination when the chip is made and the (uninitiated) end-user can therefore remain completely outside the loop. The chip could be used in a cellular phone, a modem, or other device -- it really makes no difference:  When the authorities detect the use of this encryption standard during surveillance, they would then capture the ID and apply for the key in order to decrypt the data.\",\"You can't make a Citizens arrest on anything but a felony. .    \",\": It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions : prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  A good example of this is Abraham (referred to in the James passage). Hebrews says that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated through his works (i.e., he obeyed what God told him to do).  Reading Abraham's ``biography'' in Genesis is very instructive. He was a man beset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his wife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil God's promise on God's behalf by copulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didn't evaluate him on the basis of individual incidents. Abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of  faith'' in Hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, God declared Abraham as a man of faith. He believed God's promises.  This gives us confidence. Although real faith demonstrates itself through works, God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in performing works.  ``Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit.''

Funnily, the previous hidden wholesale tax that it replaces was never referred to as a tax (or, people never paid mind to it, thus the uproar when it was brought up front as the GST ---  one party has actually campaigned on hiding the tax again).  The stated intent of the Tories was to use the GST to write down our deficit.

Around the base of the hourglass is a ring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser in the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled through the tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  The sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for draft generation.  It should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on both fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at  locations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part time, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit. It was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish. Fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent, usually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typically takes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed  to cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.\",\"Hmmm....I was listening to the local radio expert (who is, amazingly enough, an Honest-to-God Expert(tm); it's amazing what he knows...),  and he said that, based on his conversations with the inventor of  Slick50 (who is no longer with the comapny, due to some kind of  conflict), he avoids it like the plague.

For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side to the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.  Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a couple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an efficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour).  Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the temperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably its power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no leakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more (although that would be a lousy way to control it).

The first part of the plan is to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to robust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.  However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the National Security Agency.  The so-called \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is an 80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be classified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into its communications products.       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .  First, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for the Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.  Second, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.    Third, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth Amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few of the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to answer.  In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security.  However, the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" solution ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the discussion even begins.  DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:  ESCROW  The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom hold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow agents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.  Upon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to the Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration have suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the Federal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen, but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.  CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS  The Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which the government or others could break the code without securing keys from the escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be made public.  The Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source, secret contract between the National Security Agency and two private firms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for about four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.  GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER  In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al Gore, and maybe even the President.  At today's Commerce Department press briefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?  COMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY  The Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption, and law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export controls on encryption technology and the FBI's Digital Telephony Proposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the National Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential Directive describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement in the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.  FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:  Jerry Berman, Executive Director (jberman@eff.org) Daniel J.

I sat in a Dodge Caravan, which had a high seat and plenty of headroom. \",\"If you are interested in receiving the final player stats for the 1992-1993 NHL Season as well as playoff box scores, stats and scores/updates... then e-mail my stat server  mmilitzo@skidmore.edu\",\"  If there are many as..., er, people in the USA who reason like the above, then it should not be surprising that the current plot has been allowed to happen...  Regards, Vesselin\",\" As I have read this net the last few days, I am continually amazed at the  pronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals.  Especially when it  comes down to saying that the Bosox haven't a prayer.  As a long time Red Sox fan, I will simply say:  The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of you with short memories. short lives, or both.    To be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism from those who only follow 'the hot team'.  This statement is supported based on the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net.  A true fan of a  team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean years, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.    Yeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares if Clemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  The fact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans supported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of  detracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what  happens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly  not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all, remember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that far, let alone beat Baltimore.  Let's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football and Basketball.  Because of this, one can never say with absolute certainity what the outcome will be over the course of 162 games.\",\"  Some tape archivists suggest what they were after had something to do with the Kennedy assasination. Let's hear all of the tapes real soon, shall we?  \",\" Cite one of these conflicting statutes.  You keep making these assertions, but you haven't supported any of them yet. I am speaking of statutes that conflict with the definition Larry posted.  Why did you delete the code that Larry posted?  Also, the Model Penal Code made perfect sense to me.  Were you, perhaps, confused by it?  Also, I am still looking for your definition.  The one you used clearly indicates that a fetus is not a human being.   Circular arguments are usually very consistent.    Again, your desire for consistency disappears when it does not suit your needs.  The principle of protecting life is abandoned based on \\\"action versus inaction.\\\"  Not much of a principle.  Suddenly you recognize that the claim on bodily resources is dependent on circumstances other than this principle of life.  That's a very conevnient principle you have there, Matt.\",\"I've just read Richard Langley's latest \\\"Navstar GPS Constellation Status\\\".

Dudley and Nielson are the only two coaches bad enough in the league to take talents like Mogilny and Kovalev and not know how to turn them into Bure and Selanne.   Get Muckler as coach, and Kovalev will look like Mogilny.  The trouble with the Rangers is that Neil Smith went out and got players like Messier, Kovalev, and Graves who have been schooled in taking the game to their opponent and attacking, while hiring coaches who are interested in \\\"rope-a-dope\\\" strategies.  If you want the Roger Nielsons of the world to be your coach you don't go out and get a Mark Messier, who is an old dog who can't learn new tricks from a known loser, and you don't waste your draft picks on players like Kovalev.  Gerald\",\"  Gretzky, Lemieux, Gilmour etc do not play the role of checking centreman. They play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one.  If they were used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive abilities.   When you compare Gretzky et al to Jarvis, Gainey etc you are comparing  apples and oranges.  It is like me telling you that Felix Potvin isn't  very good because a team would be better if the had Lemieux instead of him.  Sure Lemieux is a better player, but he is a different type of player.  For a team to be successful, they need to have all types of players- this includes defensive forwards.  When compared with other defensive forwards, Bob Gainey is the greatest defensive forward ever.  He is the player who's talents best suited being a defensive forward- who completely dominated the game when he played.  Maybe if a more talented player such as Gretzky had decided to waste his offensive talents and play defensively, he could have been a better defensive forward, but he wasn't.  Bob Gainey is the best defensive forward that has ever played hockey.\",\"}>}(a) out of context; }>Must have missed when you said this about these other \\\"promises of god\\\" that we keep }>getting subjected to.

It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you very much).   well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell me the order of the wires.   there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.   if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.   btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of little boxes). Oh, well . . .   one more thing: in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on the newer models are different from the connection used on the plus--- you're right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plus and connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. in other words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible. it's merely a matter of finding out the correct order.   omt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solution so others can, too. thanx for the input.\",\"  This is true as evinced by the popularity of shaft-drive drag bikes.\",\" You can go to the DMV and ask for their listing.

People have said that religion is bad by any account, and that it is in no way useful, etc., but I don't totally agree with this.  Of course, we cannot really say how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion, but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it.  So basically, we can not judge whether religion is the right route for a given individual, or even for a general population.  We can say that it is not best for us personally (at least, you can choose not to use religion--might be hard to try to find out its benefits, as you state above).\",\" Called \\\"gas\\\".

Although two months  have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I  have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at   almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from  Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly  slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to  save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful  events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then  taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people   well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these  places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.  They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the  Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality  problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers  who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and  Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the   Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs.   I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is   destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are   speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as   well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is   proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.\\\"                                                       Dr. Stephan Eshnanie  Serdar Argic\",\"Hi from Australia,  I am a car enthusiast in Australia.

I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed seperately on my pay stub.  While I'm not the only Canadian who favours lower taxes and cutbacks in spending, health insurance isn't on the table.  See our polls ... A better one might be the July 1st polls conducted for Macleans (our major English newsmagazine) by Decima Research ... Decima president Allen Gregg is considered one of the world's top poll researchers, and Mulroney's Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in the face of impossible election situations.  I haven't had a chance to see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had shown satisfaction at 97% and switching to an American all-private system had support within statistical noise.  The Decima polls are considered definitive.  Even the new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \\\"libertarian\\\" faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these).  Personally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used in Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in a nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a lot on values in those societies different from the U.S.  The basic health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.  Plenty of room is left for expenditure of private funds as extra insurance or as   Please explain this one, hopefully in a way that Canadian readers besides myself can understand and concur ...  gld\",\"If a PC has one, does Windows 3.1 use a math co-processor?

It is an S3 86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my second meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the ordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from them, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say \\\"Buy the memory from us\\\" or something like that.)   The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a 1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256. Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I asked them why, and all I got was \\\"Your point is well taken, but Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects.\\\"   So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805 drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're broken.   If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805 cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are \\\"less busy\\\".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805 product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?), although evenn that might be a misprint.   Please, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out there, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.\",\"In <1r1om5$c5m@slab.mtholyoke.edu> jbotz@mtholyoke.edu (Jurgen Botz)     Then it is a good thing we already have this:  The csspub mailing list: csspab@mail-gw.ncsl.nist.gov, and address on the clipper mailing list, seems to contain basically the members of the NIST security board.

The gap was quite small on the left side, but much larger on the right.  Blech!!!\",\"I am having trouble with SCSI on a Mac IIfx. The machine is 3 years old and I have been using the same hard drive (internal Maxtor LXT-200S) for two and a half years. The disk recently crashed. I reformatted (Silverlining 5.42), but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing. The error message reported was like:  Sector 0: Write error detected after testing good - sector not mapped out.  This occurred randomly all over the hard disk (which makes me suspect the diagnostic's reference to Sector 0 ??? ). On the third reformat and after reinstalling the SCSI read/write loops I was able to get through passes 2,3, and 4 with no errors. (Pass 1 for some reason reported a lot of errors, but still mapped out no sectors.) I decided to go ahead and try to resinstall System 7 and reload my data from a backup. This proceded normally; however, I now have sub-optimal performance. Symptoms include:     o Frequent crashes    o Instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to        correct.    o Instances of not finding the disk on the SCSI chain on reboot.        - If I boot from Norton Utl. after this occurs, it cannot find the          disk either.        - The only thing that fixes this is recycling the power. It sometimes          requires several attempts.  QUESTIONS:     1) Has anyone had this type of problem before?    2) Is the problem with the fx motherboard (And its non-standard       SCSI implementation) or with my Maxtor Disk? Is there some       diagnostic software that would help me make this determination?    3) Is it a termination problem? I currently have external Syquest       and an external DataFrame XP60 on the chain. The XP60 is at the       end, and has internal termination; so I am not using the IIfx       terminator. I do have the SCSI filter installed on the internal       drive. I have run with this exact steup for 2 1/2 years with       one previous disk crash requiring a reformat (about a year ago).       I also have symptoms if I disconnect the external devices;       so I don't see how SCSI termination would now be an issue.

We have too many people with their heads in the sand saying it cannot happen here, as our Constitutional Rights are being trashed every day because the government justifies doing some end-run around the protections by a 'crisis' requiring 'drastic action'.   It is most likely that in the future possession of secure encryption tools will be regarded as possession of 'terrorist and drug dealers tools', and be some serious Fedaral Felony. Just like common tools are 'burgular tools' if the police say so, common computer programs (even computers themselves) are now 'hackers tools', and will become 'terrorist tools'.  BET ON IT.  The insights of someone who has lived throught this are very important. If the US goes the way of the old Soviet Union and its client states as far as individual rights, privacy and overall freedom are concerned, the rest of the world (remember 'New World Order'?) will not be far behind - only a few years.  Please keep posting anything you find that is deficient or that threatens ones rights in this thing.  For example, a conversation between a suspect and a lawyer will no longer be private from Big Brother eavesdropping.  Political dissent allready is very dangerous in this country, all it takes is the government to decide that enough people will take one seriously, then one becomes guilty of 'plotting to overthrow the government by illegal means'.  The phrase 'illegal means' is defined as whatever the government wants it to be defined as.  Couple this with Clinton's pressing for a 'smart' National ID card (an 'Internal passport'?), with the added wrinkle that anything about you and your past can be put on it, and you can only take the government's word as to what is really on it (since they will be the only ones with the means to completely read and reprogram the thing).  Isn't that nice?  While the Feds can bust into one's safe without the keys, the owner knows his safe has been broken into.  When they break into your 'secure' phone conversations (or other stored/transmitted data in the near future) you have no way of knowing, so accountability as to the legalities has gone out the window.  Just like a safe, if they have a legal cause, they can get the keys from the suspect, just like they can get the keys to a safe or the combination from the suspect.  Same with encryption: Record everything, get the warrants, THEN decode it with the keys obtained from the suspect.  This Clinton Cripple, along with its natural extensions, will make any priviliged communications between client and lawyer, and any meaningful political dissent virtually impossible.  Which is the general idea. Any propeganda about its being secure, and the safeguards, and all of that are just that - propeganda to reassure people so they will by into this monstrosity.

Today (Tueday 4-6-93) IBM is supposed to officially announce the introduction of the VESA Local Bus Value Point systems.  These systems still have on-board video and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems, and you get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three of them with 17\\\" monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three will immediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller and either the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board.  Do not buy a 486SX sytem.  My personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  When you earn money you pay taxes, when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. they get you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but large steps.

Its easy enough to convert, but if I don't know which way they are stored, I dont know  which direction the polygon should be visible from.  If DXF doesn't handle this, can anyone recommend a workaround? The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one in the DXF file, one stored CW and the other CCW.

There are no other alternatives.  And if we accept one or the other of those two premises, then again there are two alternatives, either creation was random, or was according to some plan.    If it was random, I am unable to accept that the complex nature of our world with interrelated interdependent organisms and creatures could exist as they do.  Therefore I am left with creation under the control of an intelligence capable of devising such a scheme.  I call that intelligence God.    I also prefer the \\\"Creatio ex nihilo\\\" rather than from chaos, as it is cleaner.    There is obviously no way to prove either or neither.  We are and we must have come from somewhere.

Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced to give it up (Ramsey's now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from Mike Foligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy Ruff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, who retired, so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it? After all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit. Jim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, in reverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I'm not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroit and Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smith seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I don't know if the captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games he played for Buffalo.  This is actually getting fascinating.  :-)  Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded, almost, unless you're a franchise player. \",\"long disk   I don't know how many times I've posted this the net.

I am a divorced father. Chance would have it that \\\"my weekend\\\" with my  daughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.  Although I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decided that the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith was too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a date), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.  During the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church.   When our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she  be baptised as Catholic. This wasn't a problem with me.  During a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease that affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward for two months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated \\\"effectively\\\".  In other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.  During the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over my daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday visitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study books to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.  Last fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings. At that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time, I started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend. I did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a religious community.  Today, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for  Communion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine (The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the pew in front of us.  I feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her religious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments if you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.  My daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and mature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly for religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with my daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.  My initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith in Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays with her again.  I do not want to \\\"drive her from the fold\\\", and would be willing to allow her to continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only for two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.  Any suggestions?  If you have a response, please e-mail me a copy. (I'm not a regular reader of this newsgroup.) (Naturally, feel free to post too!)  Thanks, and I hope you've had a happy Easter.  Drew \",\"Thanks to all who responded.   The three items (electric vest, Aerostitch Suit, and Scarf) are all spoken for.  -Gary \",\"Greetings and Salutations!  I would like to get in touch with people who (a) consider themselves Christians (you define it), and (b) are in the Martial Arts  Some topics for discussion:  - your particular martial art  - your view of the relationship between   Christianity and your art  - your view of the relationship between   *your* Christianity and your art  - why should a Christian participate in MA  - why shouldn't a Christian participate in MA  - Biblical views of MA; pro or con.  For example, I heard from one fellow:  \\\"...I tried the Karate for Christ thing and it wasn't for me...\\\"  - why or why not?  As an aside, I am involved (in *NO* official way) with an organization called the Christian Black Belt Association and I would also like to distribute info regarding upcoming events to *those who are interested*.

For more information, type `man [cmd]' or `apropos [keyword]' at the   UNIX shell prompt.      passwd - change password     finger - obtain information about a remote user     chfn   - change information about yourself obtainable by remote              users (sometimes `passwd -f')     chmod  - change the rights associated with a file or directory     umask  - (shell) change the default (on creation) file access              rights     ls     - list the rights associated with files and directories     xhost  - allow or disable access control of particular users to an              Xwindow server     last   - list the latest user logins on the system and their              originations     who    - list other users, login/idle times, originations     w      - list other users and what they are running     xhost  - access control list for X Window client use     xauth  - control X Window server authentication          .signature  - file in the home directory appended to USENET posts     .forward    - file used to forward email to other accounts     .Xauthority - file used for X Window server authentication keys     $SIGNATURE  - variable used for name in email and USENET postings    The 'tcpdump' packet-tracing program is loosely based on SMI's   \\\"etherfind\\\" although none of the etherfind code remains.  It was   originally written by Van Jacobson, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,   as part of an ongoing research project to investigate and improve   tcp and internet gateway performance.  A current version is   available via anonymous ftp from host ftp.ee.lbl.gov (currently at   address 128.3.254.68) file tcpdump.tar.Z (a compressed Unix tar   file). This program is subject to  the 'standard' Berkeley network   software copyright.  _____ <4.2> How can I learn about or use cryptography?    A general introduction to mostly theoretical cryptographic issues,   especially those frequently discussed in sci.crypt, is available   in FAQ form:    >  Compiled by:   >        cme@ellisun.sw.stratus.com (Carl Ellison)   >        Gwyn@BRL.MIL (Doug Gwyn)   >        smb@ulysses.att.com (Steven Bellovin)    NIST (U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology)   publishes an introductory paper on cryptography, special   publication 800-2 ``Public-Key Cryptograhy'' by James Nechvatal   (April 1991).  Available via anonymous FTP from   csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (129.6.54.11), file pub/nistpubs/800-2.txt.    Also via available anonymous FTP from wimsey.bc.ca as crypt.txt.Z   in the crypto directory.  Covers technical mathematical aspects   of encryption such as number theory.    More general information can be found in a FAQ by Paul Fahn of RSA   Labortories via anonymous FTP from rsa.com in /pub/faq.ps.Z.  See   the `readme' file for information on the `tex' version.  Also   available as hardcopy for $20 from   RSA Laboratories, 100 Marine   Parkway, Redwood City, CA  94065.  Send questions to   faq-editor@rsa.com.    Phil Zimmerman's PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) public-domain package   for public key encryption is available at numerous sites, and is   in widespread use over the internet for general UNIX-based file   encryption (including email).  Consult the archie FTP database.    Also see the newsgroup alt.security.pgp.  Mailing list requests   to info-pgp-request@lucpul.it.luc.edu.    From the RIPEM FAQ by Marc VanHeyningen   <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu> on news.answers:    > RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)   > using the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows   > your electronic mail to have the properties of authentication   > (i.e. who sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can   > read it except the intended recipient.)   >    > RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan   > <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>. Most of the code is in the public domain,   > except for the RSA routines, which are a library called RSAREF   > licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.   >    > RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent   > residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the   > README file for info.   >    > RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its `home site' on   > rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in   > the U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To   > find out how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and   > read the file GETTING_ACCESS.    Note: cryptography is generally not well integrated into email yet   and some system proficiency is required by users to utilize it.  _____ <4.3> What is the cypherpunks mailing list?    Eric Hughes <hughes@toad.com> runs the `cypherpunk' mailing list   dedicated to ``discussion about technological defenses for privacy   in the digital domain.''  Send email to   cypherpunks-request@toad.com to be added or subtracted from the   list. From the charter:    > The most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption.   > To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.  But to encrypt   > with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for   > privacy. Cypherpunks hope that all people desiring privacy will   > learn how best to defend it.  _____ <4.4> What are some privacy-related newsgroups?  FAQs?

The first line of the text of the message must be `SEND   > RFCnnnn.TXT-1', where nnnn is replaced by the RFC number.    _____ <4.7> How can I run an anonymous remailer?    Cypherpunk remailer source is at soda.berkeley.edu in the   /pub/cypherpunks directory.  It's written in PERL, and is   relatively easy to install (no administrative rights are required).   Karl Barrus  <elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu> has more information and   modifications. Also, most remailer operators mentioned above are   amenable to discussing features, problems, and helping new sites   become operational. Address all points in the section   ``responsibities of anonymous use'' in this document prior to   advertising your service.  You should be committed to the long-term   stability of the site and avoid running one surreptitiously.  _____ <4.8> What are references on privacy in email?

It provides an anonymous medium through which MIT   > students can say those things they might otherwise find   > difficult, inconvenient or impossible to say in person.  It's   > also a way to send fun or totally random messages to your   > friends over the air.

For more   information send email to crosslink@athena.mit.edu.   MISCELLANEOUS =============  _____ <5.1> What is ``digital cash''?    With digital encryption and authentication technologies, the   possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be   realized.  A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks   (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may   be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and   anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an   economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum   (~Dec.1992).    An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus   <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the   cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to   elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:      ::     command: help          user@host    where `user@host' is your email address.      _____ <5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?    These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,   especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past   a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as   breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most   internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a   ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,   curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a   system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and   patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also   the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.     _____ <5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?    From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:    > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were   > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy   > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,   > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant   > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people   > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,   > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek   > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or   > their opinions.    See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.    See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary   in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.  _____ <5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?    Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the   techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication   but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself.    Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the   proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible   to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,   typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is   posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually   untraceable  communication can take place between sender and   receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic   realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where   individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual   users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An   anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman   (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to   <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following   commands in the subject line:      subscribe     unsubscribe     help  _____ <5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?    `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain   protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information   or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make   public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade   `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be   concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in   operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that   some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious   because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This   argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet   posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a   very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at   worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ   for alt.security.        Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic   Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First   International Symposium on National Security & National   Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:    > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep   > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's   > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If   > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there   > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I   > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into   > an environment where any information which is at all interesting   > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little   > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,   > but you may differ...  _____ <5.6> What are `identity daemons'?      RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to   query a remote user's login name after connection to a local   communication socket (a connection of this type is established   during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not   widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement   it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to   anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system   adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a   trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.  _____ <5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?     Remailing/Posting   -----------------      - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,     publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.   - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET     postings.   - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information     obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,     encrypted addresses, etc.)   - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and     remailer site chaining.      General   -------      - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy     shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the     general public and their governments.   - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies      by systems designers into     hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'     `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.   - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than     wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement     agencies.   - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government     agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to     strengthening and protecting it.   ISSUES ======  _____ <6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?    From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:    > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic   > media which connect us.  Computer-based communication media like   > electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis   > of new forms of community.  These communities without a single,   > fixed geographical location comprise the first settlements on an   > electronic frontier.   >    > While well-established legal principles and cultural norms give   > structure and coherence to uses of conventional media like   > newspapers, books, and telephones, the new digital media do not   > so easily fit into existing frameworks.  Conflicts come about as   > the law struggles to define its application in a context where   > fundamental notions of speech, property, and place take   > profoundly new forms. People sense both the promise and the   > threat inherent in new computer and communications technologies,   > even as they struggle to master or simply cope with them in the   > workplace and the home.   >    > The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been established to help   > civilize the electronic frontier; to make it truly useful and   > beneficial not just to a technical elite, but to everyone; and to   > do this in a way which is in keeping with our society's highest   > traditions of the free and open flow of information and   > communication.      EFF was started by the multimillionaire Mitchell Kapor, founder of   Lotus software, and John Barlow, lyricist for the Grateful Dead   rock band.  A highly publicized endeavor of the organization   involved the legal defense of  Steve Jackson Games after an FBI   raid and an accompanying civil suit  (see section on ``Steve   Jackson Games'').  The foundation publishes EFF News (EFFector   Online) electronically, send requests to effnews-request@eff.org.      In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee   with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated   November 5, 1991,  Representative  Edward J. Markey complemented   Mitchell Kapor on his ``insights on the development of a national   public information infrastructure'' which ``were appreciated greatly   by myself and the Members of the Subcommittee'' (complete text in    ftp.eff.com:/pub/pub-infra/1991-12):    > ...we need to pursue policies that encourage the Bell companies to   > work with other sectors of the communications industry to create   > a consumer-oriented, public information network. Please let me or   > my staff know what policies you and others in the computer   > industry believe would best serve the public interest in creating   > a reasonably priced, widely available network in which   > competition is open and innovation rewarded.  I also want to   > learn what lessons from the computer industry over the past ten   > to fifteen years should apply to the current debate on   > structuring the information and communications networks of the   > future....I ask your help in gaining input from the computer   > industry so that the Subcommittee can shape policies that will   > bring this spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship to the   > information services industry.      ftp.eff.org   ===========      /pub/eff/about-eff   ---     A file of basic information about EFF including goals, mission,     achievements, and current projects.

The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility have been   working to protect and promote electronic civil liberties issues   since ~1982.  The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,   Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation   against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other   U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation   on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,   NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in   Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on   Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to   testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and   caller identification.    CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available   via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising   the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For   more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.     (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions   here.)  _____ <6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?    In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies   on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in   such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.      (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):    > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May   > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card   > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success.    > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying   > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of   > their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some   > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department   > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide   > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of   > jurisdictions.    Massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated   instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a   crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal   search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of   Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST   by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science   Fiction Magazine:    > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional   > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the   > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared   > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,   > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin   > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only   > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place.    > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that   > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document   > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.    FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed   on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier   Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an article by Joe   Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1, 1993:      > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret   > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal   > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a   > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,   > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment.    >    > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in   > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1,   > 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke   > over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer   > seizure policies.  While the Service has seized dozens of   > computers since the crackdown began in 1990, this is the first   > case to challenge the practice.    >    > Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin   > science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never   > suspected of a crime, and that agents did not do even marginal   > research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and   > the suspected illegal activities of an employee, or to determine   > that the company was a publisher. Indeed, agents testified that   > they were not even trained in the Privacy Protection Act at the   > special Secret Service school on computer crime.    >    > \\\"How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what   > Steve Jackson Games did, what it was?\\\" asked Sparks. \\\"An hour?    >    > \\\"Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to   > Steve Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything   > taken?    >    > \\\"Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had   > a picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen   > -- saying he was a computer crime suspect?    >    > \\\"Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material   > could harm Steve Jackson economically?\\\"    >    > Foley replied, \\\"No, sir,\\\" but the judge offered his own answer.    >    > \\\"You actually did, you just had no idea anybody would actually go   > out and hire a lawyer and sue you.\\\"    >    > More than $200,000 has been spent by the Electronic Frontier    > Foundation in bringing the case to trial. The EFF was founded by    > Mitchell Kapor amid a civil liberties movement sparked in large   > part by the Secret Service computer crime crackdown.      ftp.eff.org   ===========      /pub/cud/papers/sundevil   ---     A collection of information on Operation SunDevil by the Epic     nonprofit publishing project.

ISDN is a high-speed data communications standard that utilizes   existing copper telephone lines, and is a possible inexpensive and   intermediate alternative to laying fiber optic cable for phone   networks.  The speeds involved may be sufficient for audio and   video transmission applications.  G.

The article ``Internet'' in Fantasy and Science Fiction by Bruce   Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> contains general and nontechnical   introductory notes on origins of the Internet, including the role   of the RAND corporation, the goal of network resilience in face of   nuclear attack, MIT, UCLA, ARPANET, TCP/IP, NSF, NREN, etc.:    > ARPANET itself formally expired in 1989, a happy victim of its    > own overwhelming success.  Its users scarcely noticed, for   > ARPANET's  functions not only continued but steadily improved.    > The use of  TCP/IP standards for computer networking is now   > global.  In 1971, a  mere twenty-one years ago, there were only   > four nodes in the  ARPANET  network.  Today there are tens of   > thousands of  nodes in  the Internet,  scattered over forty-two   > countries, with more coming  on-line every day.   Three million,   > possibly four million people use  this gigantic   > mother-of-all-computer-networks.      >    > The Internet is especially popular among scientists, and is    > probably the most important scientific instrument of the late    > twentieth century.

Last year the Internet was growing at   > a rate of  twenty percent a *month.*  The number of `host'   > machines with direct  connection to TCP/IP has been doubling   > every year since  1988.   The Internet is moving out of  its   > original base in military and  research institutions,  into   > elementary and high schools, as well as into  public libraries   > and the commercial sector.

I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has just been released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewed several monitors, including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the Nanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last year.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing criteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and I scored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it scored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.  Incidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading reviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the criteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product testing was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly know what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the ranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet your needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some of what we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may apply more closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell anything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you don't also understand the scoring.\",\"Some kind soul told me that I could change the serial port buffer size of Zterm via ResEdit.

That way, I could play around a bit and maybe get my Duo to do something useful with its serial port. (other than Appletalk).  BTW, I believe that when the port stats says that maximum in buffer is 3074 bytes, that that means increasing the buffer will help, if you are using hardware handshaking.

The  Alexandria bookstore (that's the name of the book store operated  by AMORC) should have a selection that should provide the interested reader more insight).   Cheers, Kent\",\"A few points about Mary's being taken into heaven at the end of her life on earth:  One piece of evidence for Mary's assumption into heaven is the fact that no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was buried. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final resting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever claimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why? Because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.  Although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of Mary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation that describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned in the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other interpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.  The assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to Christ.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the requirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we are to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he took his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to allow her flesh to rot in the grave.  One last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary did not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe. The dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying whether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic theologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make sense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the cross, would want to share in his death.\",\"  Your comment here is meant as a put down. It fails for several reasons :  1) You have edited out the context of the action under discussion.  2) I never brought the legal definition up. I use the English language and not the legal dialect. The legal definition of fraud changes from one country to another in any case. The context of the discussion is morality of censorship.     You are extrapolating from the statement I made concerning a circumstance in which such an act of censorship would be permissable to the Teel case. If you had bothered to read the post instead of trying to prove how stupid you thought me you would have done rather better. The mode of argument I was using was a form of rhetoric. Argument by example, I describe a wide set of circumstances in which an action is permisable and demonstrate that they do not apply, thus the action is not permisable.  Obviously a company posting from a University adress would be squashed,  it would be contrary to the internet comercial use.   Now you are clutching at straws. In the context of the discussion it was the fact of association between the company and the post that was important. The typeface etc is inconsequential.    If you are implying that I am lying I suggest you read Mark Holohan and Ulick Staffords posts into soc.culture.british. If you are suggesting that  advocating murder is a trivial matter I would prefer that you state it directly.   Certainly I oppose the right of Dr Sidiqui and the Ayatolah Khomenhi to call for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Incitement to murder is not part of what I consider legitimate freedom of speech.    That is irrelevant, the case is not the incremental cost but the facility cost. If I decide that a company I am associated with should subscribe to USEnet that usenet connection is the property of the company. It is quite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and regulate the use of its property in accordance with its policy. For example if a Microsoft employee were to post \\\"Windows NT is crap don't buy it\\\" from a Microsoft machine I would consider it reasonable for Microsoft to sack that employee. In the same way if a company decides that it has  political objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political manner. This is no worse than Rupert Murdoch using his papers as a political platform for his views.    ah yes you did not quote them, merely refered to them.    Your article consisted of a reference to the first ammendment, your signature and pretty well damn all else.     Are you refering to the initial hearings on an injunction or the judgments on the substantive case?  The initial hearings that the government won were judged on the not unresonable judgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be harmed would be grounds for prior restraint. The second set of hearings on the substance judged that the government had no case and that the official secrets act could not be used to suppress information in thwe public domain already. The part that they won was over the copyright issue which is rather separate.  Here again the issue of censorship is rather different in the case that information is divulged on the understanding that it will not be communicated to third parties. The first ammendment certainly does not apply in this case as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the US proves.   The crux of the Spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of British law. The censorship aspect of it arose as a result of the government's ludicrous attempts to prevent summary of the case in the book.     Funny I saw that as a rejection of an assertion that you had made. Of course in rejecting an assertion I have to make a contrary assertion, since this assertion is unprovable I left it at that.   So far I have not seen you demonstrate a command of the contrary opinion to your own. You are attacking my anti-censorship view because I dare to accept the validity of some pro-censorship arguments while rejecting their conclusions.  Plus I am not an absolutist. I have this funny idea that the solution to this problem was not decided in 1789 by a group of white male gentry in secret session and sumarized in a single line. Furthermore I don't think that the issues are half as simple as you imply.

That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian & American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean Burke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn  McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been  3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the  Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford  or Tampa Bay currently are doing. --- But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia?  Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:  (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=NHL regular+) (13-17=NHL regular) ( 8-12=role player)  FINLAND:    D-Jyrki Lumme.......20 D-Teppo Numminen....20 D-Peter Ahola.......13  C-Jari Kurri........25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16  R-Teemu Selanne.....27  L-Esa Tikkanen......20 (Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)  SWEDEN: D-Ulf Samuelsson....21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom...18 D-Calle Johansson...18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin......13 D-Tommy Albelin......7  C-Mats Sundin.......26 C-Thomas Steen......18  R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen........18 R-Michael Nylander..13  L-Per-Erik Eklund...18 L-Johan Garpenlov...16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon........14  This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's Selanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL. --- Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America. Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in  Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points. Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \\\"dynasty\\\" talk isn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time, won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top  Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a  couple of years the same way Edmonton's \\\"dynasty\\\" crumbled in the late '80s.  Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an  exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a  compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during  the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this,  the amateur draft should be open to anyone.  \",\" this borders on blasphemy.\",\"     I beleive it's called the \\\"Dentabox\\\" frame.

Good thing you slowed down!\",\" This a \\\"tried and true\\\" method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups: to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace, thus forcing the opposing \\\"state\\\" to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or, in order to avoid the deaths of civilians, abandon the search. Certainly the people who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm's way.  Are you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, Israel should totally back down? So...the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives?   Your damn right Israel insists on some sort of \\\"demilitarized\\\" or \\\"buffer\\\" zone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory of Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactly surprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to  do it themselves.   What? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states  can start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the  responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their  soil. They have to Prove it (or provide some \\\"guaratees\\\"), there is no way Israel is going to accept their \\\"word\\\"- not with their past attitude of  tolerance towards \\\"anti-Israel guerillas in-residence\\\".  Good lord, Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop anything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows them in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in '56 and '67. Somehow, with that \\\"limitation\\\" on the troops \\\"powers\\\" I don't think that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) \\\"guarantees\\\" by other parties, the UN is worthless to Israel (but, perhaps useful as a \\\"ruse\\\"?).   Perhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is the feeling that it is better that \\\"many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently  accept our fate.\\\" If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of  suffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian, Arab and Islamic groups.   From Israel's perspective, \\\"concessions\\\" gets it NOTHING...except the  realization that it has given \\\"something\\\" up and now *can only  hope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken back* by merely doing so; to \\\"take back\\\" tangible items (land, control of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should stay away from.   Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades  before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon. The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel  would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state  involved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure  in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts  committed by \\\"private groups\\\", 3) Israel would prepare for the next  round of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and don't be so idiotic as to suggest \\\"trust\\\" for the motivations of present-day Arab states)?  Ah, ok...what is \\\"different\\\" about the present situation that tells us that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic  policies towards Israel? Now, don't talk about vague \\\"political factors\\\" but about those \\\"tangible\\\" (just like that which Israel gave up) factors that \\\"guarantee\\\" the responsibility of those states. Your assessment of \\\"difference\\\" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions, and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing.   It has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria, Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred. Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain  control? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel.

I hate to be derogatory, but in this case I think it's warranted.  HSP's are part of the cellular response to stress.  The only reason they are called 'heat shock proteins' is because they were first demonstrated using heat shock.  Dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce ANY protein- because it's DEAD!    Also, who cares if the DNA you are ingesting is mutated!?  It will be  completely digested in your stomach, which is about pH 2.    Some of you worry WAY too much.  Eat a healthy, balanced diet and relax.  My advice is, if you don't know what you are talking about, it is better to keep your mouth shut than to open it and remove all doubt about your ignorance.

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger    economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a    lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,    but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing    military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than    just a \\\"we have the money, why not?\\\" approach.  Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not wasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills to fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding high-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the defense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to fund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European cooperation.  Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of money (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as investment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at the size of that multiplier :->).\",\" :   I have normal procomm plus for dos, but I've been considering buying : the windows version....it got really great reviews in computer shopper. : I have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here : using it, but the screen seems to have a problem keeping up with the : modem....he has a 14,400 modem on a 486 50 Mhz machine.

Edition 01 Apr 93  This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2 or DOS apps not running under Windows.  One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that their RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST) discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or FAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer than with the old 2400bps modem.   There are three reasons for the problem:  1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most    PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the    operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high    interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and    the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded    environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.  2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and    interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely    than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you    are losing data, you may be advised that \\\"you need to upgrade to a    16550\\\". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance    about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the    store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve    my own problem had never heard the term \\\"16550\\\" and many didn't even    know what a UART was.  3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade    your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience    errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers    don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this    regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications    like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem    by themselves.  If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem card.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they are to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one. Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.   The Hardware Situation.  The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250 or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace them).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft diagnostic program \\\\WINDOWS\\\\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before* bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.  The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to 460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access cycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info, see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.  So, what UART component do you have?  Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM board or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with the numbers \\\"8250\\\" or \\\"16450\\\", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI, and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE your VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket COM board.  If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The \\\"N\\\" chip is the normal 40-pin dual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550 chips without the \\\"A\\\" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).  Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various IC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips: National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552 Chips&Technology:       82C607 Texas Instruments:      t16c550a Silicon Systems:        73M550 VLSI                    16C550 TurboCom warns about the pre-\\\"A\\\" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550, says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70 systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).  If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after- market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you may be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to either disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to COM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).  Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology MCT-AIO+ card from:  JDR Microdevices 2233 Samaritan Drive San Jose  CA  95124 (800) 538-5000 voice US (408) 559-1200 voice other (800) 538-5005 FAX US  The MCT-AIO+ (and the \\\"+\\\" is important) sells for $89.95.

I have heard from several people about less expensive m-f I/O cards with 16550s:  TSD Systems (407) 331-9130 $19.95 for the card, plus $9.95 per 16550.  Greenfield Trading and Distributors (518) 271-2473 (voice), (518) 271-7811(FAX). Their card is $33 w/one 16550, $45 w/2, and they sell 16550AFNs for $13.

Meanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports, and am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based 8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set the internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.   The Software Situation  Simply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun problems.  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the 16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1 drivers have the following limitations:  - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.  - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt    rate of 10x during uploads.  - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2    more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).  - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.    With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1    or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would    be effective.  - The API won't accept rates above \\\"CBR_128000\\\".  - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even    if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit    from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.  - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.  - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.  - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port    speed options above 19200 bps.  These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0). Rumors suggest they \\\"may\\\" be solved in Windows \\\"4.0\\\".  You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of \\\"TurboCom\\\", current version 1.2, from:  Bio-Engineering Research Pacific CommWare Division 180 Beacon Hill Lane Ashland  OR   97520-9701 (503) 482-2744 voice (503) 482-2627 FAX (503) 482-2633 BBS MCImail:    344-5374 CompuServe: 71521,760  Price was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit cards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom but as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software company per se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for an in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a market for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They recently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.  I now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my datacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps when linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O. Uploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts are still using antique UARTs and drivers.  Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the Windows APIs and dialog boxes.  I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you do the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC) standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another 16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving system or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all by itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above 115,200 may still be risky.  Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to buy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a 16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of TurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of \\\"Windows Sources\\\" magazine. I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a \\\"power user\\\" whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems.   Closing Soapbox Comments  The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface, the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation vendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was subsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the exception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent I/O.  You may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this situation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect cries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs \\\"sort of\\\" work today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a hardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that use that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.

Also, it is very dry in these cities, so I will tend to drink a lot of water, and keep away from dehydrating drinks, such as those containing caffeine or alcohol.  Thing is, I still have symptoms.  How can I ensure that my short trips there (no, I don't usually have a week to acclimatize) are as comfortable as possible? Is there something else that I could do?  A long time ago (possibly two years ago) there was a discussion here about altitude adjustment.  Has anyone saved the messages?  Many thanks,\",\"Well, the Red Sox have apparenly resigned Herm Winningham to a AAA contract.

One approach is simply to try and move political opinion and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Another approach is to try and amend the constitution.  The original constitution restrained the U.S. government from economic intervention for 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it. The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrains government (particularly state and local), even though on many particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I think libertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via an amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).  Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this as a problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That might be true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  If a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then falls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.  This is unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now, but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of, if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.\",\"I have several books which I really wish to sell.

Even modifying the core to match some arbitrary key is not difficult to do at home. I once knew someone who had fixed his locks in this way - his house, office and cars all took the same key (which he took GOOD care of :-)        Very bad (yours, that is). Have you ever had a safety deposit box? They work on a two-key system. The bank clerk has one, and you have the other (they are different keys). The bank does NOT keep a copy of your key. If you lose it, they have to drill out the lock, and replace the door. This is a time consuming and expensive process (which they will be happy to charge to your account :-).       This process is exactly analogous to having a private key which is NOT in a escrow system, and the state having to crack your cipher to get the data.

With those reports about : Bosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that : the massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered : me was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I : shouldn't be so troubled about the reports of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" in : Bosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims. : Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians : who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing : God's work?  Perhaps it would be useful to ask whether those doing the ethnic cleansing could be said to be loving those they are killing in the very act of killing.  Does it reflect the attitude of God, who sends rain to both the just and the unjust?  If not, then Christians should be uncomfortable with it.  Jesus gave his followers the law of love to follow and it is by exhibiting this that disciples will be known.  Doctrinal (or political) correctness is not the standard, so I don't see why Christians should be moved against the Serbs because their ancestors converted from Christianity to Islam.  It seems to me that as a Christian you _should_ be troubled by the ethnic cleansing. -- \",\" Can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let's, for argument's sake, define \\\"rushed\\\" as brought up to the majors for more than a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below expectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing?  I'm serious; I tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but I'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are any.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can look up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).    Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was \\\"rushed\\\", although there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the next year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job, and has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was performed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being \\\"rushed\\\"; Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have been less likely to give up on him.  Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.  But does that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts performing up to expectations?\",\"I am auctioning off the following comics.

I don't think it is the function overloading at all-- I do that sort of thing all of the time in BC++ without a hitch.  The big problems I have encountered in porting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of invalid C++ assumptions.  I have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but the reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in which static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are getting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the owner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all other pieces of ctrltest work fine.  Two other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:  - The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,   rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ   between MSC and BC).  - All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++   assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place   of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for   references).  I am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have not encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope that some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS's hype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that. \",\"  I think there is a legal clause in the RR name, regardless of who owns it it must be a British company/owner - i.e. BA can sell the company but not the name.\",\"The PowerBook 170 4/40 with Fax/Data modem is available thru CitiBank's CitiDollars catalog for $1995.00 + $19.95 S/H (+ 500 CitiDollars).

The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is a one-way hash function? * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.? * What are MD4 and MD5? * What is Snefru?   * What is a one-way hash function?    A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and   produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally   impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't   determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not   even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also   computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the   same hash.    A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an   encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash   function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are   relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user   is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,   and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the   signature can do the same thing.    Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.  * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?    There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a   very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which   isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it   a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption   functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have   hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1   if and only if X = H(M).    A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private   decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the   previous question, have public hashing and public verification.   Digital signature functions have private hashing and public   verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,   but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.    Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to   be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real   difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key   isn't published, so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend   rather than ``for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing   ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No.  * What are MD4 and MD5?    MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest.   Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 (see part 10). Code is   available from [FTPMD].    Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft   RFC. The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a, though some   people refer to it as MD5.  * What is Snefru?\",\"I have a Diamond Speedstar 24X board that I want to program for 24 bit 640x480 graphics, or possibly 800x600 16 bit color.

In fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete for physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and  undermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care.   Once again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney dialysis.  Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services to a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service. Otherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the vast expansion that has occurred.   Can you spell \\\"loss leader?\\\"  I knew you could.  Grocery stores do not attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of it.  In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader  for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.    But the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears that price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of service and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide  comparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had  risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.  There is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD  substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday predictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction of service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears that in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers  are government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.   (RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to Seattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)    The bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government  intervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial results for both providers and consumers.  Claims that \\\"government bureaucracy\\\" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace should take such such cases into account.  jsh \",\"The message from the NIST about the clipper chip comes from the following address:   clipper@csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (Clipper Chip Announcement)  Just who is that, I asked myself, or rather, I asked the computer.      % telnet csrc.ncsl.nist.gov 25     Trying...

The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them. They certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this was not necessarily their true position.   The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question. The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914 and David Llloyd George's budget. Even despite this the House of Lords has considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body.     The system is meant to be slow to react, the problem is that it ended up a bit too slow.    The Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely separate. Until Bush abused it in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent of being a check on unreasonable legislation. The veto was clearly regarded  as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive.\",\"The subject says what I would like to do, here are the details:  I have a 512ke with the MacRescue upgrade board that makes it the equivalent of a Plus (System 7 and MacEnvy both identify it as such).  The MacRescue board clips onto the 68000 on the MB.  It also has a 68000 itself.  Periodically I have to remove the clip (not an entirely easy thing to do) and clean the \\\"legs\\\" of the 68000. Larry Pina's book asserts that this is occasionally a problem with snap on upgrades:  the 68000's \\\"legs\\\" will oxidize, causing  unusual system errors.  Well, that's me.  So, I would like to do something permanent, and I think it would be fairly easy to put a socket in where the 68000 currently is, and modify the MacRescue board to plug in.  What I'm not 100% sure of is whether it will work.  It seems to me that the two 68000s aren't acting independently; so removing one shouldn't have any effect on the performance of my Mac.  I'm about 97% sure.  Will someone provide the extra 3%?\",\"    As for advertising -- sure, why not?  A NASA friend and I spent one    drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar we'd need    to put the golden arches of a certain American fast food organization    on the face of the Moon.  Fortunately, we sobered up in the morning.  Hmmm. It actually isn't all that much, is it? Like about 2 million km^2 (if you think that sounds like a lot, it's only a few tens of m^2 per burger that said organization sold last year). You'd be best off with a reflective substance that could be sprayed thinly by an unmanned craft in lunar orbit (or, rather, a large set of such craft). If you can get a reasonable albedo it would be visible even at new moon (since the moon itself is quite dark), and _bright_ at full moon. You might have to abandon the colour, though.  Buy a cheap launch system, design reusable moon -> lunar orbit unmanned spraying craft, build 50 said craft, establish a lunar base to extract TiO2 (say: for colour you'd be better off with a sulphur compound, I suppose) and some sort of propellant, and Bob's your uncle.  I'll do it for, say, 20 billion dollars (plus changes of identity for me and all my loved ones). Delivery date 2010.  Can we get the fast-food chain bidding against the fizzy-drink vendors? Who else might be interested?  Would they buy it, given that it's a _lot_ more expensive, and not much more impressive, than putting a large set of several-km inflatable billboards in LEO (or in GEO, visible 24 hours from your key growth market). I'll do _that_ for only $5bn (and the changes of identity).\",\" Battery powered devices like the PowerBook are sometimes more sensitive to  serial port weirdness.  I had trouble with connecting my Mac Plus to an HP 95LX handheld.  Everything else worked okay on that port, but not the HP. (it runs on two penlite batteries).  It turned out that the plus (by accident or by  design flaw?) was putting a 4 volt bias on the serial port that was doing  weird things to the HP (which has only 3v dc!).  The HP worked fine when  connected to the printer port.    Does your PB screen get dim or anything when connected to the device?  Have you  tried using the printer port?  Good luck.   --jamie \",\"   The *POWER* of the word processor and a stamp at work.

I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, I have other xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning.  In case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles, here's a crude picture:   ====================== Figure 1 ====================================  |  |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+  |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C +  |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+  |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C, but +  |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  +  |    +      window, window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     +  |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+  |  ====================== Figure 1 ====================================  Squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack, with easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really need, since I also insist on having a virtual WM.  The only problem is that the title location is static, that is,  it is configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and time-consuming.  Therefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right } functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click of a button, you can change this:      +---------+     + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+  to this:                     +---------+                    + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+   ===============  Okay. So far, so good. Now, how the heck do I get them to put this into the next \\\"official\\\" twm, and the next tvtwm, and the next vtwm, and the next ctwm? And the next xyztwm that I never heard of?  One way would be to post, in comp.windows.x, a description of this enhancement, together with an explanation of why I think it is a Very Good Thing, and hope that someone reads it. :-)  In case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing, look back up at Figure 1, and picture window A moved over on top of windows B and C; now window A's title hides Window B's title; but when you hit f.squeezecenter, the result is:          +=========+   +---------+   +=========+         + title B +   + title A +   + title C +         +-------------------------------------+         +   this is the body of the window,   +         +   window A, which is on top.        +         +-------------------------------------+   ===================  The rest of this posting explains how to implement it, based on my X11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the full diffs would be too long.  The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the ExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c:  #ifdef SHAPE  case F_SQUEEZELEFT:  { static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT, 0, 0 };   if (DeferExecution (context, func, Scr->SelectCursor))     return TRUE;    tmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze;   SetFrameShape( tmp_win );   break;  }  .... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and  squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ... #endif  ( Of course, you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h   and add     { \\\"f.squeezeleft\\\", FKEYWORD, F_SQUEEZELEFT },      ... and so forth ... to parse.c  In order to use these functions, add something like the following to your .twmrc file:  Button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter   =================  About a year ago, I posted this, but our news was broken and I *think* it didn't get out.  Since then, \\\"blast\\\" has appeared in comp.sources.x, Volume 19, Issue 41; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect, by chiseling away at an mwm-style wide title.

God is just, giving to everyone what they deserve. As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf Romans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.  Hence, the unbaptized infants are cut off from the God against whom they, with the whole of the human race except Mary, have sinned.  Which is why Jesus said, \\\"Truly, truly I say to you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless he is born of water and Spirit\\\" which is the true meaning of born again (John 3.5).  Thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be cut off from God and exlcuded from heaven.

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers) =====================================================================  I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?  1. Free options  The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.  Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will  be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86  is listed below.   X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was  done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).  It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.  There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,  X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you  don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?  3. What is XFree86?     XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with    X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and    other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:      1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,        selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require        an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of        1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by        default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield        up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.     2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default        operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now        equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately        20% faster than X386 1.2.     3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,        or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4        with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from        SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.     4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.        Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about        the ATI and Trident drivers.     5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's        code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).     6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is        compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the        contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.     7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font        renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary        distributions.     8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.     9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA        cards is now included.     The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2    (they were not in XFree86 1.1):      1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of        available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200         (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).     2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the        monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \\\"two        headed\\\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only        been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).     3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.     4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to        consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for        more information.)     5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some         versions of these devices were not previously compatible).     6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor        timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous        documentation and a lot of experimentation).     7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including        implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many         vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more         information).     8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has        been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of        0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks        line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.     9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig        configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative        and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new        options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1)         manual page for more information on the format of this file).         Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file        in the source distribution for full details.     Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the    current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.  4. What OSs are supported?      XFree86 supports:  SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2  SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC  SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2  Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1   BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active  BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.   Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,  but anyone should feel free to submit patches.  If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to  xfree86@physics.su.oz.au  5. What video hardware is supported?     At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:   Tseng ET4000  Tseng ET3000  Paradise PVGA1  Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of   the PVGA1, and use its driver)  Genoa GVGA  Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000  ATI 18800, 28800   All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,  with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in  256 color mode.   The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of  video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the  ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome  server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.   It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to  non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To  avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86  1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel  clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are  discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how  these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such  a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with  future XFree86 releases.   If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,  it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the  Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not  work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.  In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond  products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions  of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).  If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.   Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA  video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the  CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It  could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset  on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot  of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested  theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not  working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86  working fine on them.  6. What about accelerated boards?   At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards  like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available  in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).   An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact  <hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.   A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>  or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.  7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?   The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the  16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory  contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-  planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each  of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-  buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled  16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code  could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).  But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer  implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,  but nothing is yet available from the project.  8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?   Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run  X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.  The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending  on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).  To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will  be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable   lower bound.  9. Where can I get source for XFree86?   Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22  from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:   export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)   ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)   ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)  (For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)   Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information  on which files you need to get to build your distribution.  10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?   Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from:   ftp.physics.su.oz.au  - SVR4 binaries    under /XFree86/SVR4   ftp.win.tue.nl   - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/XFree86/SVR4   ferkel.ucsb.edu   - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/SVR4/XFree86   stasi.bradley.edu  - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/XFree86/SVR4   blancmange.ma.utexas.edu - SVR3 (ISC) binaries    under /pub/ISC   ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries    under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86   tsx-11.mit.edu   - Linux binaries    under /pub/linux/packages/X11   agate.berkeley.edu  - 386BSD binaries    under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86   ftp.cs.uwm.edu   - Mach binaries    under /i386   Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may  archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will  contain a README file that describes what files you need to take  from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were  made when building the distribution.  IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?  11. Installation directories   The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot  (/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include  files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.   This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified  via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is  nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed  alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.  12. Configuration files   The XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\\\"Xconfig\\\") on startup.  The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in  the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.  13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes   David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known  clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.  The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and  is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is  also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on  export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated  occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the  settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to  David for inclusion in the database.   If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file   with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.  It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use  this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information  to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.   NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and        is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot        clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from        your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The        server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.        You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your        Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up        starting the server in the future.  14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit   If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to  reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is  fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.  V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?   First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).  15. SVR4  Why won't my xterm run properly?   If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define  CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.  csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'   The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping  problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be  installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.  16. SVR3   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.  17. 386BSD   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.   Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey  <Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the  file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:       agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2      wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2      grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2  18. Linux   You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc  jump libraries installed.   Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.   If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to  run the server as \\\"X -pn\\\". The default startup configuration assumes  that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files  /usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the  -pn argument to X386.   Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major  number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not  owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit  console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but  startx won't.   When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with  a tty, for example \\\"xdm < /dev/console &\\\".   For more detailed information, please read the file README present  with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.  19. Mach   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.  VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?   This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is  fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.  Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.  VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?  20. BSD compatibility library   A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.  The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a  which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),  seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include  <X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro  definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are  linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these  functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a  21. ANSICCOPTIONS   This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the  ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite  the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see  something like   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of   ANSICCOPTIONS=\\\"-ansi\\\"   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:   ANSICCOPTIONS=  to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death  with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because  CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must  add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.  XFree86 Contact Information      Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86     Core Team.  At this time the Core Team consists of:   The original \\\"gang of four\\\":   David Dawes <dawes@physics.su.oz.au>   Glenn Lai <glenn@cs.utexas.edu>   Jim Tsillas <jtsilla@damon.ccs.northeastern.edu>   David Wexelblat <dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com>   Those supporting non-SYSV operating systems:   Robert Baron <Robert.Baron@ernst.mach.cs.cmu.edu> [Mach]   Rich Murphey <Rich@Rice.edu> [386BSD]   Orest Zborowski <obz@kodak.com> [Linux]      e-mail sent to <xfree86@physics.su.oz.au> will reach all of the core team.   --------------------------------------------------  Thanks to all the people who already sent me corrections or additions, especially David Wexelblat (one of the major contributors of updates).\",\"  There were many injustices in the middle ages.  And this is truely sad. I would hate to see a day when churches put people to death or torchured them for practicing homosexuality, or any other crime.  The church is not called to take over the governments of the world.  It may be that homosexuals treated cruelly today, but that does not mean that we should teach  Christians to practice homosexual immorality.  Do you think that we should also teach Christians to practice divination and channelling because the witches in the middle ages were persecuted.    And you accuse me of judging?  When did you look into my heart and see if I have love.  I have been writing that we should not teach Christians to practice homosexual immorality, and you pretend to have divine knowledge to look into my heart.  I can't say that I love homosexuals as I should- I can't say that I love my neighbor as I should either.  I don't know very many homosexuals as it is.    But Jesus loves homosexuals, just as He loves everyone else.  If His love were conditional, I not know Him at all.  Yes.  We should show love to  homosexuals, but it is not love to encourage brothers in the church to  stumble and continue in their sin.  That is a very damaging and dangerous  thing.   That is slander.   I could just as easily say  that NAMBLA has been able to implement legislation to make child molesting easier because of the tearing down of societies morality due to people accepting homosexuality as normal, and that this is what you are embracing.  I do believe that homosexual sex is immoral, that does not mean I endorse using violence against them.  There is a problem of hatred in the church.  But there is also the problem of what has been called \\\"unsanctified mercy.\\\" Many in the conservative churches have seen the moral breakdown in  this country and the storm on the horizon, and have gotten militant in  the flesh.  This is truely sad.  Yet others in other churches have  embraced immorality in society, and have pointed to the carnality in the conservative churches to justify their actions.     Certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus. But we shouldn't water down the gospel to draw people in.  Jesus didn't go out of His way to show only what might be considered positive aspects to draw people in.  He told one man to sell all He had.  He told another not to say good bye to His family.  His words were hard at times. We should present people with the cost of the tower before we allow them to begin construction.  many people have already been innoculated to the gospel.  Link Hudson.   \",\" Since we are talking in theory and opinion, then I'll put in my $.02.  First, a rebuttle. Personally, I love under-dogs. Unlike  bandwagon jumpers, I abandon teams when they start winning. People that cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are afraid to be associated with something negative.   On this one point, I agree. The reason that people bash WASP's is  because they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top is going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top. If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people  for all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had  conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any better/worse than the whites did.  The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of the world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done (ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to the present generation who didn't participate in the crimes? Would it do  any good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stopped hundreds, even thousands, of years ago.   My opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let's change them. But don't blame me for what my ancestors did. It wouldn't settle anything anyway.   That's where you are dead wrong. You don't join up on a side just because they are winning. That makes you spineless. Winning, in high school and after high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't make you right. All the best causes in history were loosing causes (with only a couple exceptions). Winning only makes a difference to other people, not to yourself. And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care how you appear (ie. a Winner).   If you can't beat them, fight them every inch of the way.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \\\"At that moment the bottom fell out of Authur's mind.

Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll try to get better.  Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far, only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.  Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K.  vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.   I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with his set of excuses.    I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.  From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I  see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away from the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see the dialog:   Me:  \\\"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\\\"   BK:  \\\"There is no truck.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around at look.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at      the oncoming truck.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around or you will run over.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\\\"  Me:  \\\"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing       to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\\\"       I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.  BK:  \\\"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.       Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\\\"       And by the way, I really have an open mind.\\\"   So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?     I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have. I can now see the truck behind Brian.  My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment, Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his head will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. \",\" As a followup, this is a co-worker's machine.  He has the latest 2.03 drivers.

It has been used for 1 season on my sailboat.     All parts are included as well as the installation instructions. It is even packed in the original box it came in. There is no damage to the unit or the transducer. In fact, the transducer was mounted *inside* the hull in a piece of pipe glued to the hull. So it led a \\\"sheltered\\\" life. The transducer can be mounted either inside the hull as I did, or on the transom. It cannot be placed in a hole drilled into your hull.   It is fully waterproof and fits into a 2\\\" hole in a bulkhead (that's where I had it installed) or into a standard dashboard on a powerboat. It reads depth to 199' and has a backlit LCD display. It has an adjustable shallow water alarm built in.    I am changing out my instruments to another manufacturer that outputs the NMEA 0183 information. This little depth sounder works fine and is very stable.    It is usually priced as low as 130$ in some catalogs, I paid 150$.    The first 80$ takes it, or best offer.         John R.

Something along the lines of   etherfind -t -x -n  | dd bs=1k count=10 2>/dev/null | md5 should do the trick. -t gives you timestamps, and the lack of -u makes sure that dd does not get ten lines as opposed to ten K.

The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example, was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign. His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie year.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound.  Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had good numbers immediately.  I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it didn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.

Chris\",\"I have found Jewish people very imagentative and creative. Jewish religion was the foundation for Christianity and Islam.  In other words Judaism has fathered both religions. Now Islam has turned against its father I may say. It is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone, religion wars are going to be on the raise.  I thought the idea of believing on one God, was to Unite all man kind. How come both Jews and Islam which believe on the same God, \\\"the God of Ebrahim\\\" are killing each other? Is this like Dr. Frankenstien's story? How are you going to stop this from happening? How are you going to deal with so many Muslims. Nuking them  would distroy the whole world? Would God get mad, since you have killed his followers, you believe on the same God, same heaven and the same hell after all? What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga?   Man kind needs religion, since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state. A religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society. The praying, keeps the sole healthy and meditates it. God does not care for man kinds pray, but man kind hopes that God will help him when he prays. Religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life. But the  religious leaders need to make a living through religion? So they  may corrupt it, or turn it to their own way to make their living. i.e Muslims have to pay  %20 percent of their income to the Mullahs. I guess the rabie  gets his cut too!   Is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other, be good toward each other helps one another, respect the mother nature. Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts  that we take today?  Is in it that within every man there is good and bad, he could choose either one, then he will see the outcome of his choice.  How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion. How can we stop another religious killing field, under poor Gods name? What are your thoughts? Do you think man kind would to come its senses, before it is too late?   P.S. on the side  Do you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina? Why would God go to top of the mountain? He created the earth, he could have been anywhere? why on top the mountain? Was it because people thought to see God you have to reach to the skies/heavens? Why God kept coming back to Middle East? Was it because they created God through their imagination?  Is that why Jewish people were told by God, they were the chosen ones?  Profit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh. She was a Jewish. She taught him how to trade. She probably taught him about Judaism. Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah (sp? old testement). Do you think God wrote Quran? Makeh was a trade city before Islam. Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammad wanted to expand his trade business? Is that why  God has put his house in there?   I think this religious stuff has gone too far. All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up. Look at David Koresh, how that turned out? I am afraid in the bigger scale, the Jews and the Muslims will have the same ending!!!!!!!!  Religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things, rather than plotting each others distruction.  There is one earth, One life and one God. Let's all man kind be good toward each other.\",\"  Oops! Quite right. I got so busy that I saved Frank's last post back then, intending to respond when I could, and I sort of forgot.

I developed my own method, which requires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn method.  It uses few calculations however, basically it is several comparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of something, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so merely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.

Thanks\",\"A few comments on the ATF's botched handling of this case:  1. Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight?  The explanation    we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult    members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit    of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,    you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule    is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is    incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.  2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were    outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When    questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault    was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were    thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew    you could!  3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,    hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and    referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm    more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not    related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up    some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's    now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by    the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I    was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI    agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say    uncomplimentary.  4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that    the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the    reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing    this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references    to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around    the \\\"He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!\\\"    flag.  Sigh.  5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege    reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought    processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button    because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My    only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to    the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to    an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in    the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the    forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In    that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones    Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:    Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and    other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the    BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have    been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.

Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/- comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way play.  In my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the other hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get 90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.  (By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.

While I can't offer such a proof, it seems pretty damn plausible that if the government does not regulate a particular area, it cannot become a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area. I rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have NOW that is more likely to become such a tool, and that it IS such a tool in many instances.

Your boss should be the person bring these problems to.  If he/she does not seem to take any action, keep going up higher and higher. Sexual harrassment does not need to be tolerated, and it can be an enormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that they are trying to do something about it.  If you feel you can not discuss this with your boss, perhaps your company has a personnel department that can work for you while preserving your privacy.  Most companies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety does seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs.  It is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not.  It is not inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee problems/strife even after eight years (it's a miracle if they do notice).  Perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of higher ups?  If the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the entire problem, there may be a state agency willing to fight with you.  (check with a lawyer, a women's resource center, etc to find out)  You may also want to discuss this with your paster, priest, husband, etc.  That is, someone you know will not be judgemental and that is supportive, comforting, etc.  This will bring a lot of healing.

If you don't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the BuilderXcessory file is. You can do this using the setenv command under csh.

Since we apparently don't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing cameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests are going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with the video being piped into a command center they're building somewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers or cheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large multi-colored status displays will show the various routes using different colors to represent the various average speeds for each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front of the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic status to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently also looking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to providing continuous audio from this system.  In the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data on traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the system is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it will be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read \\\"cheap\\\").  We also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP audio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal reports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle receivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is applicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using some other TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your stereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information. I believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle receivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly fees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers don't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely true), they likely have no investment in keeping the system up and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You may have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing more, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;)  I think we'd all be interested in a summary post if you get more info on how the LA system is networked and paid for.\",\"[...]  With all the activity in sci.crypt these past few days, I am not supprised you missed it...

The Azerbaijani fighters found 16 bodies of civilians, including those of a child and two elderly women who were shot point-blank, \\\"and survivors were killed by a shot to the back of the head,\\\" said a ministry statement, carried by the Azerbaijani Azerinform and Turan news agencies and the ITAR-Tass news service.    \\\"Everywhere Armenian occupants were, they left tens of corpses of civilians shot to death point-blank and mutilated,\\\" the...   Serdar Argic\",\" Size of armies, duration, numbers of casualties both absolute and as a percentage of those involved, geographical area and numbers of countries too, are all measures of size.  In this case I'd say the relevant statistic would be the number of combatants (total troops) compared to total casualties from among the total civilian population in the affected geographical area.   Vietnam and Korea might make good comparisons.   Western news in general, but in particular the American \\\"mass media\\\": CBS, NBC, ABC, etc.  The general tone of the news during the whole war was one of \\\"those poor, poor Iraqis\\\" along with \\\"look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits\\\".   I agree.   Perhaps so.  And maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too.  But that's easy to say from our \\\"enlightened\\\" viewpoint here in the 90's, right?  Back then, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed. After all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of  thousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and  millions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and  other people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.  All  things considered, the fire-bombings and the atomic bomb were essential (and therefore justified) in bringing the war to a quick end to avoid even greater allied losses.  I, for one, don't regret it.   Sure.  And it's the people who suffer because of them.  All the more reason to depose these \\\"entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests\\\"!  Or do you mean that this applies to the allies as well??   I make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the West before the war.  It is evident that the West, especially America, misjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and  threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's oil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West before Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is responsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a strong response from the West was required.   Well, it's not very \\\"loving\\\" to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep them.  Or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, I'd have to say yes, stopping Hussein was the most \\\"loving\\\" thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.  I mentioned it.  If we hadn't intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would have been appeasement.  It is precisely the lessons the world learned in WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.  Letting Hitler take Austria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW2 from happening, and letting Hussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to protect Saudi Arabia.   Sure.  What was truly unfortunate was that they followed Hitler in his grandiose quest for a \\\"Thousand Year Reich\\\".  The consequences stemmed from that.  What should I say about them?  Anything in particular?    So?  It was the *policemen* on trial not Rodney King!!  And under American law they deserved a jury of *their* peers!  If there had been black officers involved, I'm sure their would have been black jurors too. This point (of allegedly racial motivations) is really shallow.   So?  It's \\\"hard to imagine\\\"?  So when has Argument from Incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of \\\"Constructing a Logical Argument\\\"?  Can we expect another revision soon??  :)  (Just kidding.)   I have to admit that I wonder this too.  But *neither* the prosecution nor the defense is talking.  So one cannot conclude either way due to the silence of the principals.     OK.  It certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved. And frankly, the original \\\"not guilty\\\" verdict baffled me too.  But then I learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably would have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, which news commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under California law.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it's evident that  the first jury decided that the officers were \\\"not guilty\\\".  Note,  not \\\"not guilty\\\" of doing wrong, but \\\"not guilty\\\" of aggravated assault  with the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  The seeds of the  prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a  verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.  If the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, then I feel the \\\"not guilty\\\" verdict was a reasonable one.   Thanks mathew, I like the quote.  Pretty funny actually.  (I'm a  Monty Python fan, you know.  Kind of seems in that vein.)  Of course, oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem contradictory.  But then, you know that already.

The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was because of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by scanning this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines).  When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \\\"I want to play a mono sound\\\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted the documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound.  Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from the IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.  Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware, and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase works. On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra 700/900/950 at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel only. Both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification, but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.  If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their games will only come out the left on some games.  The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related. It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what machine you have.  Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list: and also Hellcats, Super Tetris Oxyd (and many more, these are just what I've tested)  Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.   Other games you list: and also PGA Tour Golf Civilization (and more, these are again only from personal experience)  Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.  The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT! Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to do, but I'm going say it anyway. Stop cheating on sound! Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period is about to end. The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will work even better soon, so use it.  In conclusion: To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug. To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all hardware.   Have fun.  Disclaimer number 1: I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed. So don't write me with sound questions.  Disclaimer number 2: If it says up above that I wrote anything like \\\"the grace period is about to end\\\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.  Disclaimer number 3: I don't speak for Apple, just me.\",\"  DEC does this only for their PX and PXG servers, known as 3D accelerators.

If you don't, or if you observe things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen, then you have some  evidence against the theory.  If the theory can't be modified to  incorporate the new observations, then you say that it is false.  For example, people used to believe that the earth had been created 10,000 years ago.

I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.          (using block-mode transfers) I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can          achieve 6.8 MB/s.  Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.  It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer, then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s result in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)  So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer,   Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer. Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer. Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.         ... Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer. Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card.  Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously, and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho') each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.  Why?  Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time.) Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use the same bus to mac RAM?  Is there anything I can do?\",\"If the heading is true, Mr. Frank should be ashamed of himself.

MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.              Q   Why?              MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.                Q   What about the lunch?              MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.              Q   Is he meeting with any congress people today?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.              Q   There are no meetings --              MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today,  no.              Q   Has the President been given any information by the  Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report  from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the  Vietnamese on that subject?              MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order  of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll  discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the  parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't  drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's  something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese  about first.              Q   Did the President talk with any Republican senators  yesterday about the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.              Q   How many times?              MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last  night.              Q   What was the outcome of that?              MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind  of an agreement on a jobs package.              Q   Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any  way flexible on this?              MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going  to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll  continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some  kind of an agreement.              Q   Did they discuss the VAT tax?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.              Q   Can you check that?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.        Q   So what are they -- is the President offering to  scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down  to where Dole will sign on?              MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it  as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs  package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as  we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the  moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress  including, obviously, Senator Dole.              Q   Is he talking to anybody else?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other  Republicans yesterday.              Q   Is he talking to anybody today?              MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I  wouldn't rule it out.              Q   We were led to believe that the President called  Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the  conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?              MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several  people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the  stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation  he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the  conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business,  but it was both.              Q   In the President's mind, are they linked  politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the  stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to  the American people?  Has he made that argument?              MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what  arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed  to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people  first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional  Russian aid last night in Tokyo.              Q   But does the President believe that the stimulus  package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for  Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?              MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to  continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs  package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs  package through the Congress.              Q   Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating  now with Dole?              MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.              Q   On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over  the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they  had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the  Senate for the jobs package.              Q   But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other  than Shelby?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a  vote.              Q   What about Kohl?              Q   Kohl and Feingold?              MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll  continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to  bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of  the members of the United States Senate support the package.              Q   If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold,  why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?              MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of  projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose  funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.              Q   No Democrats.  (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.              Q   Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any  other Republicans again today?              MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but  again, I wouldn't rule it out.              Q   Does he plan to put out any more press releases to  any other states today?              MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of  breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I  think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those  up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest  how their states would benefit from this package.              Q   Will you share those with us?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.              Q   Do you have copies of the ones you sent --              MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And  we certainly can continue to provide them today.              Q   Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent  stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has  been given?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think  the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was  something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he  has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add  to that.              Q   But he also said that business and labor groups are  telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --              MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going  to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that  there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't  think he said he was directly contacted by them.              Q   Are we to take that to mean that the administration  has sounded out business and labor groups on this --              MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public  discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think  I want to add to that.              Q   In February, though, the President said that this  was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What  has happened between then and now to cause this administration to  change its mind?              MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is  something that the working groups are looking at.  They're  considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to  specific options that will be covered by the President's health care  plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision  on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.              Q   You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being  considered by anyone in the White House after the President's  comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.              Q   And then suddenly --              Q   What happened?        MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said  throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options  across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about  and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added  tax.        Q   But the President himself took this off the table,  Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility  of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?        MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it  hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are  looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and  no decisions have been made.        Q   And it raises the question of how independently the  task force is working.        MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider  all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're  considering all options.        Q   But that's not the impression that the President  left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something  that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The  clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was  not on the table, not an option.         Q   \\\"If it changes I'll tell you.\\\"              Q   Bring him on.        Q   And you repeatedly referred to the President's  remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.              MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)              Q   But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna  Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an  orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers  --        MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a  Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not  orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last  couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We  confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.        Q   Is it because he has very few options?        Q   Is this something that it will be incumbent upon  the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has  the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the  task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in  fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with  the President?          MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at  this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their  mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and  the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I  think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that  context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been  made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a  decision on.        Q   They will present it to him as one of his options,  though he specifically ruled it out?        MS. MYERS:  Correct.        Q   Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is  this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to  this form of taxation?        MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The  working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number  of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that  they're looking at is the VAT.         Q   Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining  this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period  that you were telling us that it was not?        MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of  their drafting of options is.  I don't know.        Q   Who was telling you that it was not under  consideration?        MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's  comments.        Q   Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise  enough money to fund the core benefit package?        MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made  on how to pay for the health care plan.              Q   I'm asking whether the projections --              MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how  the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going  to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so  you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out  until you know.        Q   Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer  models on a number of possible packages.        MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q   The question is whether they have now determined  whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest  minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.        MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're  not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being  considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact  details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for  them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.                Q   And when the President has been meeting with health  care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing  --              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q      they have never once said to him, these are your  funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT  in his --              MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific  nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular  briefings.              Q   Well, you have.              MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not  considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.              Q   No, but you said that it has not been presented to  him as an option.              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of  what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.              Q      specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't  looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of  paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?   Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it  works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --              MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if  you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical  discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were  generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly,  it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean,  that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process  of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.   It's something that the working groups will present to him among the  number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not  going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where  health care issues are being discussed.              Q   It's your statement from this podium that no  discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that  the option has not been presented to him.              MS. MYERS:  That is correct.              Q   Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand  by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?              MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have  nothing to add to what's already been said.              Q   Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin  said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or  considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made  so that it would be less regressive?              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what  might happen if.              Q   But do you stand by the previous conversations in  February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said  you'd exclude food and energy --              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific  structure of a decision that hasn't been made.              Q   Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's  comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working  groups?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --              Q   Could you check for us, because that's a real  important credibility question?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.              Q   Since the task force was brought together this  issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one  fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in  the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month  and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be  considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?              MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.   It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has  not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to  add.              Q   Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of  questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem  with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if  you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered  while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if  it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading  us.              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come  out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.              Q   Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to  indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --              MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or  deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about  this issue.              Q   All we were trying to find out --              MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out  and I've given you the answers, Helen.              Q   We're trying to find out what changed -- what made  it an option again.  That's the --              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.                Q   Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you  investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?              MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously  considering and the President has not made a decision on.              Q   Yes, but he took it off the table in February.              MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll  present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.              Q   Why would they consider it if he has taken it off  the table?              MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table.               Q   Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change  his mind?              MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.              Q   Did he change his mind?              MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a  decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's  something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on  this we'll let you know.              Q   So he must have changed his mind, right?              MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean,  --              Q   Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he  changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority  exceeds the President's.              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to look at all options; they've done that.              Q   Are you going to put out his income tax?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on  his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be  available.               Q   Will there be any kind of briefing to go through  it?              MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will  be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you  through the questions.              Q   We're used to be walked line-by-line through the  presidential tax forms.              MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)              Q   Could we have one?              MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of  a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer  your questions about it.              Q   Did they file a joint form?              MS. MYERS:  Yes.              Q   When did he file it?              MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.              Q   Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for  Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the  meeting.              Q   No backgrounder today?              MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.              Q   This is complicated stuff.  We need help.   (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in  one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)              Q   Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of  force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it  out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your  thinking on whether or not to change your approach?              MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards  Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --              Q   But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they  people whose opinions would carry weight with you?              MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight  certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've  initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia,  although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the  Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on  to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options,  which we've been saying regularly.              Q   One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a  straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not  set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or  tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?              MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them  every day.              Q   Which doesn't work so --              MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.   We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we  support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on  the 26th.                Q   You say it's having an effect -- can you give us  any documentation?              MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to  you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.              Q   There's been no -- you have not been able to  provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any  effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.              MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia  and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be  happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if  you'd like.              Q   We would like to hear from someone who can show us  what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of  the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't  seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you  provide something along those lines?              MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.              Q   On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced  this morning -- where is that money coming from?              MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the  details of that package.              Q   So that would be new money that you would hope to  get?              MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the  $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have  seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in  Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.              Q   Isn't there a concern, though, about offering  something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the  concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.              MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do  something immediately, which required money that was already approved  in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit  longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we  announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional  approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to  work with Congress to make that happen.              Q   To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of  conversations with members and will continue to work with them as  this process moves forward.              Q   Was Christopher able to put this package out with a  fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with  Congress.              Q   In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is  that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and  the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs  package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help  give kids something to do.              Q   Who are they?              MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three  organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police  Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police  Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union  of Police Associations.              Q   Will the FBI chief be there?              MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.              Q   Or any other federal law enforcement officials?              MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these  national law enforcement organization leaders.              Q   Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the  $400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?              MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.              Q   So this would be the $700 million that's in the  budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?              MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700  million already in the budget.              Q   Is this going to be part of the supplemental or  Fiscal '94 --              MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact  funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.              Q   This $1.8 billion on top of --              MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400  million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.              Q   And this is what prompted the President to call Bob  Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was  calling Bob Dole?              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting  with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.              Q   Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some  Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are  complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House  and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the  other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these  Chambers of Commerce?              MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)   After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any  attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of  being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled  by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local  Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on  this and other initiatives.              Q   What's the status of the President thinking about  going to this Democratic retreat?              MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost  certainly go.              Q   All three days?              MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be  there yet.                Q   Is it open to coverage?              MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.              Q   Is he going to have any kind of address, statement,  anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?              MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't  made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or  what --              Q   Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it  out.              Q   What about an AIDS czar?              MS. MYERS:  It's coming.              Q   Anything on the weekend?              Q   There's been a suggestion that he's going to this  retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear  or have any involvement in the gay rights march.              MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been  discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic  retreat.              Q   The weekend?              MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on  right now is the radio address on Saturday.              Q   Any travel plans?              MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.              Q   He's not going to be off campaigning for his  stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.              Q   What about mid-week?  Anything likely?              MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely  that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.              Q   Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.              Q   Going to name a drug czar this weekend?              MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.              Q   And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going  to be focused on the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.              THE PRESS:  Thank you.\",\"Just kidding \",\"  In this era of AIDS, isn't someone's fucking *everyone's* interest?  (semi :-))  I propose \\\"We have no motto.\\\"  Recently in the glorious state of Maryland (the only state whose state song refers to Abraham Lincoln as a tyrant), people have gotten all wound up over the state motto (which we inherited from the Calverts):      \\\"Fatti Maschii, Parole Femine\\\"  which, if you read Italian, says,      \\\"Manly deeds, womanly words\\\"  or something to that effect.  In the state which not so long ago had four women out of seven representatives, this represents a problem.

I should probably leave this alone, but what the heck...   But didn't he credit the actual flag design to a party member - some dentist or other? I believe he gives such credit in Mein Kampf.   Well, I'm no expert, but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this. They make reference to several scandals that occurred long before \\\"the night of the long knives\\\". The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of the SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name escapes me at the moment) called \\\"Homosexuals in History\\\" asserts that Roehm and Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm's SA circle.   Well, you're the one who is in Germany. If you don't believe the history books, look up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not have access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of documented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the \\\"knight of the long knives\\\" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping together, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA's homosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I've  read make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me.    I know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do you know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have read concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that  all historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about  homosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don't you think they  would have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals? I would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one  should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case.    If you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving), then the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where the stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to archival material - most people on the net are not.   Eh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so that you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis might have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is true? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?  I don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were homosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious for its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German govt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser's friends were prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long tradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history - back to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a  product of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the English public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality, would have been quite willing to overlook Roehm's homosexuality.  In addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The Hitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various  pre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote  homoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So  it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis,  regardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the \\\"evils\\\" of homosexuality. Why should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all  societies - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.  No, I don't have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you will accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access  to these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern homosexuality that I have ever read - I don't have the time. Nothing is stopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove otherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.\",\"I have a (very old) Mac 512k and a Mac Plus, both of which  have the same problem.  Their screens blank out, sometimes after a minor physical jolt (such as inserting a floppy in the internal drive), sometimes  all by themselves (computer left to itself just goes blank).  I have replaced the wires connecting the logic boards and the  video board, because it seemed at first that jiggling the wires made the screen come back on.  This worked for a while, but the blanking out has returned.  Can I do anything?  Do I need a new power supply?  A new CRT? A new computer?

It's supposed to be a new treatment, and it's described in Nov. 1992 issue of J. of Obst. and Gyn.\",\" Not true! Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality at any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason for your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font vendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being hand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.  TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting of diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the Windows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can be done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not just converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.   Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.    Hope this clears up some of the confusion.

Actually, they are free to leave and seek work in Egypt, except that the Egyptians don't want them, either.  And who are you going to blame if/when Gazans establish their own state of Gaza/Palestine?   Actually, one such Jew who did risk his life to help Gazan Arabs was hacked to death by Palestinean murderers just last week.  It seems that the risk has been primarily from the Arabs \\\"in need of help\\\".   This is also true for telephone repairmen, traders who seek to buy agricultural products from Gazans, Israeli soldiers who get involved in fighting between feuding Palestinean groups that are as determined to destroy each other as they are to destroy outsiders...

I'm not going to read this posting of yours any further.     \",\"Recently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive (a Seagate 210MB, I can look up the model number if it's important) and I've been trying to help him install it.  [I've got a vested interest, since my machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed.] He already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD (again, I forget the model number but I can find out.)  Anyway, I can't seem to get the bloody thing up.  I've managed to get one or the other drive up (with the other disconnected), but not both at the same time; whenever I try, the thing hangs during bootup - never gets past the system test.  The IDE controller's instruction sheet says it supports two drives; I think I've configured the CMOS correctly; the power's plugged in properly; I even learned about the master/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn't know PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpers properly (the 85MB one is the master, the new 210MB one is the slave).  The only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong.  I've tried several combinations:  controller - master - slave controller - slave - master master - controller - slave  None of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can't think of any others.  Another possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into two seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for \\\"C: drive\\\" and \\\"D: drive\\\" setup info rather than \\\"drive 1\\\" and \\\"drive 2\\\" like most others I've seen.  Could this be confusing things?  So, I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs, except for some info for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paper about the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it's one of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle, so it looks like a serial connection); now I be lost!

CPUs Comparison List As a general rule of thumb Motorola chips are faster than Intel chips at the  same frequency {030/25 ~= 386/33; 040/25 ~= 486dx/50}, but Intel has chips at  higher frequencies than Motorola, so this evens out.  The Macintosh Bible 4th  ed. supports the comparisons between Intel and Motorola chips for the 68020  and above.  <=80186    ~ 68000 {16-bit vs 16/24/32-bit chip [data path/address  lines/data & address registers].  The 4MB limit on the 68000 Macs brings it  down to the 80186 and lower chips, otherwise it would compare to the 80286.}  286        ~ 68020 {hardware segmenting vs. 68020's 32-bit ALU and these chips  come have no usable built-in MMU unlike their successors [80386, 68030].  The  hardware segmenting's protected mode is used by OS/2 1.0 => and Windows 3.X.  The use of the hardware segmenting and their 16-bit nature put the 286 between  the 60000 and 68030 in features and the LC's 16-bit data path strenghthens the  286 ~ 68020 comparison.}  386       ~ 68030 {Two 32-bit chips with MMUs, and protected memory.  A/UX 3.0  is at present the only Mac OS to use the 68030's protected memory feature for  apps.  System 7.x uses this feature to protect a RAM disk created by the  Memory control panel but this is supported only on Powerbooks and Quadras.   The Color Classic and LCII 16-bit hardware data paths makes the 68030s in them  comparative to 386sxs.}  486sx   ~ 68LC040 {same as 486 and 68040 without the FPU; used as a low cost  solution for people who do not need the FPU.

These chips may flounder against the cheaper (PC Week 3/08/93;  4/12/93; PC Mag 4/27/93:110), earlier released (PC Week 12/7/92; MacWeek  12/14/92; PC Week 2/08/93), less leat producing {160 degrees F for Pentium (PC Mag 4/27/93:118)}, and partly ported to PowerPC chips.}   PowerPC   = PowerPC {This CPU line is planned to run programs from DOS,  Windows 3.x, OS/2 and Mac OS on top of PowerOpen-A/UX 4.0 [UNIX] and later  Pink [Taligent OS] by using emulators or, if necessary, the OSes themselves in  a 'shell' a.k. how SoftPC or OS/2 does DOS.}  Hardware  {In an effort to remove the 'reconfiguring the system almost every time you  add something' requirement for add-in cards, drivers, video, and operating  systems in the IBM world, Intel, Microsoft and 12 other hardware and software  developers are working out 'plug and play' standards (PC Week 03/08/93).} Color Support/Display  Mac: 30.24 MHz Pixel Clock standard.  All present Macs support the use of  32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw  allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y- bit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y  independently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63  dpi [12\\\" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including  autosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz  vertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser  Aug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and  IIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit  color (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).   To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display  capability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit  color.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX  will change this. In addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one  monitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same  thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree  of overlap of the pictures. VRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of   built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit  color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display.  Sound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became   standard with the SE/30.  IBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system  interacts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing  BIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation of clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program  interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer  Jawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a  standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is  actually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like  Mac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes,  especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present  things are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver  and monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS,  and monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with  an IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2  486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0  and still have ALL the colors one started out with}. Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster  processors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD  ROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).   MDA: Monocrome Display Adapter  original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text. CGA: Color Graphics Array  320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes. EGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array  640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions   could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes. VGA:  Video Graphics Array*  320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are   the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a   18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock  (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals  from EGA/CGA etc.  MCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array*  subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA   and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).    Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models. SVGA:  Super VGA*  This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch   all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer   using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating  as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a   standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things  are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution  of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since   1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600,   some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually   at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital   Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example],   some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting   factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were:   8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a   64K \\\"window\\\", etc. Other non-SVGA standards:  8514/a:  IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions   like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations   from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do   not have interlacing.  TMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some  do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD. XGA:  eXtended Graphics Array  newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones   are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at   1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes. XGA-2  Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in  Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area  fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co-  exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be   far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth   isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other   companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh   rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual   discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2. *some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.  Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.    Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the   end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software  drivers.  \\\"Fast SCSI-1\\\" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode  {see SCSI-2 for details}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast  SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in    hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are  4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and  15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can  use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such  is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called \\\"fast SCSI-1\\\".   16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics  but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a  different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which  makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}. Mac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though   Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager  needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI  interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast   asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2  controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1))   though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port   interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus   Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some  Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard   and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager. IBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with   systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.  Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers  out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications  which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.  Mac Memory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin   8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs  could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity   feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx   used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new   72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.  The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every  memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will  not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.  Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs   had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris   650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that   allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same   size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting   in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109). Printers, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard. Monitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs.  PDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE,   Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.    Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650:   4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with  the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in   IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows   through put down. NuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,  and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:  40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and   Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a   Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet   to DMA. NuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:  ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7\\\" instead of the   old 12\\\". QuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's   VLBus - \\\"Architecture is identical to that of VLBus\\\" (Byte 10/92:128).  Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development. CPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,    Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at   the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to   dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each   NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with   8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.  IBM Memory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac- like SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.  HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:  MFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited  only used with smaller [\\u00b2 60mb] hard drives. IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.  currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive.  ESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface  ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in  many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of  hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1.   BUS interfaces {New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working  with old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).} ISA  8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a  16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105).  1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,  hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards  aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.}  while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's  showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit  (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.   MCA {Micro Channel}  IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; \\\"allows use of more than one CPU in a computer\\\"   (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components   involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA   and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido). EISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}  32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to   self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable   interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use. VESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS}  Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit}  250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus   mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for   video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of  their patents (Mel Martinez). QuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture  (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines  (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development. PCI  Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace   ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development.  OSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.] and multiple application use.} Mac 512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows  Apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw,  menu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require  clone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires  access to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM  chips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support  interface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS  has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and  therefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control  over hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with  some of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a  totally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon  Wtte). 6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy,   cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.    Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program   interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of   AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a   24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as   real RAM is below 8MB. 6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers. 6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X. 7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard   to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present   non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on  system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking   within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing   can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be   accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X},   Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable   IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType   support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present   machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is   both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit   mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last   'free' OS. 7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than   7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode   on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension.   Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades  {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.  [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system   fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any   RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all   fonts from the system file.] A/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and   a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS   is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac   ROMs.  Price: $709. Note: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats  including the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and  DCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd'  and AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most  still play.  IBM  Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for  programmers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.   Since hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition,  what little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}   This results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or  EPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to  better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which  is harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it  reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware  support is needed. Side note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing  all feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing  its Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 (\\\"Undocumented Windows\\\") and  \\\"There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to  abort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present\\\" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92  #201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC  judicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no  action.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of  choosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has  turned down Microsoft's copyright of \\\"Windows\\\" which would allow it to charge  a fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93). MicroSoft OSes DOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier   with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program   must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS   Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit   Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in  DOS 4.0. DOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk   defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for   networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99}   (Byte April 1993:44-46). DOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93). Window 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to   deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to  run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the  equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface].  This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac  programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and  still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed  is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman).  Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS  counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108). Window 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base   requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx.   Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92). Windows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).    Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1   with built-in peer to peer networking support. Windows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the   swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in   the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the   reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM   but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92).  This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric   multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in  networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even  though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor  is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993  (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993  (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495  (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93). Other OSes PC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS   6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93). DR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression}   and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later   version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple   file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92). OS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM,  60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded,   multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file   to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}.   IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this   (InfoWorld Oct 26/92). AIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS. NeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.  Beta out, final   version to be out by May 25, 1993. Solaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric   multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with   tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and   communication package.  Client: $795,  50 users server: $1,995, 1000s users  server: $5,995.  Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195. Mac 7.1 [working name: Star Trek]:  Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel   Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM   (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run   on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps   will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to   Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow   progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in   late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.}  PowerPC Rumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92;  MacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA  video (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week  3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps. Apple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and  to have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to  sale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser  9/92:146)} (MacWeek 3/22/93). PowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on  PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain  (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard  drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993.  Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993. Pink [Taligent OS]: Expecting delivery in 1994 (Wall Street Journal 1/12/92)   and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and   PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93). Windows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details. Solaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the  Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state   that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for details NeXTStep: possible port see IBM OS section for details.  OS Number Crunching (Mel Park) Mac  Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard  Apple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an  FPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or  taking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are  handled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal  representation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment  of 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and  the FPU programmed directly.  IBM  Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when  emulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever  compiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers  exceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS  prompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this  better.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS,  Windows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.  Networking [Includes printing] WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially  if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer. Mac Hardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.   LocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for  each machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to  include very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in  Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at  about $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and  transceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet. The Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet  interface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a  network option since 1989. Software: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can  use variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS  as well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open,  Banyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing  machines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows  typical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version  will have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993  (MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC  Pathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software  built-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra.  Printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in  the chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the  chooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers. Printing bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.  {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}  IBM   Hardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing. Software: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk  protocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}. Each of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible  with the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to  that product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more  forgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest,  {~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and  offers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more  complex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac  finder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;   InfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93) Printing {Very OS dependent} DOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port,   and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written   software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly   implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one   software program to the next. Windows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing \\\"jobs\\\"   in the print queue, but it always lists printers as \\\"active\\\"... even if they   are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers   on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine   which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like   and intelligent about this. OS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS. Printing bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do  not have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and  not that of the OS involved.  Price issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features  than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars  by both worlds. The IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware  standarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to  handle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac  hardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,   built-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and  NuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent  equipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs  which cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.  Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993. All Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.  Except where  noted, monitor is extra and a built-in monitor interface is provided {no card  needed except for 24-bit color display}. IBM planned a $1,200 386SLC/25MHz model with a 60MB hard drive and color VGA  monitor {~VRAM} (MacWeek 8/17/92) {sounds like a Color Classic without SCSI-1,  sound support, built-in network support, FPU socket, built-in expansion to  16-bit color, etc}. Color Classic:  $1,389 - 030/16MHz with 16-bit data bus {~386sx/20MHz  equivalent}, 4/80, FPU socket, and built-in monitor. LCIII: $1,499 - 030/25MHz {~386dx/33MHz equivalent}, and 4/160. Centris 610: $2,899 - 68LC040/20MHz {Depending on the program ~486sx/40 or  ~'486dx2sx'/20[40]MHz equivalent}, 8/230, built-in ethernet, 300i CD-ROM, a  PDS/NuBus 90 slot and VRAM for 16-bit color. Centris 650: 040/25MHz {Depending on the program ~486dx/50 MHz or 486dx2/50  MHz equivalent} with a PDS and 3 NuBus 90 slots. $3,189 {ethernet, 8/80};  $3,559 {ethernet, 8/230}; $3,999 {ethernet, 8/230, CD-ROM, VRAM for 16-bit  color}  Bibliography notes 'Vaporware' is available in the digest/vapor directory by FTP on sumex- aim.stanford.edu [36.44.0.6] and was by Murphy Sewall {last issue: April 93.} 'Info-IBMPC Digest' back issues are available from wsmr-simtel20.army.mil in  directory PD2:<ARCHIVES.IBMPC> 'Dictionary of Computer Terms 3rd ed.'

As ``domicile'' and ``residence'' are usually in the same place, they are frequently used as if they had the same meaning, but they are not identical terms, for a person may have two places of residence, as in the city and country, but only one domicile.  Residence means living in a particular locality, but domicile means living in that locality with intent to make it a fixed and permanent home.  Residence simply requires bodily presence as an inhabitant in a given place, while domicile requires bodily presence in that place and also an intention to make it one's domicile.  In re Riley's Will, 266 N.Y.S. 209, 148 Misc. 588.  ``Residence'' demands less intimate local ties than ``domicile,'' but ``domicile'' allows absence for indefinite period if intent to return remains.

(Sorry for length).  To increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed from 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively. This is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some aluminum foil down to work on.  1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case.  2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables,   spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out.  3. Remove the flopy drive.  4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting   the supply straight up and out.  5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom   side of the fan and lifting straight up and out.  6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and   right side of the board and sliding the board forward then   lifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the   board must be removed first)  7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules).   This is not easy even for a skilled solderer.  8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins   by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.  9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder    them in.  10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.  11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and    the other large chip just to the right of the processor and   figure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made a   simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole   in the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using   insulated washers.

Some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they  were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for \\\"numbers\\\" (though  secretly afraid of them). Others steered clear of such puzzle books because  they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern  mathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't  know how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were  no exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a  specialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \\\"I willingly confess that  any time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was a hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of  my friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route --constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid  using algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it's a fact that is  well known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates,  nor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers (nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It  seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade  teachers.\\\"  Now, I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the  bookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to  recommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most  fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a  relatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to Venus and back.     One for the \\\"road\\\"   They both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley   glanced at the Royal Astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with   a group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. \\\"God   knows what this kind of stuff leads to,\\\" thought Kingsley.   The Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley's book and saw the History   of Herodotus. \\\"Good Lord, next he'll be reading Thucydides,\\\" thought   the Royal Astronomer.      --Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud  The book I'm talking about isn't very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24  elegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same time, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these  problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian  architecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is  now Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant  letters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of  Komitas, or the paintings of Saryan.  An edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a  bibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions of Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh  Century (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).  The abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way  of life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and  worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years  the book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in  Armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just anyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk  Father Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has  brought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the  general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable  problem book.    Vardapet Anania of Shirak   Once fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no   philosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering   it the mother of all wisdom.      --Anania of Shirak  Among ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because  of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his  work. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and Solutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation of scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and Armenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last work was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia,  Movses of Khoren).  In his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:   I, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our  Armenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately,   in the expression of the psalmist, \\\"every day I illuminated the   eyes of my mind.\\\" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,  I came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy,   the mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia   neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the   sciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man   named Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me  that in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,  Christosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But          soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but          only of certain fragmentary facts.   I then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me:   \\\"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the   coast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full   of wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature.\\\" I asked   them how they knew this. They answered: \\\"We saw ourselves that many   people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man.   Indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,  Philagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become   pupils of Tyukhik.\\\" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to   God, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.   I went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I   He sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St.   Gregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself   lived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there.\\\"   Vardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with   me. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated   the science of number, and with such success that my fellow students  at the king's court began to envy me.   I spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not   been translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable   collection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan,   books on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why   enumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did   not have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating  that when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into   Armenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the   translation read as if the work were written in that language   originally.   Tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had   learned the Armenian language. \\\"When I was young,\\\" he said, \\\"I lived   in Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and   for a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I   served as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and   literature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was   wounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to   the Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: \\\"If You prolong my life,   I shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to   collecting treasures of knowledge.\\\" And the Lord heard my prayers.   After I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria   and Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher   from Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned   to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\\\"   After some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for   him, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to   assume the teacher's position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to   God not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because  of his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study   with him.   And I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from   him this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our   country, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God's   help, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me   for my efforts.      Problems and Solutions   A half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed  on verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper;   one forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and   forty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many   copies were printed in all.      --Imitation of Anania of Shirak  A Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\\\"books have their own fate\\\"). The fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The manuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because, according to  Armenian historians, \\\"in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded  from invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children.\\\" Biding their time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of  ancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts). And its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two  manuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction  and commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited,  annotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a  member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).  In the translator's words, the problems of Anania are \\\"amusing, full of life,  and simple.\\\" Orbeli goes on to say: \\\"The subjects of the problems are  generally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland  Shirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are  named, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a  contemporary of Anania.\\\" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used  only \\\"aliquots\\\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is necessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to  represent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).  Like any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the  retelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their  full glory. So let's open Anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages.  Problems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D.  572.  Problem 1  My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the  Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary  heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops.  The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time,  pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third  time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were  still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from  this remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.  Problem 8  During the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak Kamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the Persian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a  day. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent  riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in  a day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.  Problem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian  translation, they are all called \\\"dishes.\\\" But in the original Armenian,  according to Orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are  called mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian  word, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before  Anania's Problems and Solutions.  Problem 18  There was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the  metal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from one fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten  drams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.  Several of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in  Anania's time -- for instance, problem 7.  Problem 7  Once I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank  of the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast.  We caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped out of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found  forty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.  The temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I'll restrain myself and offer you just one more.  Problem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that  inhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no mention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according  to the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of  Shirak offers evidence to the contrary .  Problem 20  The hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik,  was at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild donkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and,  running to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with his brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild  beasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by  arrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were  caught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And  so, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.    \\\"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli\\\"   His biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a   bibliography.     -- K Uzbashyan, Academician      Iosef Abgarovich Orbeli  Anyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the  solution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation  of Anania of Shirak's Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages, has probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders,  and the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great  attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for  a degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma  attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An  advertisement at the end of the book reads: \\\"This book was typeset in  December 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by  me, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with  borders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project  to the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.\\\"  Typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned  orientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage  Museum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had  already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis  Academiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its  rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish  the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian  churches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve  the unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G. Strolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the  blockade of Leningrad in World War II.)  When Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times  were hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania was for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the  printer's craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the  Academy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion of Russian academic typography.     Back to Earth   This book by definition does not exhaust all the most important   works in this domain. The editor hopes that those who are guilty   of this incompleteness will read these lines and, stung by shame,   will work up, if not a collection like this, at least a monograph.     --V.

Maybe one of the space travelers will take  this very copy of Quantum, and another, looking over her shoulder, will read  this article and say to himself: \\\"This Anania from Shirak seems like a pretty  interesting guy. When I get home I'll try to find his problems.\\\"  Good luck, my young friend! Anania is sure to entertain you. Perhaps by then there will be more than n copies of his timeless Problems and Solutions. And  we can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by  Iosef Orbeli.

Features:     Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.    No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).    Generic clients.    Customizable servers.    Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).    Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).    Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily         attached.  Functionality:    Client:    The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things    when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's    viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's    actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to    other users.     The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to    develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that    resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting    it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.     This release of the client software supports the following functionality:      o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)      o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)      o User Interface Panels      o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for  faster frame rates)      o Mouse and Keyboard Input     (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the    PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because    I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)    Server(s):    This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is    provided in this release for potential world server developers:      o Transparent Client Management      o Client Message Handling     This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of accepting and    terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer    can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.     Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is    what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:      o Server Selectable Extension Installation:         What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended         functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension         initialisers you want.      o Event Handler Registration:         When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback         functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.         (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)      o Collision Detection Registration:         If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide         some basic information to the collision detection management software.         Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.      This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because     the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects     from which to choose.      The following is all you need to make a World Server application:      o Provide an initWorld function:         This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus         any initialization you want to do.      o Provide a positionObject function:         This is where you determine where to place a new client.      o Provide an installWorldObjects function:         This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.      o Provide a getWorldType function:         This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.      o Provide an animateWorld function:         This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects         move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit         (to avoid outrunning the clients).      That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the     three world servers I've provided:          generic - 81 lines         dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the                            stairs! Will probably be improved with future                            versions)         dogfight - 72 lines  Location:     This software is located at the following site:    ftp.u.washington.edu     Directory:    pub/virtual-worlds     File:    multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z  Futures:     Client:      o Texture mapping.      o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading      o HMD support.      o Etc, etc....

I've been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties with Christianity. It is surprising to note that a large majority of people, at least in Finland, seem to be apatheists - even though 90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland, religious people are actually a minority.   Could it be possible that many people believe in god \\\"just in case\\\"? It seems people do not want to seek the truth; they fall prey to Pascal's Wager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believe reads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn't care - it believes, but doesn't know what or how.   People don't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle, they only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say that they are not \\\"born in the Spirit\\\", but this does not disturb them. Religion is not something to think about.   I'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless -  a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to. Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop, too many people take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow (and unconsciously hope god wouldn't notice ;-) )  : Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a : higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The : typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the : same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the : other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn : somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core, : than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it : expresses its own selfishness.  If logic and reason are valued, then I would claim that atheistic thinking is of higher value than the theistic exposition. Theists make unnecessary assumptions they believe in - I've yet to see good reasons to believe in gods, or to take a leap of faith at all. A revelation would do.  However, why do we value logic and reasoning? This questions bears some resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science: why mathematics works? Strong deep structuralists, like Atkins, have proposed that perhaps, after all, everything _is_ mathematics.   Is usefulness any criterion?  Petri \",\"The FLYERS blew a 3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period, but Kevin Dineen's 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win, 7-4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row. Alexander Mogilny led the comeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at 3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots on goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and LaFontaine all night.  Roster move:  Andre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy scratch.  Lines:  Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-McGill  Tommy Soderstrom  Game Summary:  Say, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that woman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!  The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have been shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the first period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday when they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that he was getting bored back there...  Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After Buffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead to Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed the puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and in on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the right past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and Garry should turn down their assists :-).  The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong and kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive struggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when Terry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into the boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not a terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got a post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.  Keith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to give the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league didn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a good scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards the end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept missing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give the Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots were 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.  Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered a rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the season went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was Russ Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed Snider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd do it all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the end of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup. He expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title the following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.  He's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \\\"outstanding\\\"). Happy with the current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable. Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a consensus.  The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May took a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble getting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres blue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling through the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.  Then Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line and went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was all over it.  The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them. Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when Barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer took a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln't get started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the FLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and headed the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to make it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John Muckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.  But the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to just get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all over them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through Soderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it. Mistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and mistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn't even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks end for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.  Lindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking minor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get set up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued to keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended. Things evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill allowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a faceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of him. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and that meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major, 7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.  The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long they could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to Ledyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by Soderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had moved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net at 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to put it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.  The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek was strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the neutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS blue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the left circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at 18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between the 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off angles...  That was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.  Into the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the FLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in the slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he hit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.  Than an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood untouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under Soderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on, horn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange reason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...  Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS could not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through, but were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck from a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass, but twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.  But the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate out, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew in, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at 5:24 to tie the game at 4.  Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up in the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in the middle. While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44.  Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19. The FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind'Amour and Ledyard went after it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated to the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing through the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season for Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th of the season.  Then Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres power play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the chances on the FLYERS resulting power play.  Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big saves. The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running  out as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres. Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found Dineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the right of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton chipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48 on his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo, and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the game.  So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much in his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night (unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so). The FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against with three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals despite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place since the Rangers lose the tie breaker.  A couple misc notes:  Forget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.  In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award, but I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.  The Times of Trenton has reported that \\\"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\\\" has looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near future.  Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he expected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back, he feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a role scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.

PHILIP K. DICK  Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short  stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable. He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:  \\\"Galactic Pot-Healer\\\" A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.  \\\"A Maze of Death\\\" Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.  \\\"VALIS\\\" The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.  \\\"The Divine Invasion\\\" God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.  MARGARET ATWOOD  \\\"The Handmaid's Tale\\\" A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it \\\"right\\\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked, and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \\\"old world\\\" are hunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.  VARIOUS AUTHORS  \\\"The Bible\\\" This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it is probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is about.

Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France and Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England developments.  \\\"Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism, Without God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate of a single idea, the belief that God exists.\\\"  316 pages.

Includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many people.  For some popular observations, traces the way in which various people expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries.  Quite a number of the quotations are derived from Cardiff's \\\"What Great Men Think of Religion\\\" and Noyes' \\\"Views of Religion\\\". 490 pages. ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X.  RICHARD SWINBURNE  \\\"The Existence of God (Revised Edition)\\\", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with \\\"The Coherence of Theism\\\" (1977) and was concluded with \\\"Faith and Reason\\\" (1981).  In this work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were decisively rejected in Mackie's \\\"The Miracle of Theism\\\".  In the revised edition of \\\"The Existence of God\\\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.  J. L. MACKIE  \\\"The Miracle of Theism\\\", Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational, such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \\\"replacements for God\\\" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.  JAMES A.

Merely pointing out that Ted's assertion that the \\\"blip\\\" in revenues was \\\"caused\\\" by selling to avoid the tax can't be proven.    Not disputed.    It works for any situation.  If you believe the market is going up, don't sell.   If believe it's not, sell.  But then you'd be selling anyways, wouldn't you?   So where is the evidence that a large number of people suddenly decided that the higher taxes meant they should sell before the year was out?   There isn't any.   Ted's saying that the increase over the previous year is \\\"proof\\\" of that proposition, but I'm saying you can't know that the trend of increasing capital gains revenues wouldn't account for a lot of that increase.  1986 was the height of the housing boom, remember.

My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside the point. What does the Roman Catholic church say?

The sad truth is: sometimes that is good, or at least, better than the alternative.   Ok.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the number has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these accidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.  ...  In fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that.  The idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber handgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense, would, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't why I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it, and might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to kill people.   In fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses of firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer not to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what you say when you point a gun at them.  If you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to immediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work the best.[3]   Certainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing) aren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of them were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with having deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to use deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right, but my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and knowing how to use the tools to do that.  \\\"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\\\"  - T. Jefferson.  I think what Jefferson said is still true.   Not very often compared to other use.[3]   This isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is very rare that a non-violent person will suddenly \\\"get-pissed\\\" and kill someone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long histories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these people wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it.   Right, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I never have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from rodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than is necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them to drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that, I don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and ammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm after, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point, people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns, particularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.

In 1932, the accidental deaths by firearm per  1,000,000 people was 24.03. In 1987, it was 5.74. The decline has been  steady, consistent, and a fairly straight line when plotted. At the rate  of the last sixty years, it will reach zero sometime around 2025 AD.  CONCLUSION ========== Firearms have been a declining factor in accidental deaths for over  sixty years, despite rising per-capita gun ownership.    [1] = Year. [2] = Population. [3] = Accidental deaths. [4] = Accidental deaths per 1,000,000.

Anyway, turning the thread around, the other day I played tennis during my lunch hour.  I'm out of tennis shape so it was very intense exercise.  I got overheated, and dehydrated.  Afterwards, I noticed a tingling sensation all over my head then about 2 hours later, I could feel a migraine start.  (I continued to drink water in the afternoon.) I took cafergot, but it didn't help and the pain started although it wasn't as intense as it usually is and about 9pm that night, the pain subsided.  This isn't the first time that I've had a migraine occur after exercise. I'm wondering if anyone else has had the same experience and I wonder what triggers the migraine in this situation (heat buildup? dehydration?).

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.  Later'ish Craig \",\" I agree with what Darren has to say here, but would like to add a  personal observation.  What I see as arrogance and the problem I have  with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just  Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by objective means.    Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal  sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these  matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them  but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus  anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God. Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud notion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that leads to arrogance.

For instance, 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering' might be thought of as a plausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the contention remains true, just as '5 + 7 = 12' remains correct even if there is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor can they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding content;  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true in virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to action (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may talk of 'self-evident truths', but can he deny the subjectivist's claim that self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?

Being brought up in a Christian household, I often wondered if there was God the Father, where was the mother? Everyone I know who has a father usually as a mother. It just seemed rather unbalanced to me.   Fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not fall into line with a lot others, recognized God as a being both without gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both a masculine and feminine force. It provides a sense of balance I find sorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which I think is responsible for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat each other.\",\"I have an 8514/A card, and I am using windows in 1024x768 mode   (normal 8514/A font, not small).

Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that goaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're Montreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it; he literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides, Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.  Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more).  Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than  five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME  ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear  the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to  play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.  Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this article, if possible.   I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who) in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in regardless.   Yep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second, IMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.  Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their zone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red  Army.    But I still hate the team.  On the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a powerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit.  Same goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is waving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.  New Jersey was overmatched, Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.  Mario is unbelievable, and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.

Automatic setups are fine for simple, repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more complex events where you need to understand how the scope is actually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope in \\\"equivalent time\\\" or in \\\"real time\\\" sampling mode (equivalent time being a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to the trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling rate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but before display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.  Is the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz sample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front end including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for equivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really only helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single sample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.  So, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get useful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for general use and the digital for events where I need storage for later analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability of the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to fall...  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin   Phone: (205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking    (205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

The biggest eg I can think of is to get a  metal sensing sat over a paying country and scan their territory for  precious metals.  More importantly, if radar can spot water vapour (clouds), presumably a radar based sat will be capable of spotting rivers,open water and  *underground water* from space. This would be a positive life saver for African or other drought affected countries. Implementing a clean water and irrigation program would be of imense benifit to such countries and should cut down mortalities considerably.  So how about it?

Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays 6-3 opening victory.  But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick Knickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.  Knickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was  yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.  Yet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup again and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic Saddledome popcorn.  \\\"If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I dropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\\\"  Stauber wondered.  \\\"Not that I'd be happy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the playoffs.\\\"  Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not convinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.  While insisting he is the Kings' \\\"goalie of the future,\\\" Melrose said Stauber flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were, according to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New York Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to  Vancouver on Thursday.  \\\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could have taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it,\\\" Melrose said.  \\\"An elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a great goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup.\\\"  \\\"I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you've got to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everything is on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect more from him than he does.\\\"  Ouch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the team hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed off the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.  \\\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\\\" said Stauber, a three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only  to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.  \\\"What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated disk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do expect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here.\\\"  \\\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry  doesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'm a perfectionist.\\\"  Stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \\\"But  even though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's  a bit of a jump,\\\" he said.  \\\"You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game  you're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67  and then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain  to him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I  do know is, it's a sport.  I'll be there.\\\"  Melrose's \\\"goalie of the future\\\" statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. \\\"Before you know it, I'll be 30 and there will be no future,\\\" he said.  ------  *Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC  Channel 7 here in LA.

The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots  of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now  defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.  The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the  SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they  were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.  About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once  in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as  Christ.  Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young  adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over  the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.  They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of  weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US  government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were  putting themselves in a self defense position.    In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn' t have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.

A product cipher is a block cipher that iterates several weak   operations such as substitution, transposition, modular   addition/multiplication, and linear transformation. (A ``block   cipher'' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data---8 bytes,   say---all at once, then goes on to the next block.) The notion of   product ciphers is due to Shannon [SHA49]. Examples of modern   product ciphers include LUCIFER [SOR84], DES [NBS77], SP-networks   [KAM78], LOKI [BRO90], FEAL [SHI84], PES [LAI90], Khufu and Khafre   [ME91a]. The so-called Feistel ciphers are a class of product   ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round,   and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round. LUCIFER,   DES, LOKI, and FEAL are examples of Feistel ciphers.    The following table compares the main parameters of several product    ciphers:    cipher   |   block length   |   key bits   |   number of rounds   LUCIFER          128               128                16   DES               64                56                16   LOKI              64                64                16   FEAL              64               128            2^x, x >= 5   PES               64               128                 8  * What makes a product cipher secure?    Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is   completely secure. So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the   cipher ``looks highly random''. For example, the cipher must be   nonlinear, and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends   on every bit of the plaintext and the key. Meyer [MEY78] has shown   that at least 5 rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a   dependence. In this sense a product cipher should act as a ``mixing''   function which combines the plaintext, key, and ciphertext in a   complex nonlinear fashion.    The fixed per-round substitutions of the product cipher are   referred to as S-boxes. For example, LUCIFER has 2 S-boxes, and DES   has 8 S-boxes. The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a   careful design of these S-boxes. A list of partial design criteria   for the S-boxes of DES, which apply to S-boxes in general, may be   found in Brown [BRO89] and Brickell et al. [BRI86].  * What are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers?    Let E be a product cipher that maps N-bit blocks to N-bit blocks.   Let E_K(X) be the encryption of X under key K. Then, for any fixed K,   the map sending X to E_K(X) is a permutation of the set of N-bit   blocks. Denote this permutation by P_K. The set of all N-bit   permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S_{2^N}.   The collection of all these permutations P_K, where K ranges over all   possible keys, is denoted E(S_{2^N}). If E were a random mapping from   plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect E(S_{2^N}) to generate   a large subset of S_{2^N}.    Coppersmith and Grossman [COP74] have shown that a very simple   product cipher can generate the alternating group A_{2^N} given a   sufficient number of rounds. (The alternating group is half of the   symmetric group: it consists of all ``even'' permutations, i.e., all   permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps.)   Even and Goldreich [EVE83] were able to extend these results to show   that Feistel ciphers can generate A_{2^N}, given a sufficient number   of rounds.    The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the   group-theoretic properties of a cipher. Multiple encipherment is an   extension over single encipherment if for keys K1, K2 there does   not exist a third key K3 such that    E_K2(E_K1(X)) == E_(K3)(X)                (**)    which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys   K1, K2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key K3.  If   for every K1, K2 there exists a K3 such that eq. (**) is true then   we say that E is a group.    This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was   extensively studied by Sherman, Kaliski, and Rivest [SHE88]. In their   paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a   group. In fact DES is not a group [CAM93].  * What can be proven about the security of a product cipher?    Recall from above that P_K is a permutation produced by E under   some key K. The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that P_K   appears to be a random element of S_{2^N}, the symmetric group.   Let R be an element of S_{2^N} selected randomly. We will say that P_K   and R are indistinguishable if an observer given P_K and R in some   order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial   time. That is, with time bounded resources, the observer cannot   determine which of the permutations is produced by E: the optimal   decision is no better than simply guessing.    Luby and Rackoff [LUB88] have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers   are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by   random boolean functions.  * How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size?    There are four standard \\\"modes of operation\\\" (and numerous non-standard   ones as well).  The standard modes of operation are defined in the U.S.   Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 81,   published in 1980.  See the question about \\\"ECB\\\" below for more details.    Although they are defined for the DES block cipher, the \\\"modes of   operation\\\" can be used with any block cipher.  * Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication?    One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself   that he did or did not generate a message, and to prove to himself    whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation.  But one   cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key, and    thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages   that were authenticated using that key.      See ANSI X3.106-1983 and FIPS 113 (1985) for a standard method of message   authentication using DES.  * What exactly is DES?    DES is the U.S. Government's Data Encryption Standard - a product    cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data, using a 56-bit key.      It is defined in FIPS 46-1 (1988) [which supersedes FIPS 46 (1977)].   FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS.   DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA)   defined in ANSI X3.92-1981.   * What is triple DES?    Triple DES is a product cipher which, like DES, operates on 64-bit    data blocks.  There are several forms, each of which uses the DES   cipher 3 times.  Some forms use two 56-bit keys, some use three.   The \\\"DES modes of operation\\\" may also be used with triple-DES.    Some people refer to E(K1,D(K2,E(K1,x))) as triple-DES.    This method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985   \\\"Financial Institution Key Management\\\" and is intended for use in   encrypting DES keys and IVs for \\\"Automated Key Distribution\\\".  Its   formal name is \\\"Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key   Pair\\\", but it is referenced in other standards documents as EDE.    That standard says (section 7.2.1): \\\"Key encrypting keys may be a single   DEA key or a DEA key pair.  Key pairs shoud be used where additional   security is needed (e.g., the data protected by the key(s) has a long   security life).  A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a   single key.\\\"    Others use the term \\\"triple-DES\\\" for E(K1,D(K2,E(K3,x))) or   E(K1,E(K2,E(K3,x))).    One of us (Carl Ellison) keeps advocating DES triple use in the form   E(K1, TRAN( E(K2, TRAN( E(K3, COMPRESS( x )))))), where each DES instance   has its own key and IV (for CBC mode) and TRAN has been posted on   sci.crypt.  (It is a large-block transposition program taking its key   from the data stream itself, so that it is not an encryption program on   its own part.)  * What is differential cryptanalysis?    Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be   applied to any iterated mapping (ie. any mapping which is based on   a repeated round function). The method was recently popularized by   Biham and Shamir [BIH91], but Coppersmith has remarked that the   S-boxes of DES were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago.   This method has proved effective against several product ciphers,   notably FEAL [BI91a].    Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of   ciphertexts Y, Y' whose corresponding plaintexts X, X' satisfy a   known difference D = X+X', where + is componentwise XOR. In the   basic Biham-Shamir attack, 2^{47} such plaintext pairs are required   to determine the key for DES. Substantially fewer pairs are required   if DES is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds. In these cases, the actual key   can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs.   For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many   known plaintexts.    The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling   observations on the algorithm. Most importantly, if the key   schedule was removed from DES and a 16*48 = 768-bit key was used,   the key could be recovered in less than 2^{64} steps. Thus   independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES.   Further, the S-boxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that   changing even single entries in these tables yields significant   improvement in the differential attack.    Adi Shamir is quoted to say (NYTimes Oct 13 1991), ``I would say   that, contrary to what some people believe, there is no evidence   of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened.''  * How was NSA involved in the design of DES?    According to Kinnucan [KIN78], Tuchman, a member of the group that   developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying, ``We developed the DES   algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not   dictate a single wire!'' Tuchman and Meyer (another developer of   DES) spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in   Lucifer. They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer. ``Their   basic approach was to look for strong substitution, permutation,   and key scheduling functions ... IBM has classified the notes   containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA....   `The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep   secrets it uses to make its own algorithms,' explains Tuchman.''      On the other hand, a document called ``Involvement of the NSA in   the development of DES: unclassified summary of the United States   Select Committee on Intelligence'', printed in the IEEE   Communications Magazine, p53-55, 1978, states: ``In the development   of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient;   indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and   certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their   knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.''    Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA.   The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the   algorithm itself, just the parameters, which in some sense   resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman   presented above.  * Is DES available in software?    Several people have made DES code available via ftp (see part 10 for   pathnames): Stig Ostholm [FTPSO]; BSD [FTPBK]; Eric Young [FTPEY];   Dennis Furguson [FTPDF]; Mark Riordan [FTPMR]; Phil Karn [FTPPK].   A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson [PAT87].    FIPS 46-1 says \\\"The algorithm specified in this standard is to be   implemented ... using hardware (not software) technology.  ...   Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in   compliance with this standard.\\\"  Despite this, software   implementations abound, and are used by government agencies.  * Is DES available in hardware?

These are methods for using block ciphers, such as DES, to encrypt    messages, files, and blocks of data, known as \\\"modes of operation.\\\"   Four \\\"modes of operation\\\" are defined in FIPS 81 (1980 December 2),    and also in ANSI X3.106-1983.       FIPS 81 specifies that when 7-bit ASCII data is sent in octets, the   unused most-significant bit is to be set to 1.   FIPS 81 also specifies the padding for short blocks.    The four DES modes of operation are:   Electronic Code Book  (ECB),   Cipher Block Chaining (CBC),   K-bit Cipher FeedBack (CFB), and   K-bit Output FeedBack (OFB).    These methods are explained below in a c-language-like notation.    Some symbols:    P[n] The n'th block of plaintext, input to encryption, output from    decryption.  Size of block determined by the mode.    C[n] The n'th block of ciphertext, output from encryption, input to    decryption.  Size of block determined by the mode.    E(m) The DES encryption function, performed on 64-bit block m, using    the 16-key schedule derived from some 56-bit key.    D(m) The DES decryption function, performed on 64-bit block m, using    the same key schedule as in E(m), except that the 16 keys    in the schedule are used in the opposite order as in E(m).    IV A 64-bit \\\"initialization vector\\\", a secret value which, along with    the key, is shared by both encryptor and decryptor.    I[n] The n'th value of a 64-bit variable, used in some modes.   R[n] The n'th value of a 64-bit variable, used in some modes.    LSB(m,k) The k least significant (right-most) bits of m.    e.g.  m & ((1 << k) - 1)    MSB(m,k) The k most significant (left-most) bits of m.    e.g.  (m >> (64-k)) & ((1 << k) - 1)    = ^ << >> &  operators as defined in the c langage.     Electronic Code Book (ECB):       P[n] and C[n] are each 64-bits long.       Encryption:   Decryption:      C[n] = E(P[n])  P[n] = D(C[n])     Cipher Block Chaining (CBC):       P[n] and C[n] are each 64-bits long.

Encryption:   Decryption:      I[0] = IV   I[0] = IV   (n>0)   I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | C[n-1] I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | C[n-1]    (all n) R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)  R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)   (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]  P[n] = C[n]^R[n]       Note that for k==64, this reduces to:       I[0] = IV   I[0] = IV   (n>0)   I[n] = C[n-1]   I[n] = C[n-1]    (all n) R[n] = E(I[n])  R[n] = E(I[n])   (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]  P[n] = C[n]^R[n]    CFB notes: Since I[n] depends only on the plain or cipher text from the   previous operation, the E() function can be performed in parallel with   the reception of the text with which it is used.     k-bit Output FeedBack (OFB):       P[n] and C[n] are each k bits long, 1 <= k <= 64.         Encryption:   Decryption:      I[0] = IV   I[0] = IV   (n>0)   I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | R[n-1] I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | R[n-1]    (all n) R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)  R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)   (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]  P[n] = C[n]^R[n]       Note that for k==64, this reduces to:       I[0] = IV   I[0] = IV   (n>0)   I[n] = R[n-1]   I[n] = R[n-1]    (all n) R[n] = E(I[n])  R[n] = E(I[n])   (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]  P[n] = C[n]^R[n]    OFB notes: encryption and decryption are identical.  Since I[n] is   independent of P and C, the E() function can be performed in advance of   the receipt of the plain/cipher text with which it is to be used.

(or 1/60th of a second for an image composed of only odd or even scan lines)\",\"Michael Bushnell writes;   Which is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your use of the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it said the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that has changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the Nicene - Constantinopolitan did not.  Of course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene Creed (it wasn't there to begin with), but they certainly did from the Athanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.  I might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in ways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East emphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father through the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the Son.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see below)   \\\"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do call God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the root and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the river are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms, but coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must necessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on that account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there are two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is third from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit of the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river, and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray.\\\"  -Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)  and   \\\"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father through the Son\\\"  -Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)  And as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36, Articles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of generation, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession emphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in a more preeminent way.   \\\"For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it from the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the Father alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called unbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of theologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a matter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives to the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit proceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of the Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound mind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each, however, but proceeds from each and both.\\\"  -St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)  So, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at least), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but in proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the procession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the Father through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father, the Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any mention of the Son being necessary.  In any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope St. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St. Damsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose of Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the Fathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic position, which I enunciated above.  As for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I will point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke of the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone \\\"to produce, write, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by the Fathers of Nicea.\\\"  That Creed is a different Creed than that of Constantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of course in that they were condemning the adoption of the Constantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of Nicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious, who had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the Church, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy Spirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan Creed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council Chalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been against explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves approved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations of the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work done by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows that the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed by the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians in Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until many years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was not disputed, I provide more quotes below.   \\\"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to God, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly clear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding from it.\\\"  -St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial Trinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)   \\\"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he is the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone loves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him'; and again it is written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the Holy Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel, that the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,' and that `He shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you.'\\\"  -Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)   \\\"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the appelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to the Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the Father,' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,' and `will receive of mine,' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the Son, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit divine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of the Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like soul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father and of the Son, a third by appelation....  \\\"The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit breathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor is the Spirit created.\\\"  -St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored, 8 and 75 (374 AD)   \\\"Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is it necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him, it is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary to speak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and the Son, His Sources.\\\"  -St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)   Thus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt, Palastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time, all have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine expressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church that they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus who all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is not enough to bring up the \\\"proceeds from the Father\\\" line of the Creed or the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.  But it does not say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son, only that He does proceed from the Father.\",\"Dbase IV, ver 1.5, 3.5 disks.

The signal is only to be sent over a few hundred  meters. It seems to me that the frequency intended for this use is about 150MHz and about 440MHz. To make the transmitters as light as possible I suppose it will be best  the to send the signals in an analog form. As this application is rather  specialized I do not expect to be able to buy the exact transmitter- units i need. On the other hand I imagine that I can buy the receiver somewhere. I  need a multichannel (up to 30 channels) receiver or 30 complete   receivers in some rack system where one can add as many receivers  as needed in the particular case. DO ANYBODY KNOW IF THERE IS EXISTING SUCH RECEIVER  SYSTEM ON THE MARKET?\",\" May I suggest you chech out the _Palestinian National Covenant (1964)_.  It may not use the exact words as quoted above but I'm sure many will agree that the same message is being issued.  Later on when I get back home I will try to find the precise section(s) but you can do the research for now (I hope).  I also realize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_ *to the Western media only* but he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact intentions on this issue.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_ still stands as the \\\"Bible\\\" (so to speak) of the mainstream Palestinian National movement!    As a staunch pro-Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT influenced my opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As I mentioned above, just a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar conclusion on the Palestinian National movement (the PLO in most cases).  BB does not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share my views.   What 1948 situation?  A negative situation I presume?  Is this the same \\\"situation\\\" when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the Jews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM?  Was this an example of Qu'ranic law being exercised?  If not, I have another suggested reading for you... get into the \\\"soc.culture.arabic\\\" newsgroup where the posters have been debating the topic \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" (and may I remind you the people doing the debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran). You will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran (to put it lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will be treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran?  I think the 1948-1967 \\\"situation\\\" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you think?   All I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" and think again.  \\\"Freedom of choice\\\" is *definitely* not an option in Qu'ranic law especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I'm sure you saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic state).   Probably nothing!  Aside from how to break the news to his Palestinian brethren that the _Covenant_ is \\\"null and void\\\" without getting assassinated himself!   In conclusion, Ahmed, you should go to the library and find the _Palestinian National Covenant (1964)_ and read it VERY CAREFULLY.  By the way, Redpath Library DOES have it in stock because that is exactly where I found it when I was doing my research.  So enjoy the reading and I hope we will be hearing back from you soon!  - Mike  ---        MI     KE   MIK    EMIK   EMI  K        \\\"Opinions expressed above        M I   K E  M   I  K        E   M         are my own and not that        M  I K  E  MIKEM  I  KEM   I   K         of 'Big Blue'\\\"        M   I   K  E   M   IKE M  IKE  MIKE\"]},\"selected\":{\"id\":\"1105\"},\"selection_policy\":{\"id\":\"1104\"}},\"id\":\"1065\",\"type\":\"ColumnDataSource\"},{\"attributes\":{\"fill_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"fill_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"hatch_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"hatch_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"line_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"size\":{\"field\":\"size\"},\"x\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_0\"},\"y\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_1\"}},\"id\":\"1088\",\"type\":\"Circle\"},{\"attributes\":{\"source\":{\"id\":\"1065\"}},\"id\":\"1084\",\"type\":\"CDSView\"},{\"attributes\":{\"coordinates\":null,\"formatter\":{\"id\":\"1099\"},\"group\":null,\"major_label_policy\":{\"id\":\"1100\"},\"ticker\":{\"id\":\"1047\"}},\"id\":\"1046\",\"type\":\"LinearAxis\"},{\"attributes\":{\"axis\":{\"id\":\"1042\"},\"coordinates\":null,\"group\":null,\"ticker\":null},\"id\":\"1045\",\"type\":\"Grid\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"id\":\"1043\",\"type\":\"BasicTicker\"},{\"attributes\":{\"fill_alpha\":{\"value\":0.1},\"fill_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"hatch_alpha\":{\"value\":0.1},\"hatch_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"value\":0.1},\"line_color\":{\"field\":\"__COLOR__\"},\"size\":{\"field\":\"size\"},\"x\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_0\"},\"y\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_1\"}},\"id\":\"1093\",\"type\":\"Circle\"},{\"attributes\":{\"overlay\":{\"id\":\"1056\"}},\"id\":\"1054\",\"type\":\"LassoSelectTool\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"id\":\"1103\",\"type\":\"AllLabels\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"id\":\"1040\",\"type\":\"LinearScale\"},{\"attributes\":{\"axis\":{\"id\":\"1046\"},\"coordinates\":null,\"dimension\":1,\"group\":null,\"ticker\":null},\"id\":\"1049\",\"type\":\"Grid\"}],\"root_ids\":[\"1031\"]},\"title\":\"Bokeh Application\",\"version\":\"2.4.3\"}};\n",
