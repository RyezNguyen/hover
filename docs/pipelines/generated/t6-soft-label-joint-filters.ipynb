My main purpose for posting it here is to show that a _plausible_ argument can be made against extra-marital sex.  At this stage I am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or anything like that, just that it is plausible.  To try to convince you all of this particular point of view, I would probably have to do a lot of work researching what has been done in this field, etc., in order to gather further evidence, which I simply do not have time to do now.

I never would have expected him in the #1 spot.  It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points higher in both leagues than any other year.  Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.  Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell :->.  The other elite fielders in the league.  This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average. His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  Add another to the elite fielders list.  Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low 1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988 (best year ever) brings his average up a lot.  Strange last two years.  According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base. But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).  Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.  Last year -- a fluke or a portent?  Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?  Brook  is declining.  Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third.  Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about 10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.  Moving back to second was a good idea.  So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.  Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.  Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.  Not a good fielder.  Both are better off at shortstop.  Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to have helped his fielding any.    Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest DA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean. --  Dale J.

Nobuya \\\"Higgy\\\" Higashiyama replied (as, in substance, did others):   > Where is your source of moral standards by which you judge God's  > behavior?  It is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge God's actions.  Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a contrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of   + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.  + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?  + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!  + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  I am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and can perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as   + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!  There are those who say that the definition of \\\"good\\\" is \\\"whatever God happens to want.\\\" But if that is so, then the statement that God is good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants. That being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He is good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is powerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he tells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes sense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you don't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to Genesis 18 and to Christianity in general.  Any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any further discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God) meaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements are always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements in particular cases about the course of action most likely to achieve a good result.  When I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in history, those actions often seem to me very different from what I might expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us. Moreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural world, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might \\\"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of the Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort of difficulties that they find in Nature.\\\")  Now, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an argument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God. On the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose that I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every time he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: \\\"Good move! Just what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if I were playing.\\\" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a chess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at least some of his moves will have me thinking, \\\"Now, what do suppose induced him to do that?\\\" or even, \\\"Boy, that was a real slip -- he's just thrown the game away!\\\" Similarly, if God understands the workings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that sometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.  One difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the controls of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess game. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was carelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier. However, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did not take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had thought.  With God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total result of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging that I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier than my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.       *****     *****     *****     *****     *****  In the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers, who (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell him into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and when there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his family. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \\\"Do not worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.\\\"           The history of the Jews is largely a history of events    that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued    survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,    amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews    and of Judaism.         The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup    of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of    the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out    of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if    they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have    intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into    their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few    generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a    disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into    the Promised Land.         Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered    sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,    destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of    the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would    be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.    Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of    assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the    worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility    cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human    sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never    again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.    Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the    Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.         Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming    simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only    prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem    every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,    with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place    of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the    Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in    danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,    that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the    controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish    people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge    of all humans everywhere.         Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by    that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather    the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined    to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and    the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might    think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.    The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah    portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage    from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss    that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of    Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)    were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it    had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would    probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism    saved them.          [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]          Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became    famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR    LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,    everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on    stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the    studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast    Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she    later realized that if she had played the screen role, she    would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.    It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney    offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for    it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking    at Walt Disney, she said, \\\"And now, my special thanks to the    man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\\\" It was the most    memorable line of the evening.         In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in    the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive    to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing    with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus    Epiphanes....  After the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him privately and said, \\\"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren't you?\\\" He answered, \\\"If that is an example that came to your mind, then you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not talk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\\\" I assume that he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no state of Israel.  Someone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion that God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His purposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that He stirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and that when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go. And this raises questions about how an action can be considered wicked and at the same time be considered something that God has brought about.  I suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log, instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot that spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers the wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the knot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that observers will say: \\\"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its presence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a great work of art.\\\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was looking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not contained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art, but a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God would still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people, but He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not betrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected Jesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if Pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set Jesus free, it might appear that there would have been no Crucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no Salvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If Judas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled the world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know how Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its interior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and just as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth game agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops and had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up the game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is none the less valid).  Thus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of Pilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice was not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's plans by behaving justly and courageously.  What, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \\\"I will harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go\\\"? Some Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet with God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty were not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather that what God was telling Moses was something like this: \\\"If you see that Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be discouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My purposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and let the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his resistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future historians and theologians will suppose that I would have been thrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\\\"  To return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible that the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are instruments of God's will?      First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what Joseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong. They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment.      Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the good He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.\",\"Reported yesterday in the Washington Post (Kathy Sawyer, writer):  The article plays down the Russian role in US space.

The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them.

The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914 and David Llloyd George's budget. Even despite this the House of Lords has considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body.

It's understandable--most corporate execs don't know much about cryptology, and it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil.  And, the proposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what exists now.      The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have to concern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSA has put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs, probably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the existence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say) a DES keysearch machine.      As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination could acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since it would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked jodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency or organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak- nesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for (say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the complaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars to build a keysearch machine for.)      How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of the GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?  How about home phones of major execs and important engineers and designers? \\\"Gee, Mr Jones, I understand you've had some financial problems lately. Maybe I can help...\\\"        Indeed, if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likely as secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However, the system as a whole isn't resistant to \\\"practical cryptanalysis.\\\"  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes how several NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despite security measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.

Here's the box score followed by a few things I did pick up:  First Period:  Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51  Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp) Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda, Har (interference) 18:43  Second Period:  Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00  Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09  Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38 Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski, Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50  Third Period:  Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)  Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11  Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38 Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30  Overtime:  Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15. Penalties - None  Power Play:  Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4  Goalies:  Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)  Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)  On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took off.  The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.  The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie.  On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in. This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner, Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the play.  That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored, much less how.  From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy  Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark. But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????  What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...  #1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice. The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey next season.  #2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour, and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.  #3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season. Not a tough choice.  Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.  Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman in years to come.  Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some things you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome, he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year.  Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total. But consistency became a problem for him.

They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as many goals as they allowed, 319.  The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.  I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey News that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have no other way of getting them.  I hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have. Knowing the future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time almost bearable.

Good Luck,  \",\"Let me begin by saying I think this is the world's first religion to use the net as its major recruitment medium.  Therefore, even if this religion does not take off, its founding members will be very important historically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become  common.  The basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional morality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible's accounts of the facts and historical events is correct.  For example,  Story of Adam and Eve: Adam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited supply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says not to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide  in bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden. (There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in the bushes that might have angered God.)  Traditional Philosophy: 1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will provide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it's OK. This is why married women usually didn't work until recent decades. 2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler  and slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without  question by ordinary people, who can't make decisions for themselves.  Interpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy: They were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God told them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were obligated to do whatever their \\\"Father\\\" said to.  Being forced to leave the  Garden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.  Lessons from Traditional Interpretation: 1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting. 2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \\\"welfare\\\") is ideal.  Get- ting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment. 3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad. 4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and  should do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for  themselves. 5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from learning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.  1990's philosophy: 1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless named \\\"Hillary Clinton\\\" or \\\"Murphy Brown\\\". 2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people  (binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.  Interpretation of events based on current philosophy: They were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge rather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge and (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them- selves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were  REWARDED by being allowed into the \\\"real world.\\\"  Lessons from new interpretation: 1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought. 2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \\\"welfare\\\") is at best a temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is ideal. 3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good. 4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and should consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and \\\"alter or abolish\\\" bad governments.  They should think for themselves. 5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge but should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children  without good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better life for their children (and themselves).  I have tentatively named this new philosophy \\\"The Church of Eveism\\\" because Eve's decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind's first good decision, instead of its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly a protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek  knowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the decision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention and desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it  until it was actively sought.  ---End serious discussion.

IMO, given the various ages of the Braves and Reds this season, that the Braves will be closer to their peak, while the Reds have slightly passed their peak.  Also, if you're going to compare Braves and Yankees, a more appropriate comparison to the '93 Braves might be the '23 Yankees.

I've got a Computer Engineering degree, yet I've spent the last 7 years writing software that people actually use.  Moreover, the salary distinctions are incorrect; I received 3 job offers upon graduation; the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were $7000/year lower!  My advice is to decide which classes and projects most interest you, and pick the major that allows you to take them.\",\"I got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production( toxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well  because of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got  into Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium  would prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again here. But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6  supplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).  Vitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams  per day).   1. Review Article \\\"Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney      stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C\\\" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.     5(3):110-129(1985).  But glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both  glycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this  production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine,  but to increase your intake of vitamin B6.   2. \\\"Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in       patients with kidney stones\\\" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)      200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary       excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.   3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria\\\" Clin. Sci. 38     :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day      showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.  For gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is  required for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for  oxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is  quite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.   The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40%  of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable  and the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto  6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic  acid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the  extra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a  very early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.  Med. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day  increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg  per day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was  increased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose  and 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion  before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average  before supplementation.  B6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There  are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about  yet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the  speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must  have an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then  explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C  challenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your  intake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you  take vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient  in B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate  kidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets  absorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day  showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309 -15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase  in urinary oxalate excretion.   Here are the high oxalate foods:   1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.     Contain at least 25mg/100grams   2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale,      peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.     Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.  If the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot  of latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points  out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your  intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being  absorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn't  have to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for  males and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake). B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more  per day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).    The USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day  for males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with  this low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6  requirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that  either block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6  excretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol, isoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to  supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that  increase the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking  birth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the  other drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your  dietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone  formation should be given B6 supplements.  One other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your  Ca/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is  calcium-oxalate.   4. \\\"The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of  patients with calcium oxalate calculi\\\"Invest.

There are actually about three times as many articles published in the  medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone  formation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in  stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier  post in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I  guess that he doesn't read the medical literature.  Oh well, since kidney  stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them, I thought  I'd tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor's office.

One solution, due to Derek Ho: when the popup is popped up, we SetValue its location -- which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the previous popup. The slow response can be avoided by calling GetValue first, and only using SetValue if the required location is different. The problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the location of the popup, so that the SetValue really does change the location of the popup.

Some of what I  would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may  never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars  as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and  a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief  in an afterlife.    The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks  and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light  crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.   Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live  in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The  impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped  into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life  forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels  (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains  one weekend, \\\"getting away from it all\\\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing,  malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed  the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80  miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters  much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.   But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't  fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever -  like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch  commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer,  truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.   If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at  least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.    To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage  of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at  8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the  local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it  if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could  be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky  while complaining about billboards proposed by others.

In April  1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A  number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German officials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian Paikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku. Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the creation of an Armenian SS formation in order   \\\"to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the   spirit of the Nazi ideas.\\\"  He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish homeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language radio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]  [1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106.

The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored by General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any  official position. His views were represented by his men in the respective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942. Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after a long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to Berlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1]   A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not 'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy. As such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians were the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August  1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.  [1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., pp. 112-113.  Need I go on?

When I run xev and press the F1 key, I get the correct value showing  up in the following two key events:    KeyPress event, serial 14, synthetic NO, window 0x2800001,   root 0x28, subw 0x0, time 2067815294, (67,80), root:(74,104),   state 0x0, keycode 16 (keysym 0xffbe, F1), same_screen YES,   XLookupString gives 0 characters:  \\\"\\\"    KeyRelease event, serial 16, synthetic NO, window 0x2800001,   root 0x28, subw 0x0, time 2067815406, (67,80), root:(74,104),   state 0x0, keycode 16 (keysym 0xffbe, F1), same_screen YES,   XLookupString gives 0 characters:  \\\"\\\"  Notice that the keysym being transmitted is correct; 0xffbe. But when I use the F1 key while in vi or in a program I wrote to  spit back the hex values of keyboard input, I only get <7f> <3e>.  Does anyone know why the high order bit is being filtered and what I can do to make sure that the entire 8bits make it through to the final application? Any help is greatly appreciated.  Please *email* any responses.\",\" The willingness of the majority of the people to give up their freedom in  exchange for a sense of safety is hardly limited to the USA, and is an  endemic problem in any human society of any appreciable size.  The structure  of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but  fighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have  comfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't really have the former,  in the long term, unless you have the latter.  One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird  cross between a libertarian and an \\\"establishment tool\\\" is that I end up  taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when  the government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my  lifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.    As a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government  to be \\\"fair\\\".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed,  whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the  government would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem.   What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal,  so much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong)  sense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth  it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its  citizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the  major architects of the American system of government, figured that in a  couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it  would be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.  I  agree, and while I don't go around trying to spark one, I'll certainly  participate if it happens when I'm around.  There is a reason I am such a  strong supporter of individual rights while being so cynical about politics.   I've already written off politics.  And yes, this may get me in trouble some day.

Back to your regularly scheduled flame fest. \",\"  \\\"Deeply rooted rivalry?\\\" Ahem, Jokerit have been around since 1967 and joined the top flight only in the early '70s. Helsingfors IFK have been around since 1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think you're exagerating here.   That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian & American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean Burke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn  McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been  3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the  Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford  or Tampa Bay currently are doing. --- But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia?  Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:  (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=NHL regular+) (13-17=NHL regular) ( 8-12=role player)  FINLAND:    D-Jyrki Lumme.......20 D-Teppo Numminen....20 D-Peter Ahola.......13  C-Jari Kurri........25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16  R-Teemu Selanne.....27  L-Esa Tikkanen......20 (Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)  SWEDEN: D-Ulf Samuelsson....21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom...18 D-Calle Johansson...18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin......13 D-Tommy Albelin......7  C-Mats Sundin.......26 C-Thomas Steen......18  R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen........18 R-Michael Nylander..13  L-Per-Erik Eklund...18 L-Johan Garpenlov...16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon........14  This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's Selanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL. --- Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America. Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in  Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points. Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \\\"dynasty\\\" talk isn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time, won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top  Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a  couple of years the same way Edmonton's \\\"dynasty\\\" crumbled in the late '80s.  Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an  exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a  compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during  the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this,  the amateur draft should be open to anyone.  \",\"On the Lindros \\\"trade\\\":  Like Ottawa would be stupid enough to get Lindros.  Why do you think Quebec traded him?

On one of the Sundays just before Easter I went to church.  The sermon was based on a story in the Book of Joshua.  (The one about Joshua sending out spies to the land he was planning to take)  What I particularly remember, because of having heard part of a CBC radio documentary on Bosnia, was that the Rahab (the woman who sheltered the spies) said that the people were \\\"melting in fear.\\\"  What with having heard that CBC radio documentary and knowing that the Muslims in Bosnia were losing the war, I felt uncomfortable.  After all, the Serbs are driving non-Christians out.  On the other hand, ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the values held by our secular society.  Anyhow members of that church are involved in out-of-country missionary work.  Also, the pastor has talked of spiritual warfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area.  The next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites take Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except for Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about Bosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that the massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered me was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I shouldn't be so troubled about the reports of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" in Bosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims. Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing God's work?\",\"I am a student at UW-Eau Claire.

The problem is as follows:  If I use any Windows driver at 800x600 except for the 64K-colour driver (ie 16 colour or 256 colour), the image on screen becomes too tall - no amount of resizing on the monitor will make it fit.  And if I use Excel with the 64K- colour driver, it hangs as soon as it loads.  Anyone out there used this card/experienced anything similar.  Please reply by mail, and I will post any solutions here.  Regards    - Simon   -- \",\"       Alan, you can start by teaching your children that the perpetrators of crimes no more represent the \\\"Black community\\\" than racist hateful Whites represent the majority culture (although there are many ethnic minorities who have fallen into the very trap that you are struggling with, and believe otherwise). The trap is the easy way out.  For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race, and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're going to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors leading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than not, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.  If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few Blacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then worry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable or whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to define \\\"us\\\" and \\\"other\\\" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational humans.  It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the *most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial makeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in San Francisco, a city that loves to tout its \\\"ethnic diversity\\\". Here, we have Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the \\\"model minority\\\") gangs, and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly troublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on the street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and crime are what they most fear. During the \\\"disturbance\\\" in Los Angeles last year many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I remember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs where there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned from TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives that live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly multi-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that in the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black* riot!  In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points that really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the racism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As a people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem becomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly believe that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current course of denial and repression.  I wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors, luck in avoiding the \\\"trap\\\".   Peace, my brother.    m. --    \",\" Geez.

I must congratulate your analytical and excellent reportage about  Diana. From  the writings  of tye biographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe chauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian genes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian, she   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong characteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian ancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian from  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant Thedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady Diana. It is noteworthy  that Eliza Kewark was also referred  to as  Mrs. Forbesian  (a characteristic Armenian  surname  ending).  An  Armenian-Scottish gene mix is dynamite.  Levon K. Topuzian Assistant Professor Northwestern University Skoie, Illinois.  TIME, December 21, 1992 'Letters'   You have set up straw horses and knocked them down. I'm not impressed. Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.   Source: Stanford J. Shaw, on Armenian collaboration with invading Russian armies in 1914, \\\"History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey (Volume II: Reform, Revolution & Republic: The Rise of Modern Turkey, 1808-1975).\\\" (London, Cambridge University Press 1977). pp. 315-316.  \\\"In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city   of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population,   closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan   on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized   and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during   the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the  southern side of the lake.\\\"  \\\"Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,  Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.  Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First  World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse  to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other  invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian  success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of  Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common  soldiers began deserting in droves.\\\"  \\\"With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of  World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy  increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,  Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn  massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of  expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.\\\"  Serdar Argic\",\"We are Dartmouth engineering students.We are looking for documented data regarding the wear associated with turning on an off a monitor and how it relates to power consumption.

After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was  very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).  It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.  The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb. McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball. So on & so forth.

Here is a reply to one of the letters.  Seems to me that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell!]    Your using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers.  Of course, in your termonology, God could not \\\"cease to exist.\\\"  However, that is not what death ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see that it signifies \\\"separation.\\\"  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is the reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one member of the Godhead was separated from the other two.    I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived.  She was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my \\\"girlfriend\\\" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were separated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided that she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was death.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not because He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go there.      When I rebelled against my earthly father, he spanked me.  I found no wisdom in that until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued on my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and unloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us do as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh.  You have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.     This may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.  Jesus most certainly felt the \\\"pinpricks\\\" of life.  As the Scripture say:  Heb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.  The kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes when He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine to think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  \\\"The Consciousness of Christ.\\\"  I have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study, including clh.    It is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually suffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we do.  He \\\"grew in knowledge.\\\"  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose to be taught.  It is my understanding that He was \\\"led of the Spirit\\\" to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and Jesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him, the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise.  That is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was living sequential history as you or I.    Maybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not.   I was once a member of that club.  THe \\\"free thinker\\\" is a glorious ideal.  By contrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right.  But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his \\\"rational doubt\\\" when in fact he was led to it by his \\\"faith\\\".  He must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a \\\"free thinker\\\" to criticize the Christian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize him as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.  Pascal pointed out that \\\"sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.  Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.\\\"  The fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms, hence the term \\\"a\\\"-theist.  Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In my campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember.  However, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word, every point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.  That is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out \\\"Look, your fly is undone!\\\"  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity.  The answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on presuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral.  In other words, another myth.    Presuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence.   Of course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first \\\"Highlander\\\" movie.  But again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of God.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His prophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you are to reject God's annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct understanding of Himself.\",\": The Selective Service Registration should be abolished.

I own a turbocharged one, and I would never buy a turbocharged vehicle unless I knew the owner and his/her driving/maintenance habits.   I have been wondering about that myself.  The '90 AWD models and the '91s were identical (except for the ABS option).     Yes.  Some owners had problems with the transaxles.  Using synthetic lubricants in the transaxles solved the problem in most cases.  The problem was not unique to the AWDs, however.  It was common to all models.  The Galant VR4 and GSX had the same transaxle, but I didn't see those listed in CR.   I don't know of any major complaints in this area, except that the battery that was installed at the factory had a low current rating.    The first FWD models (those built before May 1989) were recalled for brake upgrades.  Some FWD and AWD owners had problems with warped rotors.  Those of us who insist on using manual torque wrenches every time the lug nuts are tightened have never had a problem.   I can refer you to someone who has gone through a set of pads in one day!

It's only been in the last year or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature. VW assumed that  automatic belts would satisfy govt. requirements for passive restraint, but didn't guess that the 'merican consumer would actually make buy decisions based on the presence of an airbag.  VW is really hurting right now in the US market.  Check out the article in last week's Autoweek about the crisis at VW.  Golfs and Jettas will be coming from the plant in Mexico, but they don't have the quality at that facility.  As per normal VW practice, the US launch of the Jetta III is delayed again and again, until a good chunk of the useful life of the design is spent.

The rockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, to distinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-made ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines with graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A \\\"D\\\" engine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse. An \\\"F\\\" engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to a doubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size \\\"O\\\" are available pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above are shipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines of size F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not as controlled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocket engines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.)  There is an HPR Society, The Tripoli Rocket Society, I believe, which holds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities (FAA waiver included) taken care of. The National Association of Rocketry is more concerned with engines below H, though it is involved in HPR as well. These societies certify users of HPR rockets, and companies will not sell to uncertified individuals.  Bottom Line: It's legit.

One of my users has a Duo 230 ([*]specifications below) that has been having slowdown problems. Leaving the Duo on for several hours causes it to slow down unacceptably. It can take 10-15 seconds to change applications. During this time it is completely hung.  If he reboots, the problem goes away (For a while). It seems the system is getting itself into a wedged configuration.  He's re-installed System 7.1 and rebuilt the desktop. Neither of these have helped.

It was appended to this thread by  accident. \",\" As a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer the circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentary opening and closing of the path.  The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high impedance audio circuits a resistive \\\"T\\\" is constructed close to characteristic impedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers the audio.  In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are shorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic impedance.  Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.  Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to \\\"Make before break and Vica Versa\\\" but I haven't seen any of these for years.  Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.  A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive \\\"optical isolator\\\".. It consists of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is off the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers passing the audio.  Once again this device in a \\\"T\\\" switches the audio.  Varying the lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and you have a mixer!

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is the National Security Agency (NSA)? * What are the US export regulations? * What is TEMPEST? * What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax? * What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch? * Is RSA patented? * What about the Voynich manuscript?   * What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?    The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It   was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and   has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is   known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,   and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the   world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of   cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many   years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break   many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national   security almost all information about the NSA is classified.    Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of   the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the   difference between public and private research in cryptography:    ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,   one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted   behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged   today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of   those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10   years has there in fact been widespread open research in   cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts   between these two research communities. Open research is common   quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open   exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in   scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with   responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,   countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can   a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might   undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?   One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would   force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one   must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with   political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most   scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have   occurred between government agencies and open researchers in   cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which   we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''  * What are the US export regulations?    In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control   export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export   Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by   the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office   of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized   by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule   of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent   requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see   everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.    The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting   discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what   people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which   go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to   consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in   jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at   least heard of the ITAR.  * What is TEMPEST?    TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer   equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that   information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at   quite a distance and with little effort.    Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext   is available this way.  * What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?    (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for   corrections.)    The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas   Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass   of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving   three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the   location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.   Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;   it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the   Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;   many documents have been tried as the key to B1.    Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various   means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:    The Beale Cypher Association   P.O. Box 975   Beaver Falls, PA 15010    You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the   line:    send index    in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.   (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher   floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,   says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)    Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of   problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI   and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.   Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this   string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an   explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this   string.  * What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?    The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis   on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with   pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes   articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in   English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,   Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.    Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;   less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent   to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.  * Is RSA patented?    Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.   For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been   granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral   issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information   about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of   the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as   ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other   technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.  * What about the Voynich manuscript?    nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the   subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list   is: <voynich-request@rand.org>    the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich\",\" Standard colormaps were spec'd with the intention that window managers would make them available. This doesn't mean that every window manager author in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and implemented this at top priority.  The ESGE server we ship makes the XA_RGB_BEST_MAP available at startup. It doesn't wait for window managers to do it.   Does your hardware have only one CLUT? Since standard colormaps typically devour all 256 entries, there is no way it can avoid displacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one CLUT.  I don't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible colormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. Rather, colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the same standard colormap. An example would be two clients that need a full color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP (or whatever it's called under X11R5).  If you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default colormap, your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into that colormap. If you can't do that, then you'll get flashing on a one hw CLUT framebuffer.  Now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your client, this flashing could also be avoided. Perhaps some window managers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps? -- \",\":  : >I bought it, I tried it: :  : >It is, truly, the miracle spooge. :  : >My chain is lubed, my wheel is clean, after 1000km. :  : Good, glad to hear it, I'm still studying it. :  : >I think life is now complete...The shaft drive weenies now : >have no comeback when I discuss shaft effect. :  : Sure I do, even though I don't consider myself a weenie...   ---------------- rip! pithy \\\"I'm afraid to work on my bike\\\" stuff deleted ---  : There is also damn little if any shaft effect : with a Concours.

Hope this helps.\",\" Based on my experience with a '79 FJ40 ( the hard-top jeep-style model ) I  would definitely give a new model consideration if I were in the market. The older models are VERY well built. Unless Toyota lost its mind, I would assume, until  proven otherwise, that the newer models have inherited some if not all of the qualities of their ancestors.  Two major differences in the running gear (that I'm aware of) need study. My '79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have independant front suspension. The solid axle is theoretically stronger and more reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The independant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy the typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. I'm not sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive system. The older Landcruisers have a \\\"lock-up\\\" type. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.\",\" Radius speculated, publicly, that they could provide a PowerPC-based Rocket for existing Macs. It would have the plus of RocketShare and the minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator, NuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.  Apple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except perhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC slot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC accelerators.  One potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will need a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with Rocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.  Apple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in existing 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreaking prices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seen much cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.  First generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed CPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later. This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled for clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which I doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do this, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as standard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where Apple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup is in order.  By the way, last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC, Pentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessor front for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies. Also, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and all the other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent right now.  Once anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's market position will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially if AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it might). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome battle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while not guaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one of several.\",\" That's not all that Kratz doesn't know.

I can hardly imagine what the result would have been if the Clinton administration had actually supported this plan, instead of merely acquiescing with repugnance as they've so obviously doing.

However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the center.  (These measurements are statistical, and you can always hide a sufficiently small number of a different type of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming that there is only one population of GRBs).  The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center of the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets way beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing GRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to be released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.  If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy) you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of the Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center (for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if they are Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in radius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, the Earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.   The aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don't see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.   There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature.

If a player is on the ice when his team scores a lot of goals and only allows a few goals, he must be doing something right. It is especially useful to compare between teammates- as they play for the same team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equally good players.  It can be adjusted- with varying degrees of success to compare between players on different teams.  I agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics- but how useful are the ones that you suggest??  Total ice time would be very useful- it is a missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before.  Somehow measuring the quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless.  It would be a better stat for evaluating coaching- ie are the players given quality ice time actually their talented ones?  A very good player could be given low amounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who doesn't recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of quality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that thinks he is an effective player.

There are verifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments abusing gun-control restrictions.  I don't think it is paranoid to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused in thye future.  After so many times of getting burned any sane person will stop putting his hand on the stove.          I'd love to.  But as long as the politicians grab power to sell pork back to their constituents, there's not a lot I can do.           It's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trust the government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed to do it, then we should change governments.  Down that road lies total government power.   I've never been a fan of totalitarianism.          This is very likely.          The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many people would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they're here.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is necessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should have always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don't. Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more magical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more heavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument.          No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S., two-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suicide rates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about half the per-car death rate.         The problem's been humans since before we had stone axes.  The fct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody, whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally irrelevent.        Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderous impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.        Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even if we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.           In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms. (50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per  se, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's countries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've got more knives or fists.           In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S. have been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms of prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they are doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is  violent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The *vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of 99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that you can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.          The situation is not \\\"good\\\" in that people fear for their lives. But recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots, protecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they, too, lost their livelihoods?          The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn't. However, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can be appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition won't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.         You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  If you're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully simply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough, as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)          45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun. That accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans. Firearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the group *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.         You may take that for what it's worth. \",\"it doesnt matter what window mgr you running under, you can use the X routine:  XIconfiyWindow(display, w, screen_number)   Display *display;   Window w;   int screen_number;  as in   XiconifyWindow( XtDisplay(w), XtWindow(w), 0);  does that perform what you want??

Either you don't read very well or resort to falsehoods in an attempt to make a point.  At the risk of boring and belaboring the point, my claim was the chain was regarding the tanks \\\"last used in Detroit in 48\\\". The text follows.  :  You did not merely claim that : tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress : sniper fire and that they were \\\"quite\\\" effective at this.    Indeed, when Coffman claimed they were only used as APCs, I did say I had been told they did fire their main guns.     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ : You continue to : back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is : disputing.  Well, the poster who I responded to did dispute the use of tanks post-48.  Rude of you to call Gary Coffman a nobody.    : \\\"Well, it's not the main gun.\\\"  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you : now going to admit that you were wrong?  That was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?    --------------------------------------------------   \\\"I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.\\\"    --------------------------------------------------    I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words, \\\"bullshit filters\\\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.    What was it I claimed as fact?  Here's the entire post:   --------------------------------------------------  Correction.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, it was well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions it in his song \\\"Black Day in July\\\".   --------------------------------------------------    Since you don't dispute that and claim that nobody else does, that means I was right.    : I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67 : riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place : without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American : military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have : been *big* news.     So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48.    Awesley goes on:   You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.  : To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion : grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be : perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since : it makes your other claim seem more plausible.  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.   : If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been : screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about : it.      Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot. Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \\\"several\\\".  I've also heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd assert that I claimed they were truth.  : Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up.      Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks. So it would have been an Army cover-up.     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.  : If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer : to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that : those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.     Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe that they did fire their guns.

I broke the second rule of humor\\\" Copeland\",\"  I will answer this as I find time.   Notice what I said about this book.  I called it \\\"Easy reading.\\\"  The reason I dropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical Simon's.  I don't know how many walking encyclopedia's I ran across in philosphy classes.  The problem isn't in knowing sooooo much more than your average lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it.  Schaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he was writting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was to simple.  I've talked with Schaeffer one on one.  I've been in lectures with the man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof's from secular as well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories)  His answers were enough that the prof's themselves often were taken back and caused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again at different open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well, simplistic.  It certainly isn't grad level reading.  But we must get off our high horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think most people would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more to say about this secular scientist at another time.  Also, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent* inquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt base.    Look, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we must add a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none in keeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we know its limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust it of all value!  THis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic.  It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christian faith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, we fly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic lesson of life:   \\\"More without limits is less;  less with limits is more.\\\"    Or as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/o freedom.  Let's put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to absurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell the difference between the two if you will let it.  Christianity's contention with rationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has very little else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust go hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called to go on by itself without his understanding.  This is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if the Christian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgment and say, \\\"Father I do not understand you but I trust you.\\\"  Now don't read all your objections of me into that statement.  I wasn't saying I do not understand you at all, but I trust you anyway.\\\" It means that \\\"I do not understand You *in this situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway\\\"  Therefore I can trust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mystery unrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter is a statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of Faith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It is not a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always know why, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all the difference.  Now, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted company with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit more difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith like the insistent \\\"whying\\\" of a 3 year old.  It isn't just that we would like to know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannot know.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the other leads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is in coming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after coming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always need to know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to grasp that, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand may count decisevely against what we are able to trust.    If, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trust him in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xian leaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which allows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may be ambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery to us, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity. And that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in practice.   \",\"I was wondering if someone could point me to somewhere I could find a list (and hopefully comparison) of all the convertibles that are out these days.

Perhaps you should examine in yourself why as such a good friend, you  are unwilling to accept this imortant part of your friends life?  Why  do you call into question his faith?  Your friend has changed, he has  found something that fills a need in his life.  You need to decide if  you are still his friend, whether you can accommodate his new life.   It sounds as if you are criticizing him for a fundamental belief in  the Bible, yet you are quick to reveal that your fundamental belief  that it is superstition.  Perhaps if he knew you at least took him  seriously, that you at least took an interest in the light he has found,  that you at least tried to understand what has become a special part of  his life, you could together decide to become fundamentalists, respect  each others differences and remain friends, or part ways.  Maybe even if  you stuck it out with him, you could help him to un-convert.  Of course,  if you go in with that attitude he will surely see through your intentions  and begin to resent you.

I didn't switch my beliefs, but for those at home who maybe need a friendly face to invite them somewhere, the Witnesses provide a wonderful service.

This doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.    Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be, and isn't.     I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement.   First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ  could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the  male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.   Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.   Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism is an attractive option.   I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.) should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\",\"Awhile back someone posted some information on where you can get kits to build an EEG.

Blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration rate for violent crimes.  So I doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism present.  There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories.  Interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in the rest of the United States! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt blacks.  In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).  Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a situation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.

One would be the stupidity of the government's actions.   Amusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable for a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware? In DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you just swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect on the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of that cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that it would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search algorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware. I have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.   However, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its  designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion  of such techniques seems credible.  Hmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name \\\"Clipper\\\" for this device. :) \",\" Makes sense, since the new Mercedes Benz engines go from 2.2L-4 to a 2.8L-6. Nothing in between.  BTW, I beleive the numbers on those MB engines are 156 and 225 hp respectively.  The one-upmanship in hp might induce BMW to create a larger six.  Also, the 2.6 190E has lagged behind the 3-er 2.5 for some time wrt hp.   I am sure the Bavarians wouldn't want to be \\\"shown-up\\\" by the Schwabians.

If there is an once of truth iin it, I'm sure Anas Omran can document such a sad and despicable event.  Otherwise we may assume that it is another piece of anti-Israel bullshit posted by someone whose family does not know how to teach their children to tell the truth.  If Omran would care to retract this 'error' I would be glad to retract the accusation that he is a liar.  If he can document such a claim, I would again be glad to apologize for calling him a liar.  Failing to do either of these would certainly show what a liar he is. \",\"After tons of mail, could we move this discussion to alt.religion? ============================================================= --There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.

This morning about 6:00, the feds punched holes in the compound walls by using a tank.  They  then started using non-lethal tear gas.  Shortly after noon, 2 cult members were seen setting fire to the compound.  So far, about 20-30 people have been seen outside the compound.  The fate of the other 60 or 70 people is unknown, neither is the fate of the 17 children that were inside.  The compound did burn to the ground.  Koresh, who at times has claimed to be the Messiah, but then backed off and only claimed to be a prophet, had promised several times to come out peacefully if his demands were met.  First, he demanded that his message be broadcast on the radio, which it was, but he didn't come out. He claimed to be waiting for a message from God.  Finally, he said that God told him that he needed to decipher the mystery of the 7 seals in Revelation, and when he was finished, he'd come out.  He finished the first one, but didn't do any more work that anyone knows of since then. The federal agents did warn him that if they didn't come out, they  would be subjected to tear gas.  I think it's really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere man, even if he did claim to be the son of God, and/or a prophet.  I think it underscores the importance of putting you faith only in things that are eternal and knowing for yourself what the Scriptures say and what they mean, instead of relying on others to do it for you, even if those others are learned and mean well.\",\"This kind of argument cries for a comment...     : >>...God did not create : >>disease nor is He responsible for the maladies of newborns. : >  : >>What God did create was life according to a protein code which is : >>mutable and can evolve.  Without delving into a deep discussion of : >>creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code : >>perfect and without flaw.  : >  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~  Do you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and has degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement, shouldn't we?  Perhaps the biggest \\\"imperfection\\\" of the code is that it is full of non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains.  Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that intron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes.   On the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted later, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused, if introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated, since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are conserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and these are not found in or near intron sequences.   I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting \\\"theological arguments\\\" like this.  Try Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish & Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.  : Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does : God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a : theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely : scientific perspective, just different.  Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas  theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.   : I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect, : but that doesn't mean it's perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.  For the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support your assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective, unless you support it by some evidence.  In fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we've thought - for instance, sex might have evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by computer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.)    : Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma : rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.  In fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action.   : Actually, neither of us \\\"knows\\\" what the atmosphere was like at the : time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most : biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after : all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth : was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I : seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for : the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?  I'd replace \\\"created\\\" with \\\"formed\\\", since there is no need to  invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one. Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8 billion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but organic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years. This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve.  I'm sorry I can't give any references, this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry I attended here.   : >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer : >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of : >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the : >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.    Again, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for this supposed \\\"degeneration\\\"?   I can understand Scott's reaction:  : > Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be : > jesting.  Do you know what pathogens are?  Do you know what  : > Point Mutations are?  Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME : > ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY?!!!!!   :  : In response to your last statement, no, and neither do you. : You may very well believe that and accept it as fact, but you : cannot *know* that.  I hope you don't forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests  everything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against this conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in  anything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the  right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so, and not to present one's own conclusions prior to this.   Theology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions.  : >>Human DNA, being more \\\"complex\\\", tends to accumulate errors adversely : >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the  : >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in  : >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence : >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial : >>diseases/disorders.  You are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators from degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to  survive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it  to the present.   And for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection, and thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for either claim.   : But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in : answering John's question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases, : and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require : babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God's fault? (the original : question) -- I say no, it is not.  Of course, nothing \\\"evil\\\" is god's fault.  But your explanation does not work, it fails miserably.   : You may be right.  But the fact is that you don't know that : Satan is not responsible, and neither do I. :  : Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it : be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills : that affect mankind?  I don't think so.  He could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is, it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution.  : Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference. : Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the : point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I : never said that people are \\\"meant\\\" (presumably by God) \\\"to be : punished by getting diseases\\\".  Why I did say is that free moral : choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject : God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not : expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic : universe.  I am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone. I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer is not as clear-cut as it seems to be.  What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?    : Oh, I admit it's not perfect (yet).  But I'm working on it.  :)  A good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.  : What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the : question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are : fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain : *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don't explain : the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.  Why is there a \\\"why behind\\\"? And your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend these books.  Is there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence for this? If the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al) suggest, why do people still insist on this?   : Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am : not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details : of biology and genetics, although I'm sure I'd find it a : fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do : not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the : beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its : environment.  I'm sorry, but they do. There is no evidence for your big picture, and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation. It can come into existence without a Supreme Being.  Try reading P.W.

Josh backon@VMS.HUJI.AC.IL  \",\" A question for you - can you give me the name of an organization or a philosophy or a political movement, etc., which has never had anything evil done in its name?  You're missing a central teaching of Christianity - man is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing that, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all who consider themselves \\\"christians\\\" are (even those who manage to head their own \\\"churches\\\").  \\\"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.\\\" - Matt. 7:21.   Again, what historical documents do you trust?  Do you think Hannibal crossed the Alps?  How do you know?  How do you know for sure?  What historical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis- credit it as well as the Bible has?   Well, it's really a shame you feel this way.  No one can browbeat you into believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving you further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions: 1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain it.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this salvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain modern offshoots like the \\\"new age movement\\\" teach or does he require God's help?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such help come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for some people it did comprise their life's writings, so I am hardly in a position to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few, of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me). The spritual life is a difficult journey (if you've never read \\\"A Pilgrim's Progress,\\\" I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).   Now I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a conflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You wrote that \\\"I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most of the teachings of christ\\\".  Well, Christ referred to God as \\\"My Father\\\", not \\\"My Mother\\\", and while the \\\"maleness\\\" of God is not the same as the maleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not honor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory, or politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women -  english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human population.  Well, I'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion of the role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the last 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this article.  I just happened across yours and felt moved to reply.

If you read the surrounding passages you would understand what Jesus means by \\\"life in the world.\\\"  But as is, you bumbled around, asserted your standard axiom that the Bible is bunk, and came up with the wrong idea.  Also, you do not know exactly what Jesus means by eternal life.    Brian K., do you expect to jump in the middle of the quantum mechanics book and understand Hermite polynomials having not read the surrounding material?  Why do you such with the Bible?  For an idea what Jesus means by the world, look up references to it in your concordance.  For a good description, the whole Book of Ecclesiastes is game.  For  eternal life, check out John 17:3, John 3:15-16.  You will find that eternal life is quite different than what you think.  Eternal life starts NOW--an infinitely high quality of life living in fellowship with God.    If my diety exists, you would not just cease to exist.  Jesus talks of hell in Luke 16:19-31.       The truth is, is that it is not some sort of magic spell.  The truth is is that you do not understand it, and enjoy not understanding it.    Wrong again.

AAS - American Astronautical Society  Other groups not mentioned above\",\"   I've had the board for over a year, and it does work with Diskdoubler, but not with Autodoubler, due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies, the owners of the board's compression technology. (I'm writing this from memory; I've lost the reference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)  Using the board, I've had problems with file icons being lost, but it's hard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however, if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board, the icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensing problem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress a board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.  Since Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes in Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed. Which is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac's product since they're being so stinky.

This was a heresy that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD.  It grew up in reaction to Nestorianism, which held that the Son and Jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia and by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox.  It believes that Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which is correct), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfect harmony).  That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesus came in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a human will.  In reality, he had both, though neither made him subject to original sin. It is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to this conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but not two wills or two energies.  It also was condemned, at a late council in Constantinople I believe.  Andy Byler\",\"   Actually, that is no longer true.

There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive).     The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both      systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup /      restore program.  Both systems have 3.5\\\" and 5.25\\\" floppies.  2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon).  From what I have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possible solutions (I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about).  For these  options, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees  any flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y, etc.) in my thinking  (I don't know very much about these beasts):  1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.     Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand?     What do the floppies themselves cost?   2.

Granted, the document may be asking you and I to help out Traders, but in the big scope of things, I feel that we would do all gun owners a favor by helping to this cause.  Anyway, here it is:  NEWSPAPER AD CENSORSHIP  Are you letting the newspapers tell you how to live your life, what's good for you, what's not, and exercise blatant censorship over what you read in their advertisments?  The newspapers have now decided to censor gun ads - which is why you no longer see the ads that Traders, San Leandro, has run for many years.  These ads were run for the law-abiding honest citizens who own firearms for sporting use or self-protection.  They certainly have the right to do so, under the Second Amendment Right to Bear Arms.  If you are tired of newspapers who run sex and liquor ads galor, yet refuse to run legitimate gun ads, please send a letter to the editors indicating your displeasure over their censorship doctrine.

It can convert bitmaps to Corel art format.  These can then be imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap. Result - the file is completely in Corel format and can be SCODAL'ed no problem!  BUT the slight problem with this, which makes the solution less than idea, is that the trace utility spits out many more points than are necessary to define the shapes being traced.  Straight lines and curves are both traced as many short segments.  So... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to image.

When graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft, presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft doesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes 'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational) envelope'.   Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are are the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilots do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this is done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans, such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed taxi tests).

The function of this spoof chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the family key   2) Receive Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming integrity of the      law enforcement block is necessary for local operation -      checksums, sequence control, etc.).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  It is probable theere is a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N (34 bits as used in generating U, U1,U2) correctness of the law enforcement block can be determined with only the family key F.  Whereas, no one has proposed Federal Agencies be denied F, and because they could recover it themselves, The correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits of N in E[N; F].  The one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above, but the mutilation could be detected.  A better approach would be to mutilate the entire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption scheme such as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement block can be recovered are lessened.  What do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the serial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmission becomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocol transmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?  One way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the block containing M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.  The goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to  detection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the law enforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original state for use by the clipper chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.  It is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within the clipper chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for, requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting and decrypting E(M; K);  The spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, including on the resulting serial data stream.  Existing clipper products could be subborned.  After all, they are high security encryption systems right?  Super encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without redress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serial number.  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number, which should not be recoverable by other means.  One can see the use of cut outs for procurring clipper phones, or once the number of units is high enough, stealing them.  It would be a mistake on the part of authority, but nice from a point of privacy, if the serial number N were not associated with a particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and  distribution process.  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolen clipper serial numbers N encrypted with F, and the protocols are not  sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream. This could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted stream.  Detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned scheme.  ******************************************************************************  If you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own, and use them in a codebook sustitution with your own, where they point to a valid law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching the remainder of the transmission, you could simply out and out lie, yet deliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement block.   These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators, such as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would require escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.  The M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream and the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key generator synchronized between endpoints.  The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission interception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there's supposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps to the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants an encryption chip with a real time clock?  *****************************************************************************\",\"Is clear coat really worth it?  Yes, on the showroom floor, the cars have this deep, lustrous shine that just can't be found on paint jobs that aren't clear coated.  On the other hand, it seems that every clear coated car that I've seen on the road (in a parking lot, etc.) has fine scratches throughout the paint job.  As does, alas, my 1992 Laser.  Several weeks ago I had my car professionally polished and waxed. When I picked it up, it had that same showroom shine that I remember from a year ago when I bought it.  Several days ago I took my car to the dealership for some work.  As an added bonus, they washed my car.  Unfortunately, whoever washed it either didn't get the roof (which is black, the rest of the car is red) completely clean before he dried it, or he used a dirty towel.  Now my showroom shine is a haze of fine scratches that aren't really visible until the light hits the roof at a particular angle.  I am, to put it mildy, somewhat peeved about this.  Do I have any  chance of getting the dealership to do something about this? My guess is 'no'.  Is there any product on the market that provides a solution to this problem?  Or am I faced with the prospect of having the car professionally polished again to hide the scratches?

It is its own OS, with (Billy Gates assures us) true  multi-tasking/multithreading, meets DOD security specs, will run win3.1  programs as well as DOS programs, has multi-processor support, and is primarily a Server program.  It's overhead is too high for it to be economical for most users.  Speaking of overhead, it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM.   It iwll run with 12, but that's like running OS/2 2.0 with 4 megs.  And that's  just to run it.  Also, I have heard that the system files take up 30-50 Megs,  and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig!  The SKD is distributed  on CD-ROM.  Chicogo is what I want to use.  It is, like NT, a true OS with thrue  multitasking and multithreading, but has much smaller hardware requirements,  and does not meet DOD security specs (but that's okay since it will probably  be more of a client OS).  there are a few otehr differences, but those are the  main ones.  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August.  The Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro$oft are in intense  competition, so it is said.  However, I think a different relationship will  arise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology), Chicogo will be the  client machine.  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together,  partly because Chicogo is just a small NT (think of it that way, anyway).   (Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS, so don't scorn the concept.)  Anyway, don't expect it soon.  Windows 4 and DOS 7 are supposed to be  released next year (read: see it in 95), so I expect that Chicogo won't be out  til '96.  With luck, I'll be proven wrong! =)  Rob\",\" [deleted]   I am glad that I am not an atheist.  It seems tragic that some people  choose a meaningless existence.

The second question is something that's been known for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quitting smoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the person who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in the interim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Still rather low overall, but significant.  Personally, I'd be more concerned about heart disease secondary to smoking -- it's much more common, and even a small increase in risk is significant there. \",\" Perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then.  To me, an absolute is something that is constant across time, culture, situations, etc.  True in every instance possible.  Do you agree with this definition?  I think you do:   A simple example:  In the New Testament (sorry I don't have a Bible at work, and can't provide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in church.  Now, this is scripture.  By your definition,  this is truth and therefore absolute.    Do women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all  scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and  coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.   Yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare  heads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew  up in.)  Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture  to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.) Can you reconcile this?   I don't claim that there are *no* absolutes.  I think there are very few, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.    But you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute.  How can you determine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can't agree how to interpret the Scripture?    It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based  on your own *interpretation* is absolute.  Do you deny that your own background, education, prejudices, etc. come into play when you read the  Bible, and determine how to interpret a passsage?

I've just finished reading S414, and have several questions about the Brady bills (S414 and HR1025).  1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill?      What is the status of these bills?  I've heard they're \\\"in committee\\\".      How close is that to being made law?  2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar.  Are there any important    differences I missed?  3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes:   A. S414 doesn't specify an \\\"appeals\\\" process to wrongful denial during      the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?)  (S414 has an appeals      process once the required instant background check system is established,      but not before).   B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approving      using existing records (so who would I sue in \\\"A\\\" above to have an      inaccurate record corrected?)   C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person      can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer (CLEO) of an      immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member.      But S414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a \\\"threat\\\", nor does      it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception      statement. True?  Have I misunderstood?  Any other 'holes?  4. With just S414, what's to stop a person with a \\\"clean\\\" record from    buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks?    At minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this?     'Seems at min. a \\\"gun counting\\\" scheme would be needed    (e.g., \\\"John Doe owns N guns\\\").

I am using Turbo C and would be grateful for any info or source fragments may help. When I was in Berlin this summer I saw a book which seemed to have all this information, but my German is poor to say the least, if anyone has this book could they please mail me.  My second request for help concerns standard file formats (how can a file  format be standard if you keep it secret ?) I need to know the file format  for instrument bank files *.BNK and Roland music files *.ROL.  Finally does anyone have a source for displaying PCX or GIF files to EGA or VGA monitors.  Please Help, You know it makes

 I am digitizing a NTSC signal and displaying on a PC video monitor. It is known that the display response of tubes is non-linear and is sometimes said to follow Gamma-Law. I am not certain if these non-linearities are \\\"Gamma-corrected\\\" before encoding NTSC signals or if the TV display is supposed to correct this.   Also, if  256 grey levels, for example, are coded in a C program do these intensity levels appear with linear brightness on a PC monitor? In other words does PC monitor display circuitry correct for \\\"gamma errrors\\\"?   Your response is much appreciated.

One of them replied to me personally after I posted this original message  several days ago. I have heard Jerry Pournelle suggest this idea before. \",\"  Good point. I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph, nor do they reach 155. However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:  a) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several 1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip I made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800 miles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I   would have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles. No problems with winds and curves.   Then there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where we were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.  b) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see no difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip back from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind you, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better than the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still get 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.    Now now, you can't compare a diesel with a gasoline engine. I see enough bmws and gasoline mercs for sale that have 100-150k miles on them and advertise  rebuilt engines. If honda was to build an accord for 30k, I'd darn well expect the sucker to last 300k miles.   Ever got caught behind a early 80's 300SDL at a stop light? It's not pleasant. The newer MB's are a lot better though. The diesel Volvos and VWs are probably the smelliest offenders.  As for economy, why should we care? Gas is cheap! I personally wouldn't buy a diesel car for any reason - what does it buy me?  Shantanu Ganguly Somerset (Motorola)\",\" Brad,    For an antenna, gain is synonymous with directionality.

Fred is basically correct:  no sophisticated tools, just a lot of effort and painstaking care.  But they got this one right *before* Challenger; Feynman cited the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people.  (He also noted that the software people were starting to feel management pressure to cut corners, but hadn't had to give in to it much yet.)  Among other things, the software people worked very hard to get things right for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failure during those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure. As a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be counted on one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.  As Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software. Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by the experimenters, and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care.

After Huizenga announced the team name, he announced that Bill Torrey is named the first president of the Panthers.  A little Bio from _Sun-Sentinel_ Torrey, the architect of four consecutive Stanley Cup champions as  persident and general manager of the New York Islanders. Throughout his 27 years in the NHL, Bill Torrey's bow ties have become as much of a signature as Andre Agassi's hair.  The Panthers will introduce a uniform, insignia, and ticket-price  information in early next month.  In the meantime, Huizenga leaves the day-to-day operation in the hands of Torrey and Bob Clarke, the VP and GM.  The Florida Panthers was chosen as the name of South Florida's NHL team to focus attention on an endangered species.  There are 30 to 50 Florida Panthers in the Everglades National Park, the Big Cypress National  Preserve and other parts of southwestern Florida.  \\\"The Panther is the quickest-striking of all cats,\\\" Torrey said.   \\\"Hopefully that's the way we'll play on ice.\\\"  More BIO: In Torrey, Huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion Islanders in 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the Islanders to four consecutive Stanley Cup championships (their first after only eight seasons) and 14 consecutive winning seasons.  As executive vice president of the California Golden Seals, Torrey watched the Seals go to the play- offs in 1968, only their second NHL season.  \\\"I guess this completes my own personal hat trick\\\", said Torrey, 58, a native of Montreal but a resident of Bear Lakes Country Club in Palm Beach.

What I mean is that our  culture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather than considering things with others in mind and not making prayer  an initial and primary part of the decision process. People tend to treat church as they would a club and when something is less than to their liking, off they go to another one.  I think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different  perspective on the \\\"church choosing process\\\". It seems to me from 1Cor 12 that God doesn't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all but that he places us in the body as he wants us. So, I think a better question is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out where God is trying to place me.  If a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church they go to is a logical first choice. You have been born into the family of God. People should hop around from church to church as often as they hop from natural family to family.  If you met the Lord on your own (so to speak) there may not be an  easily identifiable church to try for starters. Here you are more like an orphan. Prayerfully go and \\\"leave yourself on a few doorsteps\\\" and see if anyplace feels like home.   I wouldn't expect that God want to place you in a church where you have difficulty fitting in with the people, but on the other hand there are no perfect churches. If you have an attitude of looking for problems you will both find them and make them. On the other hand if you have an attitude of love and committment, you will spread that wherever you go.   In general, I think that God will try to place you in a church that talks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and is expanding on that base.\",\"I am looking for recommendations/experiences of bringing Macintosh CPUs onto Token-Ring Nets.

No : reasonable alternative exists.  I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime;  causes precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be an answer to \\\"how\\\" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from  \\\"nothing\\\", science has some good candidates for an answer.  I have always wondered why Christians use the \\\"There are questions science (or atheism) cannot answer\\\" argument; I hope this is the appropriate group to ask this question.  The most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the universe exist, or anything, for that matter?  I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely  1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?  and  2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?  It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However, is it a meaningful question, after all?  I would say it isn't. Consider the following:  A die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt one's very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else - I cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me - can I ever be sure I exist?  However, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone insert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )  A being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence. A being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would be pointless - the being would exist anyway.  Let us return to the original question: why? A being that does not exist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being is not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let us assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity postulate). The question \\\"why anything exists\\\" can be countered by demanding answer to a question \\\"why there is nothing in nothingness, or in non-existence\\\". Actually, both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist don't exist. Tautology at its best.  I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.  Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.  Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence. This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence, it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence. This argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists, and from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence. I think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.  The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.  The second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing? belongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the question can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge from vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent Hawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe, World Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more appropriate for discussions like this.   : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \\\"why\\\".  That isn't : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).  This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \\\"how\\\", not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \\\"why\\\" questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.   : I believe the \\\"genetic code\\\" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes, : but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining,  : reproducing life, *ever*.  (I've never been much of a prophet, though. I : can't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don't believe *any* : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.  This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?  There is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created, although not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolution contain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, although their code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent book  Steven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. Jonathan Cape, London 1992.  Artificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no  spark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do not violate any physical laws as we know them.   : You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your : research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you : really have nothing to worry about, eh?  Exactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelical atheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to  find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. I would normally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc, but it seems many Christians do not read these groups.

Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we aren't entitled to a \\\"peek under the covers\\\" as the Big Kids (NASA, for instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations, doesn't have a load of money to spend on computers every year, so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis. The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond.

(ie no one buys SCSI for ISA because ISA is slow) Are you saying that SCSI on an ISA bus is not an automatic winner when compared to IDE?   I get different transfer rates out of my IDE when I change my ISA bus speed.   IDE is just a variant of the old IBM- MFM AT controller.  (at least that's how it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different platforms.  Is there any argument that  IDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the drive is able to provide the data?  Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface (because of a higher RPM platter, different arrangement of heads, etc?)?   If data is going from one drive to another, and if SCSI has the ability to perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main memory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know, IDE can't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored in main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives  at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the same time?  Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA (or whatever) bus?   A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that's 245 million bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface, he gets close to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers?   So you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type, considering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or tape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and run DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives at the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years ago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice.   But on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you get more performance for the money.  For all the people that will only have a single hard drive in their system (regardless of the OS) will the SCSI choice really give them more performance than IDE?   True, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option is there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.   No argument.  This is always held up to the first time SCSI buyer as the best reason.  But how many SCSI devices will the first time SCSI buyer eventually acquire?  Again does it make sense to go SCSI for a single hard drive system?   With all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs, are you really sure that PC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible?  And even if they are,  is the data accessible from either machine (ie are there no formatting/ partitioning or file table differences?)  Is it really plug'n'play?   So the C: drive on the connor becomes a logical D: drive to DOS.  Is this really a problem?     After having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers, I have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor have I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or to/from the same drive.   That is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up).  I do believe that there is the possibility for up to 4 IDE drives on a PC. \",\"  So why did the Australian Customs Service make a public statement to a parliamentary committee last year that weapons smuggling was a problem which it was not able to control?

A pure X application could be implemented with Motif widgets, one of which would be an  XmDrawingArea for drawing with Xlib.  But I would like to take advantage of the Graphics Library (GL) available on our IBM RS/6000 (SGI's GL i believe).  Is it possible to mix X and GL in one application program? Can I use GL subroutines in an XmDrawingArea or in an X window opened by me with XOpenWindow?  I have never used GL before, but the doc on GL winopen() says that the first time winopen() is called it opens a connection to the server.   Also, most of the GL calls do not require a Display or GC, unlike most X calls.  From this initial information it appears that X and GL cannot be mixed easily.   Is this true?

I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation Institute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original announcement.)   For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems. Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev, Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.  I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines for future space craft use.  If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it's faculty have e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the receiver to get the message.  They are still a bit antiquated - but they are rapidly changing!

Where were they?                  An Appeal to Mankind  During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums, documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.  The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace.  The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.  Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland. Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan. Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives  of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.  One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection  of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance, for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled, its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over  the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the USSR and the United States.   One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent  events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on Azerbaijan.  It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we  are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic  Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.  But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000 Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the  neighboring lands.  The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales, suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.  But what about the lives of seven million human beings? If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their  colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other attributes?  All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.    THE COMMITTEE FOR PEOPLE'S HELP TO                  KARABAKH (OF THE) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES                  OF THE AZERBAIJAN SSR   But perhaps Turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the Caucasus in the name of peace and democracy. The Armenians are Christians, the Azerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved by the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights.   Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims at 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole thing has now gone entirely too far.   They already did. The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians  78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this  time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the  plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs.   Report taken from The New York Times, Tuesday, March 3, 1992                      MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED       Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today  of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh,  a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.      The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed 1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and  massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered mountain passes.      But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani reports of a massacre.                           Scalping Reported      Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them  from retrieving more bodies.      \\\"Women and children have been scalped,\\\" said Assad Faradshev, an aide to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. \\\"When we began to pick up bodies, they began firing at us.\\\" are lying there like flocks of sheep.

I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and    went inside.   The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for   its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an   iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black   with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As   the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face   up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what   was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted,   as with Tartars rather than with Turks.

Anyone keelhauled  so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into   laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense  of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,  Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would  have been.   From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....  The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over  the carcass of Djul.

Hundreds of feet   down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said   Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'

Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;  then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the  spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though   I heard our Utica brass roar.   As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing  of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,  dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow  puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.  The came a shrill wailing.   Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about  house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in  clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen  were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.   'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape  over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked  breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by  afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and  the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.   At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward  Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and   tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,  through alders, on smoldering houses.

Between   the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun   dress.   The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He   lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the   pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed   just below his neck, into the spine.

Serdar Argic\",\"Gordon Banks:  This certainly describes my situation perfectly. For me there is a constant dynamic between my tendency to eat, which appears to be totally limitless, and the purely conscious desire to not put on too much weight. When I get too fat, I just diet/exercise more (with varying degrees of success) to take off the extra weight. Usually I cycle within a 15 lb range, but smaller and larger cycles occur as well. I'm always afraid that this method will stop working someday, but usually I seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check. This is one reason I have a hard time accepting the notion of some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting (that results in long-term weight gain). I have been cycle- dieting for at least 20 years without seeing such a change.  I think a vigorous exercise program can go a long way toward keeping the cycles smaller and the baseline weight low.\",\"email your replies to:\",\" I don't think such a Canada is any more \\\"culturally similar\\\" to the United States than England.

But such cases represent less that 0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every case you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence where the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed. (0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure, based on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000 crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other  studies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000. Those figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences involve killing the attacker.)   So, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000)  cases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted in the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, in comparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicides make up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study considered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides prevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not be close to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.\",\"---------------------------------------------------------------------- Open letter by Dr. Paul H. Blackman, Research Coordinator for NRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89. -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear sir:  By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are drawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of  momentus \\\"scientific\\\" findings. These are regularly released to the press without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings. Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however meaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle serious studies by criminologists.  The latest effort -- \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities,\\\" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying  editorial, \\\"Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,\\\" by two employees of the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular order.   1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to   support the statement that \\\"some have argued that restricting  access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate  of homicide.\\\" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that  contention.    2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very  similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,  demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities  are very different with very different demographic characteristics  which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in  Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white  and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be  the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-  grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various  ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.    3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,  compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all  the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect  in 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-  1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth  involving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM  article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving  handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that  one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding  that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that  a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day  for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without  at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?    4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national  gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily  selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because  it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific  reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which  involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar \\\"control\\\"?  Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite  \\\"scientific\\\" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide  rate *exceeds* that of such \\\"wild west\\\" cities in Texas as  El Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado  Springs. (Ref. 3)    5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or  handguns \\\"are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in  Vancouver.\\\" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending  to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is  an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry  permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in  Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of  handguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun  owners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number  of handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns  for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns  legally for protection, registration figures are  meaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York  City (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,  that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population  in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver  has a greater \\\"prevalence of weapons\\\" than New York City.    The second method of measuring gun density is \\\"Cook's gun  prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity  differences.\\\" But the validation was by Cook of his own  theory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a  different doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is  based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement  in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking  a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide  (42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in  homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in  Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-  ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and  Vancouver.    6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and  Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that  Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to  the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian  law for owning and carrying handguns for personal  protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more  difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually  the case.    7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain  the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the  penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of   clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a  firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number  of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making  arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest  rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences  imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,  or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social  scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,  the authors of the NEJM \\\"tale of two cities\\\" fail even to mention  most factors related to crime control.    8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective  means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not  the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost  650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from  criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the  liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be  completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury  to the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors  reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides  without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle  accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides  involving firearms.    9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the \\\"study,\\\"  editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it \\\"applied  scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb  advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly  handguns.\\\" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly  be mistaken for \\\"scientific methods\\\" by a sociologists or  criminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle \\\"study\\\" is the equivolent  of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding  two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25  and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,  administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while  giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure  and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure,   announcing in a \\\"special article\\\" a new medical breakthrough.  It would be nice to think that such a \\\"study\\\" would neither be  funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.    Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC  make them willing to present shoddy research as \\\"scientific  breakthroughs\\\" in \\\"special articles\\\" and editorials relating  to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying  the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight  over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about  the distortions contained in \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,  and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities\\\" and \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call  for Science.\\\" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside  whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize  an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.

Wright           (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)     suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\\\"  The problem is demonstrated    by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting    to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by    the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal    of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and    suggested that a handgun ban \\\"may reduce the rate of homicide in a     community.\\\"       The nine medical doctors who published \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime,    Assaults, and Homicide\\\" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite    many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver    has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations    make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems    indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period    1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.    Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,    Why?       The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case    to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,    that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their    evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and     unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point    does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support    of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody    knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We    are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that    a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates    when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.       Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two    indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-    weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons    permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the    permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable. *     The second bit of evidence is \\\"Cook's gun prevalence index,\\\" which stands *  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index *  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in  *  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage *  of homicides and suicides involving firearms. *     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides, *  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take *  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be *  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides *  is directly related to their relative availability in the general  *  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To *  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to \\\"prove\\\" it on the basis of *  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.       Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that    guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.    The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun    ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates    reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,    that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.       In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of    violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the     consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin     Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime    for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke    an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.       Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data    on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are \\\"similar in    many ways,\\\" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law    stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish    the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that \\\"all    else is equal\\\" among things being compared. *     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look  *  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime *  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage *  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle *  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent. *  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the *  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half- *  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown *  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out. *     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is *  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates *  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide *  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver. *  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due *  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks, *  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics *  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison *  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial *  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle *  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain *  in either city.       Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the    cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority     groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in \\\"gun availability\\\"    (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not    matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why    blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed    in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,    do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)       Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between    Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have     anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol     abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city    of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the     Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the    United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian    percentage?       The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many    ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent    more detailed analysis, nearly any of these \\\"many ways\\\" might explain part    or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such    as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal. *     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide *  result in a \\\"complex picture.\\\"  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing *  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They *  also acknowledge that \\\"socio-economic status is probably an important *  confounding factor in our comparison,\\\" remarking further that \\\"blacks    *  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of *  Vancouver's population.\\\"  Given the evidence presented in the article, *  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle *  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial *  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility, *  since \\\"detailed information about household incomes according to race *  is not available for Vancouver.\\\"       The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in     gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple    example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms    of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one     would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.    Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce     crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into    account?  In this example, the \\\"hidden variable\\\" is city size: Guns are    more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city    problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the    appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very    seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities    for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,    and their results are impossible to interpret.       In the editorial \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science\\\" accompanying    the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the    authors for applying \\\"scientific methods\\\" to a problem of grave public    heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from    nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate    plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them    out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are    little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this    study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical    identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--    is cause for further concern.

In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean an \\\"air core resonant transformer\\\". The TV flyback version Tesla coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called \\\"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit\\\" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors, which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat, gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and telegraph for communication.

In sum, Ezekiel prophesied that the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of people living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.  This doesn't bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used differently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes happens that someone says \\\"My grandson is the cutest baby!\\\" and then turns around and sees the granddaughter and says \\\"Oh!  Isn't she the cutest thing!?\\\"  This person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the world according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for first.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very object-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people, nobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is often at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly literally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me, it is not.   Turning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from John E King:   No, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from Ezekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say \\\"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff like that.\\\"  You would read \\\"I will make you a bare rock\\\" and \\\"You will never be rebuilt\\\", and you'd conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way to get from `fishing nets' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large population' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.  In other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the prophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal reading, they could read this passage and conclude \\\"medium-size city\\\".  You seem to feel that \\\"Never be rebuilt\\\" means \\\"be rebuilt\\\" -- maybe so, but it is hardly a `clear implication'.     Well, no.  That's only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I'm from.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington resigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but it's at least a two-horse town.  But supposing 22,000 people is a \\\"small town\\\" -- it's still 22,000 people MORE than Ezekiel predicted.   And you've said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel predicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their valuables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29 Ezekiel even quotes God as saying \\\"he and his army got no reward from the campaign he led against Tyre.\\\"  Let's ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26. Ezekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says that N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.  Regardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before the place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.   *  This post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability to rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.  For example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26 by pulling some \\\"clear implications\\\" out of hat.  When Ezekiel said that N. would \\\"demolish your towers\\\", that clearly implied that the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers used to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would \\\"demolish your fine houses and throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea\\\", that clearly implied that N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N. would \\\"build a ramp up to your walls\\\", that clearly implies that N. would spend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the walls.  See?  A few \\\"clear implications\\\" that are totally contrary to the text, and you can reconcile anything you want. \",\"No it's not.  If you would have read my other post I was accurate.

The original article has reappeared, so:      The President today announced a new initiative that will bring     the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary     program to improve the security and privacy of telephone     communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law     enforcement.  Hmm, telephone communications could indeed include end-to-end encryption on ordinary landlines.      The initiative will involve the creation of new products to     accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure     telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  But the next paragraph says telecoms networks and wireless communications links.  OK, it's far from clear exactly what Cripple (what an apposite anagram) will be applied to, but the reason Joe Public wants secure comms is to stop people listening in to his cellular or cordless phones (and he wouldn't even be bothered about that were it not for Wingnut and Squidqy's misfortunes).  Yes, Cripple *might* be for end-to-end encyption, dropping to clear when the other end doesn't have Cripple.  But then a cordless-to-ordinary conversation would be in clear leaving the cordless end just as vulnerable as at present.  Nope, I suspect that Cripple will only be used on radio links.  OK, it's possible `telecommunications networks' could mean `ordinary phone lines', but I'm betting it means the microwave links used by the telcos.  My apologies if I'm wrong, particularly if the turgid Press Release makes it clear that I'm wrong and I missed it, but as far as I can see it was full of obfuscation, and anyone expecting end-to-end encryption is in for a surprise (IMHO).

Does anybody know of a company who makes fiberglass parts for Regals ??     Thanks in advance, \",\" Yep, that's pretty much it. I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the Jewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between YHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral Code to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries fall, though.  As I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was required, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that the Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of the required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).  The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between Man and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate anything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).   The trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the \\\"created in His image\\\" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and have still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if one wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors unashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about Jesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives by his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians. Revelation aside, one can only \\\"know\\\" Christ second-hand or worse.  This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way initially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible to interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where Faith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.   No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple moral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral code. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told the child that it is \\\"wrong\\\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in the pub or bar (where there are no children). The \\\"wrongness\\\" here is if the child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \\\"inappropriate\\\" to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of animals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that he is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but you get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive as absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.

Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started  with a solid single to right, moved to second on \\\"Bob\\\" Kelly's infield sneaker down the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a  rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.  Cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only  given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double by Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after Joe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who  argued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by \\\"drawing the line\\\" (really, he should know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting tossed.  The Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must  have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's single, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell and turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Branson failed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:  Saberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly: Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended. (Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)  The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin's ground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back singles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long fly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but third base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was hung out to dry killing the Reds rally.  Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner on second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game in late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on Dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla ended up walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a  week, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went to Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings work, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bit surprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.  The Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory today.

That is, we  observe in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced  by a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be  its own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.  God, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject  to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.  As a supernatural being,  God's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence  of a physical, natural cosmos does.  Thus, those who believe in the  supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused  phenomena such as the eternal God, whereas those who deny the existence of the  supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very  nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence.  This is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but I just wanted  to clarify some important differences between the supernatural (God) and the  natural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being  interchangeable.\",\"  Hmmm..

You are correct about 'majority.'  Somewhere between 1 out of three and  one out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent  assault.  The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems like heart attack and stroke.  'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1,000,000 Americans using firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some may have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in  using firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population. (Yes, I know that is a REAL rough estimate.  We're closer to 270 million now,  but many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage if anything is low.)  At any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred  to as 'tiny' minorities, so I don't see how the other part of the group  can be referred to as the 'vast' majority.  A little more work might  support a 'simple' majority of Americans never use, own or display a firearm.  Certainly when you are talking about OWNERSHIP you are wrong.  Nearly half of your fellow citizens own one or more firearms.     Please provide a list of other means that are as effective.  Then you might  convince your local police departments to switch.

They aren't designed, they evolved.  And, much as it discomforts us, in humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and cranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do. Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea: my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great- grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife had each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great- grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous farmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of childbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota, contain quite a few gravestones like \\\"Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and baby, May 6, 1853.\\\"   More like one in ten.  And the consequences can be devastating; I have direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth.   It isn't always fatal.  But it is often fatal, when it happens out of reach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.  Clearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine design); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.     My, aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack in months!  I can practically see your mouth foam.  We're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  Although I can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked them up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks. I wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly indicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting until an emergency to give in.  And bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions. We talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main decisions were really hers.   I don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that a first-time mother should have her baby at home.   But people should bother to find out the relative risks.  My wife was unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings. In view of the intensity of the birth experience, I doubt surroundings have much importance anyway.  Somehow the values you're advocating seem all lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious permanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all, an esthetic consideration.\",\"  OK, the Mets and O's are good examples, but what about the '90 Reds?

The Post says O'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I listened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connor talked about how the White House wants three options, sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC, modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch Core [\\\"wingless Orbiter\\\"] @ JSC. Later, in response to a reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a \\\"moderate\\\" cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not the \\\"high cost\\\" option as Sawyer wrote).  The article goes on to describe the other two options as \\\"one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure.\\\"\",\"    Well, I think that most Christians believe that your conciousness will somehow continue on after your 'physical' death, which contradicts what most atheists (myself included) believe, namely that your conciousness, being contained in your brain, dies when your brain dies.

Neil Smith                     LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE  [AUTHOR'S NOTE:  \\\"Adrian\\\" -- name changed to protect the guilty --  and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with  the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]  Dear Adrian:    I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to  your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and  generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist  mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back  with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present  now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the  future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.    There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger  of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan.  10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition,  shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic  rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll  limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent  with your note.    First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Second, publication of some latter-day \\\"scientific study\\\" doesn't  alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my  interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.    Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Fourth, as often happens with these things, the \\\"study\\\" doesn't  support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions  anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older  body of lies, omissions, and distortions.    Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on  countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND  BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this  present \\\"study\\\" dubious, to say the least.    Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat  (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you  should be better aware than most people how \\\"progress\\\" -- in  designing \\\"studies\\\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our  ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree  on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30  years to create \\\"studies\\\" \\\"proving\\\" that pornography causes crime.   More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s  clearly indicate the contrary.    Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Tenth, another reason to doubt all such \\\"studies\\\" is that human  behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The  attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the  resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.    Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Twelfth, the \\\"study\\\" is also worthless because it incorporates  figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but  basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social  benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a  criminal offense.    Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials  quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are  many), are correct in this instance:  the \\\"study\\\" is meaningless  because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    And because of that, Adrian, even if the \\\"study\\\" were valid, it  wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that  anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however,  whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's  permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists  themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed  people to go out and buy their first gun \\\"while they still can\\\".   Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the \\\"shooting fraternity\\\"  viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate,  ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in  the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys,  and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we  probably manufacture at least that many every year.  The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly  aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what  their real motives are.    Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way,  it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic;  the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the  self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing  this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a  quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \\\"half life\\\"  of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna  be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.  As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law  provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I  will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is  that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands  -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can  only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given  both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics  and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.    So what's the point?    L.

I'm sure we can uncover a few extremist loonies who are Catholic -- the anti-abortion movement in the USA seems to have a few hard cases in it, for example.   I have to agree Matthew with this; I have certainly encountered a lot of anti-Catholic-religion propaganda & emotion (& some bigotry) from members of certain religious groups here.  They also practice their missionary work with zeal among Catholics in the United States, but to someone who is or was raised Catholic such rhetoric is pretty off-putting.  It may work better in an environment where there's a lot of popular anti-clericalism.  Follow-ups set elsewhere, this no longer seems very relevant to Celtic issues to me.\",\" Still mastering the language, eh?

Could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of  Israel right after it was formed.     No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity. Palestinians are no exception. Perhaps you heard about anti-trust in the business world.  Since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law says that, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of investing, you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly, the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate. They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.  The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic / multi-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours was no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair market value, etc... They did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist myself, but this one is hard to dismiss).     Again Adam, the devil is in the details. I don't want to get on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its OK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest. Because 100 is a nice number that you can devide by 10, 100 and besides, it has an integer square root.    Do you actually believe this? My experience tells me that every palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home, in Palestine. Besides they often refer to their exodus as an escape from hell (so to speak). I know none that agrees with you. Did you sample their opinions? I know you don't care, just being rethorical.     Don't get me wrong. I beleive that Israel is democratic within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews). Israel probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic cleansing Serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the international community, or make the best out of a no win condition: show the world how good Israel is towards the 'bad' arabs. Personaly, I've never heard anything about the arab community in Isreal. Except that they're there.  So yes, they're there. But as a community with history and roots, its dead.       I stand corrected. I meant that the jewish culture was not predominant in Palestine in recent history. I have no problem with Jerusalem having a jewish character if it were predominantly Jewish. So there. what to make of the rest Palestine?    --  Sam Zbib                                         Bell-Northern Research ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Bitnet/Internet: zbib@bnr.ca                    VOICE:  (613) 763-5889                                                 FAX:    (613) 763-2626 Surface Mail: Stop 162, P.O.Box 3511, Station C, Ottawa, Canada, K1Y 4H7\",\" I've sent the article.

I thought I would post an article I found in the Saturday, April 17, 1993 Toronto Star:                    'CLIPPER CHIP' to protect privacy     Washington (REUTER) - President Bill CLinton announced yesterday a plan to plant a new \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" in every government telephone and computer line to prevent eavesdropping.     Eventually the chips, developed by the government's National Institute for Standards and Technology, would be used by commercial and private electronics communication users.     The White House said that to assure privacy, each device containing the encryption devices would be assigned two unique \\\"keys\\\" - numbers that will be needed by government agencies to decode messages.     The attorney-general has been assigned the task of arranging that the keys are deposited in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases. Access to them would be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap, the White House said in a statement.                                -30-    Dan McKinnon\",\" Acorn Replay running on a 25MHz ARM 3 processor (the ARM 3 is about 20% slower than the ARM 6) does this in software (off a standard CD-ROM). 16 bit colour at about the same resolution (so what if the computer only has 8 bit colour support, real-time dithering too...). The 3D0/O is supposed to have a couple of DSPs - the ARM being used for housekeeping.   A 25MHz ARM 6xx should clock around 20 ARM MIPS, say 18 flat out. Depends really on the surrounding system and whether you are talking ARM6x or ARM6xx (the latter has a cache, and so is essential to run at this kind of speed with slower memory).  I'll stop saying things there 'cos I'll hopefully be working for ARM after graduation...

Background of the problem:  I have a rectangular mesh in the uv domain, i.e  the mesh is a   mapping of a 3d Bezier patch into 2d. The area in this domain  which is inside a trimming loop had to be rendered. The trimming  loop is a set of 2d Bezier curve segments.  For the sake of notation: the mesh is made up of cells.   My problem is this :  The trimming area has to be split up into individual smaller  cells bounded by the trimming curve segments. If a cell  is wholly inside the area...then it is output as a whole ,  else it is trivially rejected.    Does any body know how thiss can be done, or is there any algo.   somewhere for doing this.

While running the MS Quick C compiler in a DOS window under Windows 3.1  this evening, I got a \\\"program has violated system integrity... close all  applications, exit windows and restart your computer\\\" error.  I started to do this when I immediately got a \\\"Serious disk error\\\" message from Windows.  \\\"hit return to retry\\\".  I did that about 5 times and then rebooted to find that quite a few files have been corrupted somehow. (I am including the chkdsk output below.)  Questions:  1)  Is there an easy way to restore everything to working order? What might be some better approaches?  2)  What might have caused this?  Does the SMARTDRV cache make me more vulnerable?  (I'm suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they cache data writing.)  The straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the /f option to  fix the disk and then it looks like I would probably have to reinstall Windows and a few other things.

The first part of the plan is to begin a  comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues  such as export controls which have effectively denied most people  easy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues  posed by new technology.         However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has  already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before  any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the  Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone  equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed  by the National Security Agency. The so-called \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is an  80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into  chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow  agents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over  law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The  encryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be  available to any manufacturer for incorporation into their  communications products.         This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .         First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution  before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper chip may  not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may  have better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the  government as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets  based on open standards.         Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested.  Yet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm  classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public  and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a  standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.           Third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed  system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and  law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored  publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the  safety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive  individual's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal  inquiries?           In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the  importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into  digital privacy and security.  However, the \\\"Clipper chip\\\" solution  ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before  the discussion even begins.  DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:  ESCROW  The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of  whom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid  warrant, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts  over to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General  will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the  Administration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal  agency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental  organization.  But, there is no agreement on the identity of the agents  yet.  Key registration would be done by the manufacturer of the  communications device.  A key is tied to the device, not to the person  using it.  CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS  The Administration claims that there are no back door means by  which the government or others could break the code without  securing keys from the escrow agents and that the President will  be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order  to prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for  an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security  arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results  of the investigation would then be made public.  GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER  In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government  believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big  customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service,  VP Al Gore, and maybe even the President.   FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:  Jerry Berman, Executive Director Daniel J.

What bit depths are accelerated, all or just 24 bit? I've heard that some applications actually run *slower* with this card if they write directly to the screen (or something like that). Is this a frequent problem? How much slower is it?  4) Didn't I read (when System 7 first came out) that the card was incompatible? If so, how was this corrected (Finder patch, some INIT, or other)?

Thanks a lot for you input. Rick \",\" In the Bible, there are a lot of instances where God speaks to people, where a person just \\\"came to know\\\" some piece of information, where a person walks off into the desert for \\\"40 days\\\", etc. With all of God's power He certainly can do whatever He wants when He wants it. The Bible \\\"ends\\\" with the book of Revelations. But does God's reign end there ? No. So who can say for sure that God's messages are either no longer happening or still happening ?  I can now hear the clamor for proof. 8-) With the cold response I've gotten from the past from this group, it's very hard to get the point across. I'll only go over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look at documents stored somewhere. I've cited the uncorrupted bodies of saints before. They're still there. 8-) The apparitions at Fatima, Portugal culminated in a miracle specifically granted to show God's existence. That was the spinning/descending of the sun. It was seen in several countries. That event is \\\"approved\\\" by the Pope. Currently, images of Mary in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Philippines, Africa are showing tears (natural or blood). These are still under investigation by the Church. But realize that investigations take decades to finish. And if the message is Christ will come in ten days, that's a bit too late, isn't it 8-). Other events under investigation are inner locutions (\\\"coming to know\\\"), stigmata (the person exhibits Christ's wounds. And they don't heal. And doctor's don't know why). Non-believers are welcome to pore through documents, I'm sure.  This stuff is not like Koresh. Or Oral Roberts (give me $5M or God will call me home). It's free. Find out why they're happening (as we ourselves are studying why). If anybody can figure this out, tell us ! You can be of any religion. If you have the resources, go to one of the countries I mentioned. These are not \\\"members only\\\" events. God and Mary invites  everybody.  So in conclusion (finally) ... We RC's believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary. We are scared to death sometimes although we're told not to. There are more proofs and events. And that is why \\\"not everything is in the Bible\\\". Although in a lot of the apparitions, we are told to read the Bible.  As far as the Protestant vs. Catholics issue is concerned... In the end, God's churches will unite. I'm not sure how. I have some idea. But the point is we shouldn't worry about the \\\"versus\\\" part. Just do God's work. That's all that matters. Unity will come.  BTW, I'm just a plain person. I'm not the Pope's spokesperson.

A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea()  (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles \\\"regular\\\" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a \\\"proper\\\" way to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is guaranteed to be mapped.  The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow \\\"tickle\\\" the Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.\",\"   I HOPE THAT YOU ARE IN THE WAY OF THE NOBLE FEDERAL ENFORCERS and are blown away accidently by the governments goons.

Cheers\",\" Since we are talking in theory and opinion, then I'll put in my $.02.  First, a rebuttle. Personally, I love under-dogs. Unlike  bandwagon jumpers, I abandon teams when they start winning. People that cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are afraid to be associated with something negative.   On this one point, I agree. The reason that people bash WASP's is  because they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top is going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top. If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people  for all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had  conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any better/worse than the whites did.  The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of the world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done (ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to the present generation who didn't participate in the crimes? Would it do  any good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stopped hundreds, even thousands, of years ago.   My opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let's change them. But don't blame me for what my ancestors did. It wouldn't settle anything anyway.   That's where you are dead wrong. You don't join up on a side just because they are winning. That makes you spineless. Winning, in high school and after high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't make you right. All the best causes in history were loosing causes (with only a couple exceptions). Winning only makes a difference to other people, not to yourself. And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care how you appear (ie. a Winner).   If you can't beat them, fight them every inch of the way.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \\\"At that moment the bottom fell out of Authur's mind.

I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed seperately on my pay stub.  While I'm not the only Canadian who favours lower taxes and cutbacks in spending, health insurance isn't on the table.  See our polls ... A better one might be the July 1st polls conducted for Macleans (our major English newsmagazine) by Decima Research ... Decima president Allen Gregg is considered one of the world's top poll researchers, and Mulroney's Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in the face of impossible election situations.  I haven't had a chance to see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had shown satisfaction at 97% and switching to an American all-private system had support within statistical noise.  The Decima polls are considered definitive.  Even the new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \\\"libertarian\\\" faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these).  Personally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used in Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in a nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a lot on values in those societies different from the U.S.  The basic health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.  Plenty of room is left for expenditure of private funds as extra insurance or as   Please explain this one, hopefully in a way that Canadian readers besides myself can understand and concur ...  gld\",\"   As applied to servers, the first three are fuzzy terms.  \\\"multi-headed\\\" tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg, a Sun with a cg4 display).  \\\"multi-screen\\\" and \\\"multi-display\\\" would, if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning of \\\"multi-display\\\" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and pointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing \\\"multi-screen\\\" would: a system that provides multiple Screens.  \\\"zaphod\\\" is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the screen.   There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a limit of 65535 Displays per machine, but this is not a limitation inherent to X.

Bingo - now the question is, does the Glock's qualify?  Let's see the evidence that Kratz uses.   But first an aside.  Having an air gun proves nothing.  Moreover, my comments are based on what Kratz writes.  He's free to argue that he babbles in text but actually knows something off-line.   Harder than what?  I note that almost all revolvers work the same way, so it can't be \\\"harder than revolvers\\\".   Sure they can.  (Moreover, we know now that Kratz' sample is unrepresentative.)  We can look at the reasoning.  It is basically \\\"these Glocks are dangerous because they're not like my 1911/S&W third generation.\\\"  Part of that is true, but since those same people don't claim that revolvers, which share the relevant property, are dangerous, we see that the argument fails.

They cut off the first half hour of coverage by playing David Brinkley at 12:30 instead of an earlier time slot. I don't even understand their problem.

And if they showed the remaining 2.5 hours of the game, would it hurt to play David Brinkley at its regular time? They dont have any decent programming before noon anyway.

I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans, even if the team sucks.  But this is short term only; I still do not think the attendance increase  will last, unless the team is a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kicking one.  Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support them.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you'd have knee surgery for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.     Ok.  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book.    You can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that it wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e. a winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And before anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back and read from where this thread started...  It might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly found an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it \\\"gee, Mario Lemieux is amazing, I'll go watch him play\\\", or was it \\\"gee, now we've got a *kick* *ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play\\\".  I think it was the latter.   I don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don't go to the games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket holders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings initial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source) and corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.    Whether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that since Gretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim that McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler dynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like McNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the Forum even if the tickets were sold.   For the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they make people around them better.   Well, at least we are in full agreement here!   So are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...>   Yes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of reasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people showing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you think that if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that case the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without Selanne.\",\"(References: deleted to move this to a new thread)    \\\"To put it as simply as possible: *I am not a Muslim*.[...] I do not  accept the charge of apostacy, because I have never in my adult life  affirmed any belief, and what one has not affirmed one can not be  said to have apostasized from.

Lau Hon-Wah\",\" Someone tell me there's a :-) hidden here somewhere... ??? --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David Rex Wood -- davewood@cs.colorado.edu -- University of Colorado at Boulder\",\" : Regardless of people's hidden motivations, the stated reasons for many : wars include religion.  Of course you can always claim that the REAL : reason was economics, politics, ethnic strife, or whatever.  But the : fact remains that the justification for many wars has been to conquer : the heathens.  : If you want to say, for instance, that economics was the chief cause : of the Crusades, you could certainly make that point.  But someone : could come along and demonstrate that it was REALLY something else, in : the same manner you show that it was REALLY not religion.  You could : in this manner eliminate all possible causes for the Crusades. :           Scott,  I don't have to make outrageous claims about religion's affecting and effecting history, for the purpsoe of a.a, all I have to do point out that many claims made here are wrong and do nothing to validate atheism. At no time have I made any statement that religion was the sole cause of anything, what I have done is point out that those who do make that kind of claim are mistaken, usually deliberately.   To credit religion with the awesome power to dominate history is to misunderstand human nature, the function of religion and of course, history. I believe that those who distort history in this way know exaclty what they're doing, and do it only for affect.\",\"   Hey Patrick, the Montana Magic played in Billings, not Great Falls...

Although I think the original quote is plain silly, you made it sound as if it is coming from a neo-nazi youth. For example, Turks talk of a \\\"motherland\\\" not a Germanic \\\"fatherland\\\". Why \\\"filth\\\" instead of \\\"dirt\\\"? The indeterminacy of translation is a well-known problem [1] so one may have to \\\"fudge\\\", but with some care of course.

Dan, your view of many groups appears correct from my point of view. However, I have found a group which is truly meeting requirements laid down by the Bible on what it means to be a disciple of Jesus.  I have no clue where wwc is, but please mail me.  I'd really like to get you in touch with them.  [insert deletion of ranting about other religions which obviously has gone off-center of Dan's original context]  Dan, I'm familiar with this one.  You've got a point, though.  There are some who don't want to turn over everything and be a disciple, some have no clue about it because they've not been taught, some have done exactly that and turned over everything to follow Jesus, some are blocked by difficult doctrine taught by uncaring Pharisees and teachers of the law. However, Jesus pointed out what it takes to follow him and to be his disciple in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33.  My question is:  why do people ignore the command and treat it as optional?  I certainly don't have an answer to this.  [insert deletion]   My parents had nothing to do with it.  God had and has everything to do with it.  As for these attacking responses, I must say that I disagree with your tone and what appears to be some very judgmental statements (possibly to the point of slander) when talking about people, not what they do.  Please, if you have a response, state it instead of flying off the handle on some discourse which may have nothing truly to do with what is being discussed.

NHL teams can't afford to import role players from Europe, they pick the stars but will continue to build their teams around local players.  I'd *LOVE* to see a European NHL division but can't see it happen for some time. There's simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several \\\"crucial\\\" markets like Germany, Italy and France while Sweden and Finland probably can't afford to shell out $20-$30 for tickets the way American/Canadian fans do. Call it \\\"the Minnesota North Stars\\\" effect: Scandinavians do love hockey but we prefer to watch local, inexpensive hockey to the NHL. The National Hockey League should love the idea, though. Pan-European TV channels such as Eurosport could bring in the millions the American networks likely never will pay.\",\"{I sent in something on this before but I believe it got lost in the weekend accident the moderator described.  This is an improved version anyway so no loss the first time.  HL}  The standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents  is probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, \\\"Hermeneutrik und  Kritik,\\\" _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of _Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Noerdlingen: Beck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The  Prophetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 (SLC:  Deseret Book, 1989). (If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibley describes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little knowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subject and the reader.)  Nibley's extract from Blass's work is in the form of \\\"rules for forgers.\\\"  It makes interesting reading.  I confess that I have not read Blass's work, only Nibley's extract thereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required and as far as I know there is no English translation available.  However, I believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that  any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one  would expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not  be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to  determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and  culture or is a later forgery.  Actually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:  1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For example the Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientific means to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found with them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual physical objects.  2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the copy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find a document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something from centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several generations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still  be tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannot expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so we must confine our testing to the text itself.  It is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if the document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date the document and identify its culture of origin.  For example I've heard of a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king in what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn up scholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the holograph).  They could check the language, content and writing style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a Palestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results were positive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually wrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but (barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for  comparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way to determine who the actual author was.  As I say, I'm no expert on Blas's work.  I do remember some of the tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.   Specifically we might ask:  1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradict itself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to  maintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The  longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency. For this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.  2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time? Again a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the writing is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be able to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuous things which someone from that culture would get right without even thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous  and trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.  3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speech etc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that  seem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book?   If so do they fit in with the culture?  Of course there are complications if the document has been translated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language when he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the culture claimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems and reduce certainty to be sure but don't necessarily prove forgery.  These tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work  with) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the  historian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to  ask are, \\\"Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we  know about the culture of claimed origin?\\\"  If there are things  which don't fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due to our lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really  significant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture.\",\"Cathy Smith posting for L. Neil Smith  Dear Bill --   Very, VERY good -- you made my whole day with this post. Thanks a lot.  L. Neil Smith\",\" ...\",\"Hey!? What happened to the solar sail race that was supposed to be for Columbus+500?\",\"  It certainly is multi-user. What I have seen from the March Beta is that it doesn't yet come with the stuff which exploits multi-user features. I remember somebody from MS stating that it doesn't allow two users share one GUI. My interpretation of this was that one user per console but all the networking and RPC based stuff you want.   I believe ftp and rlogin deamons for NT systems will come from third party. Somebody already has a Beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the net. There is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like csh on Unix for remote logins.   In general I liked NT when I checked it out. It slow compared to Win3.1 (just like any other real OS). The beta version, although being slow, botts up much faster than my SUN workstation. Windows subsystems also start up a lot faster than X windows. I believe Bill Gates was right when he stated that NT was not for everybody. After playing around with it for a while I was convinced. If I owned a busines using a \\\"business computer\\\" from IBM or some other established vendor, I would consider moving to NT platform because it would provide a much cheaper solution (If you are running SQL servers etc.). It provides the robustness such an application requires.   On the other hand if you like your DOS games, more or less forget about NT. You can always boot to DOS  but in general that defeats the purpose of using NT. Most of NT's features are visible in a networked environment and in such an environment you can't reboot your machine at will. For personal use, I would rather wait for the Win32 based Windows release (whatever you name it) than jump to NT bandwagon. I expect most applications will keep on using Win16 until Win32 becomes widely available.  \",\" It means that the EFF's public stance is complicated with issues irrelevant to the encryption issue per se.

Of course you never read Arab media,  I read Arab, ISRAELI (Jer. Post, and this network is more than enough) and Western (American, French, and British) reports and I can say that if we give Israel -10 and Arabs +10 on the bias scale (of course you can switch the polarities) Israeli newspapers will get either a -9 or -10, American leading  newspapers and TV news range from -6 to -10 (yes there are some that are more Israelis than Israelis) The Montreal suburban (a local free newspaper) probably is closer to Kahane's views than some Israeli right wing newspapers, British range from 0 (neutral) to -10, French (that Iknow of, of course) range from +2 (Afro-french magazines) to -10, Arab official media range from 0 to -5 (Egyptian)  to +9 in SA. Why no +10? Because they do not want to overdo it and stir people against Israel and therefore against them since  they are doing nothing.     the average bias of what you read would be probably around -9, while that of the average American would be the same if they do not read or read the new-york times and similar News-makers, and -8 if they read some other RELATIVELY less biased newspapers.\",\"1993 World Championships in Germany:  ====================================     Group A standings (Munich)          Group B standings (Dortmund)    --------------------------          ----------------------------                GP  W T L GF-GA +/- P                  GP  W T L GF-GA +/- P     Canada      2  2 0 0  6-1  +5  4    Czech republic 2  1 1 0  6-1  +5  3    Russia      2  1 1 0  6-4  +2  3    Finland        2  1 1 0  3-1  +2  3    Italy       2  1 1 0  3-2  +1  3    Germany        2  1 0 1  6-5  +1  2    Sweden      2  1 0 1  2-4  -2  2    USA            2  0 2 0  2-2   0  2    --------------------------------    -----------------------------------    Austria     2  0 0 2  2-5  -3  0    France         1  0 0 1  0-2  -2  0    Switzerland 2  0 0 2  0-3  -3  0    Norway         1  0 0 1  0-6  -6  0     April 18:  Italy - Russia        2-2       Norway - Germany          0-6             Sweden - Austria      1-0       USA - Czech republic      1-1   April 19:  Canada - Switzerland  2-0             Russia - Austria      4-2       Finland - France          2-0   April 20:  Sweden - Canada       1-4       Czech republic - Germany  5-0             Switzerland - Italy   0-1       Finland - USA             1-1   April 21:                                  Germany - France  15:30             Italy - Sweden                  Czech republic - Norway 20:00   April 22:  Switzerland - Russia            USA - France  15:30             Austria - Canada                Norway - Finland  20:00   April 23:  Switzerland - Austria           Germany - Finland  20:00   April 24:  Russia - Sweden                 Czech republic - France 15:30             Canada - Italy                  USA - Norway  20:00   April 25:  Sweden - Switzerland            Finland- Czech republic   15:30             Russia - Canada                 Germany - USA  20:00   April 26:  Austria - Italy                 France - Norway  20:00     PLAYOFFS:  =========   April 27: Quarterfinals   A #2 - B #3      15:30   A #3 - B #2      20:00   April 28: Quarterfinals   A #1 - B #4      15:30   A #4 - B #1      20:00   April 29: Relegation   A #5 - B #6      15:30   A #6 - B #5      20:00   April 30: Semifinals   A #1/B #4 - A #3/B #2     15:30   A #4/B #1 - A #2/B #3     20:00   May 1:  Relegation      14:30   Bronze medal game      19:00   May 2:  FINAL       15:00 \",\" The ??-jumper is used, if the other drive a conner cp3xxx.   no jumper set: drive is alone MA: drive is master SL: drive is slave  Michael\",\" Can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let's, for argument's sake, define \\\"rushed\\\" as brought up to the majors for more than a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below expectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing?  I'm serious; I tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but I'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are any.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can look up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).    Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was \\\"rushed\\\", although there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the next year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job, and has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was performed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being \\\"rushed\\\"; Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have been less likely to give up on him.  Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.  But does that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts performing up to expectations?\",\" Steve,  If the Israelis are stupid enough to \\\"allow\\\" a second \\\"Palestinian\\\" state (the first one is Jordon), then you will probably get your wish - and the Israelis would get what's coming to them.

Unfortunately, like all works from this time period and earlier, all that exists today are copies.    There are parts of books, scraps really, that date from around the mid second century (A.D. 130+).  There are some complete books, letters, etc. from the middle third century.  The first complete collection of the New Testament dates from the early 4th century (A.D. 325).  Throughout this period are writings of various early church fathers/leaders who quoted various scriptures in their writings.   If you mean that someone discovered thousands of \\\"Bibles\\\" which were all perfect copies dating from the last part of the 1st century...No!  If you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts (within the dates given above, but not letter perfect) and that the most probable text can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest original autographs (now lost) probably were written starting sometime shortly after A.D. 50, then yes.   From the original authors.  We call them Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Peter, Paul, James, and one other not identified.   As long as you make it.

A person who commits himself   to seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a person who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find  something to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one will gain with that attitude is folly.  Be careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages in the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even though they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not. Be assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such deep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied.  I will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, \\\"You will never be thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.\\\"   From King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):      \\\"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;      to search out a matter is the glory of kings.\\\"   Jesus says in John 6:44 & 55:     \\\"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\\\"   And in John 3:16:     \\\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,    that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal    life.\\\"   You are included in \\\"whosoever\\\".  And I also pray that the Father is drawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting to talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the making.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure stoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became on of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.  You see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because you could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack Christians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul, proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.  Or you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would  probably say to you: \\\"Satan would surely like to have you.\\\"  Why so? Because Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great moments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task he did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the faith to walk on water as Jesus did.  You asked \\\"Why not believe in Zeus?\\\"  Zeus didn't offer eternal life. You got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus. \",\"OK will some one out there tell me why / how DOS 5 can read (I havn't tried writing in case it breaks something) the Win/NT NTFS file system.

They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan- ger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the  physical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had  an awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas ornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this  went on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and  was in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into tears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .  Then someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I  want to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am  silent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling me, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the one whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place,  telling him, \\\"I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring  her corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse.\\\" He went and returned empty handed, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his  apartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were  walking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls.  There was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.  They started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I  went down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the apartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be  cowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the  doors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth,  opened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle  Sabir's son started to shout, \\\"Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!\\\" He  knocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma.  Aunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their  apartment. I didn't see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying delirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother. All of my family had gathered there.     At the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the apartment.  Later I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, \\\"Lyuda,  Karina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. If she recognizes  you, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful.\\\" It was as though her whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one  side, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her  cheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole microdistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. I said, \\\"Fine.\\\" Mamma was  afraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started  to cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the bed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye  that was intact, looked at me, and said, \\\"Who is it?\\\" But I could barely talk,  my whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say, but rather muttered something tender, something incomprehensible, but tender, \\\"My Karochka, my Karina, my  little golden one . . . \\\" She understood me.  Then Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips.  She started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn't  understand it. Then I made out, \\\"It hurts, I hurt all over.\\\" Her hair was  glued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her  forehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don't know how  to help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She's saying something to me, but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil  and paper and says, \\\"Write it down.\\\" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I  can't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me  something, but she couldn't. I say, \\\"Karina, just lie there a little while, then maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then.\\\" And then she says, \\\"Maybe it'll be too late.\\\" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn't control myself.  Then I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She  says, \\\"Lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this  damned house. They want to kill us, I know. They'll find us here, too. We need to call Urshan.\\\" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I  understood her every word. I ask, \\\"What's his number?\\\" Urshan Feyruzovich,  that's the head of the administration where she works. \\\"We have to call him.\\\"  But I didn't know his home number. I say, \\\"Karina, what's his number?\\\" She  says, \\\"I can't remember.\\\" I say, \\\"Who knows his number? Who can I call?\\\" She  says, \\\"I don't know anything, leave me alone.\\\"  I went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was  crying, too. I say, \\\"Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can  we call him? Who knows his telephone number?\\\" I tell Marina, \\\"Think, think,  who can we call to find out?\\\" She started calling; several people didn't  answer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and  found out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he  was at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can't talk normally. She says,  \\\"Lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and  tell them that they just can't do that.\\\" She still didn't know what was really going on. I said, \\\"It's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's  happening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single  Armenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised  that we managed to save ourselves. \\\"She says, \\\"Well, OK, if it's that serious  . . . \\\" And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up  and that I'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. \\\"OK,  fine, fine,\\\" she says, \\\"if you're afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back  I'll send him over.\\\"  We called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly  under Aunt Tanya's, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian's apartment. She  wasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed  everything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on trying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and  finally we get through. She says, \\\"Yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your  place now.\\\" He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening, either,  because he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep  with his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what  shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has  grown up daughters, they're almost my age.  The three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and went down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No,  first they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As soon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said that we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might have fractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the first floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around eleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I  saw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies . . . everything just like a war.  They carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical people from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older  Armenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud  she would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle  Arkady, I think, because someone said \\\"Arkady, get an injection ready,\\\" he  started to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But  when he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his  sixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and  started to cry: \\\"What have they done to you?!\\\" He was speaking Armenian. \\\"What have they done to you?!\\\" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and  she started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. \\\"I'll give you a shot.\\\"  Mamma tells him, \\\"I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what  are they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people, and you're just sitting here!\\\" Some teacups were standing on the table in  there. \\\"You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my  daughters! Look what they've turned them into!\\\" They gave her something to  drink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the doctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa  and Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina  out. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I  don't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: \\\"What's  the matter with you?\\\" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter in the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's. I said, \\\"I'm fine.\\\" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told  the doctor, \\\"You leave, let a woman examine her.\\\" A woman came, an  Azerbaijani, I believe, and said, \\\"What's wrong with you?\\\" I was wearing my  sister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When  she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would  be easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed her. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge  wound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said  something to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be  dressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital.  They put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me.  I raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't  know if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, \\\"Lie still, you mustn't move.\\\" When I was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed  very familiar to me. I shouted, \\\"Stop!\\\" One of the policemen turned and says,  \\\"What do you want?\\\" I say, \\\"Bring him to me, I want to look at him.\\\" They  brought him over and I said, \\\"That person was just in our apartment and he  just raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.\\\" They said,  \\\"Fine,\\\" but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were  taking him.  Then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were  sitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car  up closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, \\\"Sister . . . \\\" I don't  remember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they did to us. I asked him, \\\"Where are you from?\\\" He said that he was from Ufa.  Apparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I  learned that they suffered most of all. He says, \\\"OK, you're Armenians, they  didn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian,\\\" he says, \\\"what are they trying  to kill me for?\\\" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the  balcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw  two Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed  against the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him with his own club. The way he cried \\\"Mamma\\\" made my skin crawl. I don't know  what they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before  he attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the third or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was  Azerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they were throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with  someone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the  yard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that I realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.  They took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too  and said, \\\"I've been beaten too, help me.\\\" But they just ignored her. My  father went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault  that he'd been beaten, and says, \\\"My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have  probably broken my ribs. Please look at them.\\\" The doctor says, \\\"That's not my job.\\\" Urshan said, \\\"Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor,  I'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them  to his apartment.  Marina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the  doctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I  wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very surprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the Hippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy-- coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she, having examined Karina, said, \\\"No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like  they did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women. \\\"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she would certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same  story. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no  drugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soon found out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And they started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at  zoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from  seeing it.  They put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have  any serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their  place, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira  her daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And Ira was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed. When they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she  involuntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again. Her daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful  when I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, \\\"Do what you want with me, just leave my daughter alone.\\\" Well, they did what they  wanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I  would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It  was simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do  every day: steal, kill, rape . . .  Many are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts  explained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those  children would be grown, and then, as they put it, \\\"we'll come take the  pleasure out of their lives, those children.\\\" This was about the girls that would be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow  because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just as there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be  of some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the  victims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, that they would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they themselves said that.  And this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many  people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know  why their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before,  maybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and  they weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at  nothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with  Marina: \\\"Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over  there [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman  shouldn't see such things.\\\" So they were really quite sober . . .  So we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all  happened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several  hours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what happened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk- ing to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when he thought no one is listening: \\\"Listen,\\\" he'll say, \\\"what could I do? What could I do alone, how could I protect them?\\\" I don't know where to find the words, it's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen.  That's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of  course he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail of what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke together in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never present at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And when the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present.  On February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital. First they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city,  the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier.  There were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family  there. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They  were sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife  and Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying.  Then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard. There's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area. They took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide. The women were shouting. They explained to them: \\\"We want to hide you better because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.\\\"  We went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We had children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to  have their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful.  They kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you  could see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the  police precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is  surrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were  standing on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought  great psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't  just walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48, or those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost  family members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened  when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a single person, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must have already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret  room down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at one another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those  people, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that the end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the  hospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my  parents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should  attack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an  Armenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and  she wouldn't be able to take it.  Then soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people  climbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers. They all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We  calmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some  little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children to the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never  have occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people  do eat.  Then, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They  were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from  the courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a  different woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing,  and calling out: \\\"Oh, Rafik!,\\\" but when she heard about this such a rage came  over her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her  sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were  soldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash  him! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not  one of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from  doing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands,  muttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile appeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round was over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing  terribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the  creeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did  this the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She  went five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women,  \\\"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they  raped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though  nothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?\\\" She appealed to everyone, but no  one got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I  could barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so  many hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already after ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the  elderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time.  There was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking.  The situation was deplorable.  At eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen,  Azerbaijanis. They said, \\\"Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash up and put the children to bed.\\\" Now the women didn't want to leave this place,  either. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with  dogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, \\\"Oh, it's our little  family,\\\" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for  the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone spoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded machine guns in their hands, said, \\\"Grandmother, you mustn't approach me, I'm on guard.\\\" Our people would say, \\\"Oh, that's all right.\\\" They hugged them, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly moving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.  They took us up to the second floor and said, \\\"You can undress and sleep in  here. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city.\\\" This was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other places. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the SK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I  asked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me. I didn't know what was happening there. They told me, \\\"Don't worry, the Maternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest assured. I say, \\\"Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in there is capable of anything.\\\"  When I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had already been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi- tal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once we were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met  acquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who  hadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with  them, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had  come their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like  they had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people,  hungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of  course the stories and the talk were flying: \\\"Oh, I heard that they killed  him!\\\" \\\"What do you mean they killed him!\\\" \\\"He stayed at work!\\\" \\\"Do you know  what's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.  And then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very  well and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small  room, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night  talking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary  of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see  Bagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed  from outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask  him things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by  soldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with  the people. Apparently he had more important things to do.  Several hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, \\\"Lyudochka, find another  two or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs,  lists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people  who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.\\\" I  had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, \\\"Lyuda, your  Mamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are  alive and well and that you're here.\\\" I gave the lists to someone and asked  them to continue what I was doing and went off.  The list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian's father, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels Grigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the  name of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said  that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front of the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later  it turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had somehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for  Krasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that  in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored  missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3  All the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were  contained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple  of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, \\\"What's  going on?\\\" He said, \\\"Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels they are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev [Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to him, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it was one or fifty.\\\" They told him that the list had disappeared and they should ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over again. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26 was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because that's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26  people on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only  a half of those that were on the first list. He said, \\\"Lyuda, please, try to remember at least one more.\\\" But I couldn't remember anyone else. But there were more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy don't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people  whose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims of the Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many  people left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns in Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the  Krasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that  there are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical  Krestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk  cows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went  to help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering the city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the  Azerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there's more. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list  drawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course don't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to  publicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court,  they simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of them is the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No.  8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know  her name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in  Microdistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the  same landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding  the door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and  when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her  braid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because  they didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one  . . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore.  They transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived for days in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there  and I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina;  it was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could  already walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the  social work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said,  \\\"If it weren't for the work I would go insane.\\\" He and I put ourselves in gear and took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers  and free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything,  although we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been  dispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it  was free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by to see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly visible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.  On March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir Fedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered  only Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital. Mother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.  Shirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I  told him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and record everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind.  We didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the conditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor  quality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there  weren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a  curfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or  video cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that  we can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially  to draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw that the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to  Sumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with  Bibishev, I told him myself, \\\"Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two  months, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in those two days, I'll help you conduct the investigation.\\\"  He and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I gave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to her, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her- self. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x- rays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eat and drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we were in Baku already, the investigator told me, \\\"How long can you go on like  this? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're not taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this investigation through. We need you.\\\" Then I started eating, because in fact I was exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart- ment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement cells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in every prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of Sumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary  confinement.  Thus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma  identified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn't identify  anyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren't among the  photographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one  who went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the  loose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know  his first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his  sisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that  even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will  continue looking for him.  The 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various  plants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect. Mostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only one of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and Chemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga- tor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front of me \\\"I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash simply for keeping him out of Armenia,\\\" that is, to keep him from landing in a prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if the investigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even though we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological pressure--they say, \\\"Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in an Armenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of you in short order.\\\" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.  The investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire pogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then that I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was  in our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and  all the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned  them, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials from the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James  Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were  boiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had  been in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's  enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't even know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did  take worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out  slippers.  Of those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait.  Basically, the group that went seeking \\\"revenge\\\"--let's use their word for  it--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with  one of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that  black I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking part in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of  Tamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently arrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I  don't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an  Azerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know  nothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an  axe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and  threw them into the tub with water.  I remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You  know, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both  their hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey- eyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I  identified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born in the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How  did I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I  kept thinking, is that Rita or \\\"puma,\\\" which it would be if you read the word  as Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic \\\"T\\\" was the one  that looks like a Latin \\\"M.\\\" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind his back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to put in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and  told me that I was making a mistake, and called me \\\"dear sister.\\\" He said,  \\\"You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an  Armenian,\\\" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator  asked me, \\\"Lyuda, are you sure it was he?\\\" I told him, \\\"I'll tell you one more identifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The  name Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.\\\" He went rigid and became  pale. They told him, \\\"Put your hands on the table.\\\" He put his hands on the table with the palms up. I said, \\\"Now turn your hands over,\\\" but he didn't  turn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they  forced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently. But he insolently stuck to his story, \\\"No, I did not do anything, it wasn't  me.\\\" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his hand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew into a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out  of granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it.  Catching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked and the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and  back. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how,  but I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or  strangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the  microphone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his last name, and he says, \\\"Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . . \\\" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped.  They took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down,  because we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, \\\"You're  some actress! What a performance!\\\" I said, \\\"Tolya, honestly . . . \\\" Beforehand they would always tell me, \\\"Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if  nothing had happened to you.\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have any more strength or  emotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength  . . . I don't have the strength to do anything.\\\" And he says, \\\"Lyuda, how were you able to do that?\\\" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching the tape, I said, \\\"Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped  that high in gym class.\\\"  So you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of  the 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who  beat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.  At the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his  guilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among them were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said,  \\\"Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three o'clock.\\\" He said, \\\"No, I'm not coming.\\\" They told him, \\\"If you don't come  we'll kill you.\\\" He said, \\\"Alright, I'll come.\\\" And he went.  They also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He had also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a  motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him  out of his apartment and told him the same thing: \\\"Tomorrow we're going to get the Armenians. Be there.\\\" He said, \\\"No.\\\" They pulled a knife on him. He said,  \\\"I'm not going all the same.\\\" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed  him several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was in the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that  we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.  I'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he beat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he was very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for him, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning of Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our  apartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our  apartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I  don't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blacked out very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina because he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the courtyard, he remained in the apartment.  At one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her I learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't  have a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his third and, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work with bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.  The others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can't call them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying out someone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, \\\"I don't  understand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.\\\" But we know that they were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In the name of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam-- that's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do. Because I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about their level of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they work, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they  crowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were  promised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments. So off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, \\\"they  promised us apartments.\\\"  Among them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the heart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a  children's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at  the children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they  have they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or  grandparents. And he said, \\\"I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . how I ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my  own, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.\\\" And the whole time I kept repeating, \\\"Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife  right before your own eyes.\\\" He sat there and just wailed.  But that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a  marvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just  have to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his grandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how  to cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he  knew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed  himself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained.  That one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr  Gambarian was murdered. He came in and said, \\\"Let's go, enough, you've spilled enough blood here.\\\"  Maybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was  that they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya and her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They  liked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When  Karina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors  old me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to  the entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were  already at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came back and started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have  sustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older  woman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of  Karina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off. The woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands  and led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth,  he sees everything, and He won't forgive this.  There was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first  floor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a custom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them. But they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is  tantamount to trampling a woman's honor.  Now that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we  have gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these  events that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come  about? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that  without a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not  have happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis, let other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their  nations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are  a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for what they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they  threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done, to snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on February 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone  who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left for their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got as far away as their legs would carry them.  February 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came  into my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had  been a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for  a meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few  teachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or  seven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there  were a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the  evening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and  the crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the  microphone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the  driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani child off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had seen it himself..The crowd started to rage: \\\"Death to the Armenians! They must be killed!\\\" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because  people were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The  woman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians  cut her daughters' breasts off, and called, \\\"Sons, avenge my daughters!\\\" That  was enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the  direction of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.  We stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a  very nationalist speech. He said, \\\"Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!\\\" This  he repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him  stormily, whistling and shouting \\\"Karabagh!\\\" He said, \\\"Karabagh has been our  territory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my  heart?\\\" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. \\\"It's our  territory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated.  From time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from time immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years  the Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.\\\" By filth he meant  Armenians.  I heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely. Many people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with  the other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate, that in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our teachers said, \\\"Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's  spouting,\\\" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we  listened to the woman's speech.  Right then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the  subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of studies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I had considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to  obtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me, \\\"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If  they find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I  tell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?\\\" When he  said it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a  second time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already after eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered,  \\\"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until  twelve. Stay here.\\\" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in  kindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: \\\"I left my  children at the kindergarten.\\\" The director excused her. When she let her go I turned around, said, \\\"Good-bye,\\\" and left with the young teacher, the  Azerbaijani. I didn't see them after that.  When we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran nearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too  much for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed  off. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher  wouldn't say that I was an Armenian.  To make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at  the movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and again my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched  television as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last  day. That's how it all was.  At the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together, Zhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store  on Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she  doesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father  held the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the  ground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went  out on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the  entryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders  there. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the  moment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been  injured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor,  and their children: any way they could.   Where it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin,  Armen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims  what was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one  another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even  with muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and  their old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got  them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked  electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then  they took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an  Azerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director and told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to  escape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of  course, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only thing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The  Armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored  personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and led everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored  personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that  very moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves.  I heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big,  strong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a  strong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.  One of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking  for the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected,  people hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps  dead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went  with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found  Azerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and  put down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or  infection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the  neighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject  came up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the  basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor carried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing  as one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor  took his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything  seemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing  of ours he had managed to \\\"save.\\\"  Raya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended  themselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were Azerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some  reason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just  victims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too.  In the TV show \\\"Pozitsiya\\\" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that  the Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not  important, the truth will come out regardless.  So that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our  bravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the  years and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've  become, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.  On that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said that it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments received by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans  will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the  Procuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga- tion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on  the street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fear speaking our native tongue.

When Lemieux or Gilmour play their number one purpose is to score- defence is secondary- especially considering the line that plays against them is probably a defensive one.  That is why they are not Selke candidates.   Someone posted something about this assumption being lost in translation (it was a few months ago).  Whoever this was please repost it.   Gainey is the best defensive forward ever.  I stand by that assessment. He was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame.  Did you ever watch him play? He never made a technical error.  <Babbling deleted>   Who are these pundits??  Gilmour was good with St Louis- but he was not the best two-way player in the game when he was with them.

The design was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat ofuscated pattern into an EEPROM.  The idea was to make the circuit difficult to program arbitrary values into the EEPROM.  The secondary purpose, acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint of practicality, was to distributed the writes so as to avoid exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the EEPROM being used. The microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the Hall effect at a rate any higher than 110 MPH so as to make spoofing the reading by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable.  This was for an automobile that was not expected to ever exceed 110 MPH in operation.  The case, of course, might not be the same for your 1993 RX-7!  The ECM modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions under which cars have been operated.  Since steering angle and velocity data, etc is available it would not be difficult to collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the drivers' use of the car.  I am not aware of any manufacturer currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading out use data from the ECM.  While it could be a potential invasion of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your driving style, it could also provide valuable information from actual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars. I personally wouldn't mind the dealer collecting my driving demographics as long as it is done in an anonymous fashion.  \",\" DA] Armenia is involved in fighting with Azarbaijan.

The SUNDAY TIMES 8 March 1992  Morgues fill as Azeris head for all-out war  -------------------------------------------  Thomas Goltz, the first to report the massacre by Armenian soldiers in  the worst violence since the breakup of the Soviet Union, reports from  Agdam  ------  Khojaly used to be a barren town, with empty shops and treeless dirt  roads. Yet it was still home to thousands of people who, in happier  times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off  the map.  .......  As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of  Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt  that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been  the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke  apart.  .......  I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and  people were predicting their fate with grim resignation. Zumrut Ezoya,  a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the  town, called her community \\\"sitting ducks, ready to get shot\\\". She and  her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 26.  .......  \\\"The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages, one by one, and  the government does nothing.\\\" Balakisi Sakikov, 55, a father of five,  said. \\\"Next they will drive us out or kill us all,\\\" said Dilbar, his  wife. The couple, their three sons and three daughters were killed in  the assault, as were many other people I had spoken to.  ......  \\\"It was close to the Armenian lines we knew we would have to cross.  There was a road, and the first units of the column ran across then  all hell broke loose. Bullets were raining down from all sides. we had  just entered their trap.\\\"  The azeri defenders picked off one by one. Survivors say that Armenian  forces then began a pitiless slaughter, firing at anything moved in  the gullies. A video taken by an azeri cameraman, wailing and crying  as he filmed body after body, showed a grizzly trail of death leading  towards higher, forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge  from the Armenians.  \\\"The Armenians just shot and shot and shot,\\\" said Omar Veyselov, lying  in hospital in Agdam with sharapnel wounds. \\\"I saw my wife and  daughter fall right by me.\\\"  People wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the  loved ones. Some vented their fury on foreigners: \\\" Where is my  daughter, where is my son ?\\\" wailed a mother. \\\"Raped. Butchered. Lost.\\\"  Azerbaijan has said as many as 1,000 refugees were killed as they  tried to flee. The Armenians have denied this, saying the civilians  were caught in \\\"crossfire\\\".  .......  Source: The Times, 2 March 1992.  CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH  ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO  INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...  As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw  the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as  they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to  journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts  of the hills.  The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING  of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians  last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death  or missing...   Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter  as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there  was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer  ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We  swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon  under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.  We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round  again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a  valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung  round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired  repeated blasts.  Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting  had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in  fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter.  I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window,  its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on  \\\"our side\\\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a  search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.  Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two  M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed  flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second  crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains  and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters  were there to give covering fire if necessary.  The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet  armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani  official told us that there were now five former Soviet military  helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \\\"They have  signed contracts to fly for us,\\\" he said. The helicopter we engaged  in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian  pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.  We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an  heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer  white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four  corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an  Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies  on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back  towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before  the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.  Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the  civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were  covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor  mortis. They had been shot.  What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave,  and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY  DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

Madness.  /* Written  4:34 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */ /* ---------- \\\"From Israeli press. Madness.\\\" ---------- */ FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.  Paper: Zman Tel Aviv (Tel Aviv's time). Friday local Tel Aviv's paper, affiliated with Maariv.  Date: 19 February 1993  Journalist: Guy Ehrlich  Subject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan (Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate within the occupied territories.  Excerpts from the article:  \\\"A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as Arabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is that everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one way or another insane\\\".  A man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name is known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be called Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to depart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different from average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service. But in their souls, one can notice something completely different....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them. And they think that to most of their fellows from the Cherry it woundn't be easy either. Yet after they began to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking. The following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness.  (...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in which some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We called such soldiers H.I. 'Hit by the Intifada'. Under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common phenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I should talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On Fridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to until I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The keys of my father's car must be ready for in advance, so that I can go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don't want them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it instantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only there I become normal.(...)  (...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother. It was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how exactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began to laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh straight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov cocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as they deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with the effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I was delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the Arab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit him straight in his ass. We both felt that we'd pulled off something.  Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab, blood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: 'Shut up' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed straight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at something convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: 'All right, wait a moment'. I left him in order to take a look at another wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be saved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all this to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight into my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt I was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over her head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn't know what to say.  (...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a field. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend shot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the hill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it. We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two deer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully inspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We had hit'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too, so as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like beasts of prey. We couldn't explain what had happened to us. We were almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we felt the whole day very badly.  (...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in. This is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may be for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel Godlike of sorts.\\\"  (...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any security-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. 'Why shouldn't I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ? Why shouldn't I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver while being a mercenary in South Africa ?

In the early 80's with the fuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage than comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their 350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big mistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine could not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with these cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer -- DON\\\"T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.  Ask yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving, LOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper in the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them? Trailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines? No, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a 500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.  I own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine. Just keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline engine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that  when they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350 engine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about $2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long and gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine costs about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection pump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again, you never need a tune-up.  If you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal. Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.\",\"I have several books which I really wish to sell.

Was the crucification the will of God or a tragic mistake.  I believe it was a tragic mistake.  God's will can never be accomplished through the disbelief of man.  Jesus came to this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He desperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah.  If the crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this cup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men and women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes. Is Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucification was NOT the will of GOD.  God's will was that the Jewish people accept Jesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on the earth with Jesus as it's head. (Just like the Jewish people expected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what kind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very different world.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.  Men and women of that age could have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was on the earth.  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would have continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to live with GOD.  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to wait for Christ's return.  But when he returns will he be recognized and will he find faith on this earth.  Isn't it about time for his return.  It's been almost 2000 years.  Mike    And the two simplest refutations are these:  (1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament. I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded \\\"impact\\\" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event.  (2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.\",\"OK...I've heard rumors about this...I might have even seen it in a few places.

And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB, because it runs at 8 Mhz and 16 bits. Do people forget that the IDE was specifically designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen IDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all times it was a 16 bit standard, running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When you run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running it at 33 Mhz, it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever, none of them run at CPU speed.  The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to a caching controller. I suspect it would be much, much better to get a software disk cache instead, since you get write-caching as well.   I've seen some Fuji IDE drives going as high as 1G.\",\"There are actually only two of us.  I do Henry, Fred, Tommy and Mary.

Eric Thomas  \",\"One of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registration body is the ACLU.  I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU is essentially a group of auditors: they audit how people's civil liberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to get involved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good reason.  When I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the auditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a security point of view, but wouldn't tell us how to fix it.  I always figured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix the problem.  Then I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason. Auditors don't like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a bad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The auditee can say, \\\"Well, you told us this way would be OK.\\\"  It compromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor's job.  Taking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar. Suppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU's part, a key half gets away that shouldn't, and is used to deprive someone of her civil liberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court. But they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant and of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.  There are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one place where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed automatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum was kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and was brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.  I believe the difference between this situation and the key registration situation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll checks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again today, he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they can be destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are legit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could put the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU conflict of interest.  As always, my opinions are my own.\",\"Cyrix have released a 386 pin-conpatible 486 clone. Designed to upgrade old 16 & 20MHz 386's the chips are also clockdoubling.

I'm still not sure I know what you are trying to say.\",\" [stuff deleted]   Ah, clarification by obfuscation.  Actually, the words \\\"A well regulated Milita, being necessary to the security of a free state\\\" is a present participle, used as an adjective to modify 'militia', which is followed by the main clause of the sentence, the subject being 'the right', the verb 'shall'.  It asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for maintaining a milita.  The sentence doesn't restrict the right, or state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other than the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a right of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First, Fourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment. The existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the amendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the right to bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of a free state. In other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep and bear arms is UNCONDITIONAL.    The final word on liberties and rights should not belong \\\"to the many\\\".  That is why we have a Constitution.  Otherwise, a tyrrany of the majority can ensue from \\\"popular\\\" opinion, a concept which you should be familiar with from the Federalist papers.\",\": Having met Peter Kingston (of WBT) some years back, he struck me  : as an exemplery and dedicated Christian whose main concern was with : translation of the Word of God and the welfare of the people : group he was serving. : WBT literature is concerned mainly with providing Scripture : in minority languages.

To cover my arse, what I'm trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong, as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism (I wish!).  Whereas I _logically_ can only support the weak atheist position, in effect I am a strong atheist (and wish I could be a mathematical one).  To justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is faulty.  If I read the FAQ correctly, no argument for the existence of god (generic, as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever been found to be unassailable.  To me this is adequate evidence that the _real_god_ is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight), which in turn I accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.  I'm a little fuzzy on the edges, though, so opinions are welcome (but perhaps we should change the thread subject).\",\"    >>The info I am about to give is not a rumour, it's the truth.

Previously a MC68882RC25 was installed and everything was working perfectly.  Now the systems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for the presence/type of FPU.  When I reinstall an MC68882RC25 the system works fine, but with the XC68882 even at 25 MHz it does not work.  The designer of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe (470 Ohm) might help, but that didn't change anything.  Does anybody have some suggestions what I could do?  Does this look like a CPU-FPU communications problem or is the particular chip dead (it is a pull, not new)? Moreover, the place I bought it from is sending me an XC68882RC33.

Are there any MC68882RC33?\",\"  So, like, what do you do during those six months to be \\\"active?\\\" My town has a similar requirement, and it's rather stupid.  Before you can buy a handgun, you have to be an active member of a gun club. Well, how active can you be without a gun, chief?  Most gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental disorders would be a very good thing -- IF it couldn't be abused by the government.  But every time this is proposed, there is always some trapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you are perfectly qualified to own a gun.  And we oppose this.   Since the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US  is around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun owners, I'd think twice before using this analogy.  Besides, the problem is criminal use of guns, not accidents.  (There are about 500,000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year -- but only 1,400 accidents.)  I don't think it's necessary to spend a lot of energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one.  Just like the check, most gun owners feel positively about requiring safety courses -- IF they couldn't be abused by the government.  But  they already have!  One state doesn't hold the courses, another doesn't  fund them, a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence  to those with political connections.  Is this fair?   And how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets? How many are borrowed, stolen, smuggled, bought on the black market?   Some states allow ONLY open carry.  Some allow ONLY concealed carry. Some allow both.  Some allow both, but require licenses for concealed  carry.  All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage over another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good, then state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing. Which means that they really don't have any objective reasons for  these laws other than their preferences -- a bad way to govern.   (\\\"Hot-livered.\\\"  I LOVE that expression.  Here, we say \\\"hot-headed.\\\")   Typically, the only criminals who can affect the rights of ALL the other people are criminals in government offices.  The rest of our criminals affect the rights of only one or a few people at a time, and they do this during the commission of a crime.  POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts NO ONE else.  It is when they do something violent with that gun that the crime occurs.  Of course, it is a crime for a felon or ex-felon to possess a gun, but we don't feel it is right to treat common citizens who have lived good lives as if they were just \\\"pre-felons\\\" waiting to commit crimes.   I don't understand this sentence.   Life isn't fair.  I shouldn't need a fire extinguisher either, or flood and theft insurance, or to lock the doors of my house and car. But pining for a better world won't do anything to address what I have to do to live in this one.   None of ours, I'm sure.   Frankly, I'm not sure I know what good a driver's license does anyone, either.  The people who drive safely never use it, and the people who  drive drunk, drive without it!  However, a car is a good tool, but not one that protects my right to life. I rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely.   The question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally.  It's whether or not you think that ALL people should be forced to do as you do. I don't have any problem with someone who says they would never own a gun. I do have a problem with someone who says I should be prevented from owning one, too. -- \",\": > Not to pick on Mr. May in particular, of course, but isn't this : >kind of the domino theory?

It may have been their first production using live actors-- they were better known for their technophilic puppet shows, such as *Supercar*, *Stingray*, and *Thunderbirds*.  Later, they went on to do more live-action SF series: *UFO* and *Space: 1999*.  The astronomy was lousy, but the lifting-body spacecraft, VTOL airliners, and mighty Portugese launch complex were *wonderful* to look at.\",\"  In order of your questions, I oppose it, I oppose it, I oppose it and (Huh?  Wha?  Where did _that_ topic come from and what's it got to do with the discussion at hand? :-)  When I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes against different classes of people (and yes, I do consider laws which allow/mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the convict's attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit into that category), the category of classes I had in mind was that of the standard civil rights discussion -- classes based upon race, gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.  Having you ask about classes based upon one's _profession_ rather than one's personal characteristics caught me off guard, and I had to think out the question from scratch.  What I finally decided was that the law should not recognize such classes because to do so would be to formally and officially declare some people to be of more worth than others, and that would be anathema to the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law.  Last year, when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would have expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-plus crimes, including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not protected by that \\\"aura of deterrence,\\\" critics pointed out the absurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a civilian teacher, when the latter [arguably] provided a much more valueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society. This was an emotionally compelling argument, but even the proponents of that viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge some lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their \\\"contribution to society.\\\"  I view that doctrine as being both (a) personally repugnant and (b) repugnant to the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment.  Accordingly, I believe that there should be no laws which give any profession-based class of people special protection (via the mechanism of supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of that class), not even police officers, federal officers or high-ranking members of the Executive Branch of the federal government.\",\"  Game two of the Detroit - Toronto series will be a rougher game.

I was afraid you would say that!   Well, perhaps if the Braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be Lopez in there.  But they do have others worth playing, at least in *their* opinion.  And I happen to agree.   I can believe that.  I'm a newbie here, so I'll take your word.  But Alomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above. That is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long as they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such a consensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to give him that dreaded \\\"seasoning\\\".   Sorry.  New.  Don't know Nichols' Law.  Don't believe in catchers' era.  But I am interested in pitchers' eras with different catchers. Any info on that?   In other words, we know more than they do, so the only logic behind  a different decision than we would make must be financial.  I presume we feel this way about other franchises than Atlanta, no?   Well if it does make organizational sense, one can hardly fault them for their decisions.  I mean, please don't tell me how to run my business.  Especially when I'm being successful.   I'm sure you could be right.  You could also be smoking some illegal substance.  (Hey.  That's a joke.  Don't get offended.  Please.)  Well, I can't cite anyone's ethical rectitude because I don't know what it means.  :)  But again, if it makes organizational sense, then so be it.  Baseball is a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping Lopez on the farm then that's what the Braves *should* do.  I happen to believe that it's a baseball decision.  While you from your armchair may disagee, I don't.  I think there is a lot of evidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it among large guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I think it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainly more reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have released one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  It may also be logical.  I don't know what ethics have to do with it. Seems like pretty good common sense to me.  -- The Beastmaster  \",\"I missed the first part of this thread; are you switching line level or speaker level audio?

Data files should be examined and repaired.   You're not stupid.  Smartdrive caches things, and Windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also.  All of this is pretty risky stuff in a PC environment.   A reasonably accurate prediction...   Here's a brief description of how DOS stores files:  There are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain, and the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.  The directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size, and first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not important right now.  The File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find the actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the number is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it holds a \\\"magic\\\" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad (unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file.  The data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored. The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is doled out in \\\"chunks\\\" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster is 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.  To read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster. Next, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file. Naturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump around and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a time, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker which says it's the last cluster in the file.  CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into submission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to double-check anything it \\\"fixes\\\".  Now let's do a bit of a post-mortem:   All of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match the size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter the directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the directory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long. But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers, obviously, are made up.))   Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached to any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these \\\"lost chains\\\" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK through FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply be marked \\\"available\\\" in the FAT.    ...   These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously, one of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that C:\\\\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...  To fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name. This will \\\"fix\\\" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces. Now delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to assemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  \\\"Missing pieces\\\" are likely to be found in those \\\"lost chains\\\" at the top...)   Your disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of the problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space...  In any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT. There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage after something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the problem occurs.  Sorry.   --  ---------------------------------------------------- Gordon S.

You are probably thinking of Church of God in Christ, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.   2)  I'm not sure what you mean by \\\"signifying believers\\\"  but it should be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it ever, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian.  The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming a Christian in which one is \\\"Baptized in the Holy Spirit\\\"  That may be what you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order to be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the majority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in Mark 16 about \\\"these signs following them that believe\\\" but they generally do not interpret this as meaning if you don't pactice the signs you aren't \\\"saved\\\".   3)  I know it's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that has such diversity, but I think you've made some pretty big generalizations here.  Do \\\"Neo-Pentecostals\\\" only believe in tongues as a sign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message?  I've never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized them as believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as a sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not be inclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend, they do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be charismatic.\",\" I don't have the wiretap statute handy.

Here's some information about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have some money available...  John Spencer, 1993/04/21  Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn itself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21, (21:16-09:38 UT).  Timing is as follows;       1993 May 1-2          A-ring ingress  18:27                egress   19:30         B-ring ingress  19:51                egress   21:42         C-ring egress   23:00         Saturn ingress  23:59                egress   10:02         B-ring ingress  10:28                egress   12:19         A-ring ingress  12:40                egress   13:43       1993 July 20-21          Saturn ingress  21:16                egress   05:08         A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing)                egress   09:38  Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris, and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus' orbit.  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from Iapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about the rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy and Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my attention.  THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?     To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July   disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,   etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,   except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3   airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with   a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something   to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.    Jay  and again:    please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet   disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would   be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and   getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a   good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't   think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are   well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One   possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.  jay\",\"    Just a quick question. If Mary was Immaculately concieved, so she    could be a pure vessel, does this mean that she was without sin    and, therefore, the perfect (meaning sinless) female human being?    Is this why she is held so highly in the Catholic Church despite    it's basically patriarchical structure?  She was immaculately conceived, and so never subject to Original Sin, but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life.  This was possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by God.  She is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to God, and everything that flows from that relationship.  The Catholic Church sees her as the new Eve.  (The Fathers in the early Church use this particular figure a lot.)\",\"Can anybody please help me with information on the use of the bi-directional printer port.

But  most people aren't aware that in 1939 Hitler said that he would pattern his elimination of the Jews based upon what the Armenians did to Turkish people in 1914.        'After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?'       (Adolf Hitler, August 22, 1939: Ruth W. Rosenbaum (Durusoy),            \\\"The Turkish Holocaust - Turk Soykirimi\\\", p. 213.)   I refer to the Turks and Kurds as history's forgotten people. It does not serve our society well when most people are totally unaware of what happened in 1914 where a vicious society, run by fascist Armenians, decided to simply use the phoniest of pretexts as an excuse, for wiping  out a peace-loving, industrious, and very intelligent and productive  ethnic group. What we have is a demand from the fascist government of x-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our people. And the only way we can do that is if we can catch hold of and  not lose sight of the historical precedence in this very century. We  cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to  keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because  of their religion or their race. Which means that I support the claims  of the Turks and Kurds to return to their lands in x-Soviet Armenia,  to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

QM representation in natural language is not supposed to replace the elaborate representation in mathematical terminology. Nor is it supposed to be the truth, as opposed to the representation of gods or religions in ordinary language. Admittedly, not  every religion says so, but a fancy side effect of their inept representations are the eternal hassles between religions.   And QM allows for making experiments that will lead to results that will be agreed upon as being similar. Show me something similar in religion.

Apprec any advice.  Thanks,\",\"According to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking \\\"in X's name\\\" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today would call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus' culture authorized to conduct business \\\"in John's name\\\" had full authority over John's financial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to work only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes.  It was not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with \\\"in John's name\\\"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney and be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal and religious definitions of \\\"faith\\\".)  With this cultural background, praying \\\"in Jesus' name\\\" does not mandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous \\\"fiduciary\\\" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His Kingdom.  The message of \\\"praying in Jesus' name\\\" is thus closely aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God's delegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and responsibilities.  This idea of praying \\\"in Jesus' name\\\" is not only present but prominent in the Lord's Prayer, although the verbal forumula is absent.  The act of praying the words \\\"In Jesus' Name\\\" may be beneficial if they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the advancement of God's Kingdom.  For that reason, I'm not quite ready to say that the praying the formula is without meaning.  Prayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving, etc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by Christian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that's B.C.E. or C.E. for you P.C. :-).  I don't see anything in Christ's words to contradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His omniscience and grace.  Van Kelly vek@research.att.com \",\"Rob Butera asks about a book called THE LOST YEARS OF JESUS, by Elizabeth Clare Prophet.  I do not know the book. However, Miss Prophet is the leader of a group (The Church Universal and Triumphant) derived from the I AM group founded by a Mr. Ballard who began his mission in the 1930's (I am writing this from memory and may not have all the details straight -- for an old account, check your library for a bnook by Marcus Bach) after an eighteenth-century Frenchman appeared, tapped him on the shoulder, and offered him a cup of \\\"cosmic essence.\\\" A major tenet of the movement is that there is a monastery in the mountains of Tibet from which a monk descends to the lower altitudes every few centuries to preach, and that all major religions have been founded by monks from this monastery. Typically, the Ballard family and their successors, the Prophet family (related by marriage, if I remember aright), base almost all their teachings on messages they have allegedly received by telepathy from Tibet.

This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual world.  This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through history.  The Greek, for example, could say, \\\"better a beggar in the land of the living than a king in the land of the dead.\\\" (Iliad, I think).  The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is an ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adam or Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in their sins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentile humanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to him.  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him, through whom Satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment.   It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely extended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imagine an eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.  It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous were lost. This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness that fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with the sense world.  It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient people's ideas of life after death.   Mankind fell into mist and darkness, and at \\\"the turning point of time\\\" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, and we are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much new revelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.  Our new vision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and much more as well.  (At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf Steiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my views on this subject).   The way you refer to it as \\\"doctrine\\\" puts a modern intellectual coloring on it. I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or teachings today can be received.  I am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed on, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception and experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different people's ideas of the time immediately after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  In any case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid, but by contemplating the principles themselves.  On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity that originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the human being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is created at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas dominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does today. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our eternal spiritual being had grown dim.   Indeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a single earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in terms that did not try to spell it out. \",\"  Nobody ever exposed your crimes like that before?

May 4, 1982 - Cambridge, Massachusetts  Orhan Gunduz, the Turkish honorary consul in Boston, would not bow   to the Armenian terrorist ultimatum that he give up his title of   \\\"honorary consul\\\". Now he is attacked and murdered in cold blood.  President Reagan orders an all-out manhunt-to no avail. An eye-  witness who gave a description of the murderer is shot down.  He   survives... but falls silent. One of the most revolting \\\"triumphs\\\" in   the senseless, mindless history of Armenian terrorism. Such a murder   brings absolutely nothing - except an ego boost for the murderer   within the Armenian terrorist underworld, which is already wallowing   in self-satisfaction.   Were you involved in the murder of Sarik Ariyak?       December 17, 1980 - Sydney  Two Nazi Armenians massacre Sarik Ariyak and his bodyguard, Engin          Sever. JCAG and SDPA claim responsibility.  It is public knowledge that the founder of the Marxist-Leninist terrorist  organization, the ASALA (an integral part of ASALA/SDPA/ARF), Hagop Hagopian, began his notorious career as a member of the terrorist  group which perpetrated the massacre of the Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972. And the 'Armenian Foundation' stole from the  children of Turkiye to fund the criminal activities of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists in their cold-blooded murder of defenceless Turkish and Kurdish people.   THE ARMENIAN FOUNDATION PROVIDED 30 BILLION TL TO ASALA      01/09/92, MILLIYET-- The Armenian Foundation based in Istanbul is found to have provided 30 billion Turkish Lira ($6 million) to the Armenian terrorist organization ASALA which have murdered several Turkish diplomats abroad...   Experts on international terrorism assert that the Armenian terrorists use proceeds from drug trafficking (and from the Armenian Foundation) to fund their deadly enterprises. The deadliest of terrorist assassins, Carlos, proclaimed on Spanish television that his organization had entered into a working relationship with Armenian terrorists and they are using drug trafficking to raise money 'to continue' to slaughter innocent people. Now, what is your personal and organizational role  in this scheme?  Recent reports which have been confirmed by the U.S. Administration,  indicate that Armenian terrorist organizations are collaborating with  those who are responsible for the bombing of the United States Marine  barracks in Beirut.

President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 20 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following are remarks by President Clinton in a question and answer session with the press (Part 2 of 2):       Go ahead, Sarah.       Q  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The first is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't those people have a right to practice their religion?       THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their religion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had violated federal laws, any number of them.       Q  What federal laws --       THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't answer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of the things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of this because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.       They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be sent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected.       In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.       MS. MYERS:  Last question.       Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --       Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments?       THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said -- and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that the people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were right or wrong, of course, we will never know.       What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the building burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up. That's the first thing I wanted to know.       Thank you.       Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a Janet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't go over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I take responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had elapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said, if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you. And I do support her.       She is not ultimately responsible to the American people; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as well as she could have.       Thank you.  (Applause.)\",\" Tom's right about this.

It's always easier to obtain forgiveness than permission.

Look at what the Bush administration did to get material for the Drug War on the Constitution--remember that baggie of crack George waved at the cameras?  They took a dealer from the ghetto and brought him to the White House so they could say drugs had been dealt onb the White House Lawn. And I don't think anybody could honestly think Clinton would have any moral qualms about the raid... The only really worrisome thing is that the BD's heroic defense of their ranch will make Clinton's Gun War on the Constitution _more_ successfull--exactly as he wanted.  The media and politicians will filter this so that the general public will think the BD's are bad guys!  Don't help them.  Stand up for the BD's with your friends and family adnd in public anytime you can--their supposed moral qualms are not important to the issue.

The working of both drivers is totally the same.  When I ran dos, I preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat, because some programs won't run with some drivers and I could choose the ones I needed during startup. But with DRDOS6, this advantage is gone, because DRDOS lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded.  Michael\",\"  Their testimony would be a contradiction of the plaintiff's charge (and witness) that the occupant moved after the impact, indicating he was alive and trying to get out (and provoking all sorts of sympathetic 'gross, burned alive' reactions).

I have a IIsi that came with a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.   First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum quarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them was stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a problem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for over two months.  The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal hard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard connector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare cable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found in any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of shorts or bad connections.  Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk ribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another male connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again, and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not damaged, and I can go back to the original setup.  Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this day.   In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of the drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are intact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal should be terminated at all the ends.

It seems from the following that the CPSR is atleats starting to question this bogosity:      ---------------------------------------------------------------- April 16, 1993 Washington, DC                 COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC            DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE          Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today called for the public disclosure of technical data underlying the government's newly-announced \\\"Public Encryption Management\\\" initiative.  The new cryptography scheme was announced today by the White House and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super- secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.          According to NIST, the technical specifications and the Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non-military computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of such standards.          CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in developing the so-called \\\"digital signature standard\\\" (DSS), a communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard. NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of records concerning its creation of the DSS.          David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of electronic communications, as reflected in today's official statement,  \\\"a step in the right direction.\\\"  But he questioned the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny.  \\\"At a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital that standards designed to protect personal privacy be established openly and with full public participation.  It is not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to play a leading role in the development process.\\\"          CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on society.

When we die we are released from the arc of time, and able to comprehend our lives in toto.  To visit each moment in time sequentially or all at once, but not able to alter the actions thoughts or feelings we had/have/will have in this  life.  From that perspective, I posit that all will have direct knowledge of God, and be able to recognize at each moment of time wether we were doing what we ought.  That the experience of having lived a life far from God will be an eternal torment.  That  having lived a life of grace, will be an eternal joy.

Please respond to doug@sun.sws.uiuc.edu\",\"I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've  transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois. ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.  The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king, who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which  the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million, His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual, seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of slots.  The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions supporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from  70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside). According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and  the Pacific Rim.   RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money. Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began  negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in  Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time. Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way that people operate.  For example \\\"everybody can sell you everything.\\\"   Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.  Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who  went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually, he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the  Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to  allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.  The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied  Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in  Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners :-)  Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is  apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them  specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1 million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their  satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They  have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place now.  Tidbits:  *  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big business because big business is just like what they have over there, except that \\\"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\\\"  *  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months.  *  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia, and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.  *  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried partly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying monolith.  Italy gets a new government \\\"every two weeks\\\" but we don't worry  because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.  *  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting 25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \\\"equivalent\\\" value in  rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government.  *  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western  satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites, which was rather reassuring.  *  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much  shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the  difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition, shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date hardware. \",\"I am looking for some graphic images of earth shot from space.

Fixed disk sectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is quite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the controller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 wasn't cached, the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance, and it's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more loss of CPU cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence.  The floppy, on the other hand, is not buffered, so that using the CPU for floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr, by the way) really does stink.\",\" The code fragment looks reasonable, but is your logic valid?

Basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling and the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the hot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is rapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently seen rising out of these towers.  That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.  The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference (sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage \\\"hot\\\" turbine to final stage \\\"cold\\\" turbine).

The EPA list is attached.    \\\"These internal EPA documents reveal that the safety of water supplies in many American cities is threatened by inadequate pollution controls or filtration,\\\" said Erik Olson, a senior attorney with NRDC.  \\\"Water contamination isn't just a problem in Bangladesh, it's also a problem in Bozeman and Boston.\\\"    \\\"As of June 29, 1993, about 100 large surface water systems on EPA's list probably will be breaking the law.  The 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to either filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use from pollution,\\\" Olson continued.  Some systems are moving towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are expected to miss the law's deadline.    Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already a reality in other cities.  A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surface water systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent of raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organism cryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasite called giardia.    Adding to the level of concern, a General Accounting Office study released today by House Health and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the nation's system for conducting and following through on sanitary surveys of water systems.    \\\"This new information raises a huge warning sign that millions of Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be assured that their water is safe to drink.  We must immediately put into place programs to protect water sources from contamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipment must be installed to protect the public,\\\" Olson noted.  \\\"The time has come for many of the nation's water utilities to stop dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from contamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs needed to assure their water is safe to drink.\\\"    NRDC is a national non-profit environmental advocacy organization.

For sanity's sake we must assume, if we believe in Him at all, that His message comes through somehow.  The question is whether it comes  through immediately to every individual, or is contained in a complex  canon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another,  or is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free to interpret, extend and modify the canon.  If God's message is indeed mediated, the further problem arises as to whether the individual under- stands the mediated message fully and clearly.  Since the responsibility  for understanding lies ultimately with the individual, we must assume that  God in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source  for that individual, whereof the person may or may not drink.        Your example is complicated in our age by the thin line between morality and politeness.  You might have said \\\"burp\\\", for burping and swearing carry about the same stigma today.  If you are talking about \\\"taking the Lord's  name in vain\\\" as a serious transgression, then this example is more a case of  hypocrisy than of varying moral codes.   If there is an absolute moral code, propositions or laws in that code apply absolutely and universally, by definition.  Conceivably some moral codes could be subsets of the universal code, as you say at the outset.  So, for example, God's code could include, \\\"Thou shalt not create Beings without a hospitable planet to live on\\\", but this law would be inapplicable to us. Nevertheless, we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicable to us are also applicable to God.   But when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God's moral code, you have a sense of the absurdity of the question.  Does God make laws for Himself to follow?  Perhaps God is not the sort of being to which the category \\\"morality\\\" can be sensibly applied.\",\"    The majority of those who can open their mouths in public perhaps. There seems quite alot of incentive for the British to have control of NI, like using the North Channel and Irish Sea as a waste dump (I was appalled at the dumping I saw in the harbor in Belfast). It is my understanding that quite alot of radioactivity enters the water -- it'd be quite a problem if NI got its independence from Britain and then stopped accepting the waste. Are you suggesting that British industry isn't making profit off the situation as well? \",\"   Not if you've scored four runs, you don't!  Why strain even the best pitching staff?  Why not make it easier for them?    In the 2-1 game, the best pitching staff in the world can't compensate for a blown call, a bad hop, a gust of wind.  Winning close is the  wrong way to win; both keeping opposing runs down AND scoring a lot  yourself are insurance against the \\\"Shit happens\\\" aspect of baseball.  Not every great teamhas even *good* pitching.  The Big Red Machine of the 70's was league-average in pitching.  But somehow, Rose-Morgan-Bench- Perez-etc. managed to win 100 games more than once, peaking at 108.\",\" Do people expect the Texans congressmen to act as the N.J.

Actually, I bet you more gay/bi men are as not as promiscuous as gay men,  because more of them could have the \\\"option\\\" of living a straight life, and  with social pressures, probably would at least try.

I   mean, heck, if Dave Winfield (ho-hum) is seriously being considered for it, as  is Lee Smith (ha), then why don't we give Dave Kingman a chance? Or Darrell  Evans! Yeah, yeah! After the Hall of Fame takes in them, it can take in Eddie  Murray and Jeff Reardon.       Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody giving  Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards, marginal.  Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both  shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.       Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors so  liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if something  isn't done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When  certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential  candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to  the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan? \",\" It appears that Walla Walla College will fill the same role in alt.atheist that Allegheny College fills in alt.fan.dan-quayle.   Converts to xtianity have this tendency to excessively darken their pre-xtian past, frequently falsely.  Anyone who embarks on an effort to \\\"destroy\\\" xtianity is suffering from deep megalomania, a defect which is not cured by religious conversion.   Different perspective?  DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE??  BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!   (sigh!)  Perhaps Big J was just mistaken about some of his claims. Perhaps he was normally insightful, but had a few off days.  Perhaps many (most?) of the statements attributed to Jesus were not made by him, but were put into his mouth by later authors.  Other possibilities abound.  Surely, someone seriously examining this question could come up with a decent list of possible alternatives, unless the task is not serious examination of the question (much less \\\"destroying\\\" xtianity) but rather religious salesmanship.   How many Germans died for Nazism?  How many Russians died in the name of the proletarian dictatorship?  How many Americans died to make the world safe for \\\"democracy\\\".  What a silly question!   Is everyone who performs a healing = God?   It's probably hard to \\\"draw\\\" an entire nation to you unless you  are crazy.
