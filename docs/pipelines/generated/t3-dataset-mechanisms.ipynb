Hentrich        baba@Tymnet.Com -    I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich calling himself an Aryan.  The word `Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first in the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda.  It seems to have been a tribal term but may have had connotations of good character.  Such connotations are quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the eightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholar Max Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the Nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is synonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  The people who originally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans and possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the word by Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is nontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claim to call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor- shipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.    If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory's book, ``In search of the Indo-Europeans\\\" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica. The reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and for Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible things done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans have no clear claim.\",\"  There is one reason: market size.

The Woman is the Church.  Catholics have always called our Church \\\"Holy Mother Church\\\" and our \\\"Mother.\\\"  An example would be from St. Cyprian of Carthage, who wrote in 251 AD, \\\"Can anyone have God for his Father, who does not have the Church for his mother?\\\"  Hence the image of the Church as a woman, holding a Cross and a Cup, which tell of the Crucifxition of Our Lord, and of the power of His Blood (the grail legend, but also, more significantly, it shows that \\\"This is the Cup of the New Covenant in my blood, which shall be shed for you and for many.\\\" (Luke 22.20), the Cup represents the New Covenant and holds the blood of redemption).  The fact that the woman is holding both and is said to have the whole world for her seat, is that the Catholic Church is catholic, that is universal, and is found throughout the world, and the Church shows the Crucifixtion and applies the blood of redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers, thorugh which the Holy Sacrafice of the Mass, can be said and celebrated in all the nations as Malachi predicted in Malachi 1.11, \\\"From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is great among the gentiles, and everywhere there is sacrafice, and there is offered to my Name a clean oblation, for my Name is great among the gentiles, says the Lord of hosts.\\\"  And so we acknowledge what St. Paul wrote \\\"For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death until he comes.\\\" (1 Corinthians 11.26)   You are quite right about the identification of \\\"Babylon the Great, Mother of all Harlots\\\" with Rome.  I think we simply disagree as to what time period of Rome the Apostle John is talking about.\",\" Then don't complain (maybe it wasn't you) that SCSI was so expensive on PC's because all we've had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus. (ie no one buys SCSI for ISA because ISA is slow) Are you saying that SCSI on an ISA bus is not an automatic winner when compared to IDE?   I get different transfer rates out of my IDE when I change my ISA bus speed.   IDE is just a variant of the old IBM- MFM AT controller.  (at least that's how it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different platforms.  Is there any argument that  IDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the drive is able to provide the data?  Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface (because of a higher RPM platter, different arrangement of heads, etc?)?   If data is going from one drive to another, and if SCSI has the ability to perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main memory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know, IDE can't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored in main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives  at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the same time?  Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA (or whatever) bus?   A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that's 245 million bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface, he gets close to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers?   So you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type, considering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or tape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and run DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives at the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years ago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice.   But on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you get more performance for the money.  For all the people that will only have a single hard drive in their system (regardless of the OS) will the SCSI choice really give them more performance than IDE?   True, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option is there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.   No argument.  This is always held up to the first time SCSI buyer as the best reason.  But how many SCSI devices will the first time SCSI buyer eventually acquire?  Again does it make sense to go SCSI for a single hard drive system?   With all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs, are you really sure that PC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible?  And even if they are,  is the data accessible from either machine (ie are there no formatting/ partitioning or file table differences?)  Is it really plug'n'play?   So the C: drive on the connor becomes a logical D: drive to DOS.  Is this really a problem?     After having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers, I have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor have I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or to/from the same drive.   That is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up).  I do believe that there is the possibility for up to 4 IDE drives on a PC. \"]],[\"SUBSET\",[\"raw\",\"raw\",\"raw\",\"raw\",\"raw\",\"raw\",\"raw\",\"raw\",\"raw\",\"raw\",\"raw\"]],[\"label\",[\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\"]]]}}},\"view\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"CDSView\",\"id\":\"p1053\",\"attributes\":{\"filter\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"AllIndices\",\"id\":\"p1054\"}}},\"columns\":[{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"TableColumn\",\"id\":\"p1043\",\"attributes\":{\"field\":\"text\",\"title\":\"text\",\"formatter\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"HTMLTemplateFormatter\",\"id\":\"p1042\",\"attributes\":{\"template\":\"<span href=\\\"#\\\" data-toggle=\\\"tooltip\\\" title=\\\"<%= value %>\\\"><%= value %></span>\"}},\"editor\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"CellEditor\",\"id\":\"p1041\"}}},{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"TableColumn\",\"id\":\"p1046\",\"attributes\":{\"field\":\"label\",\"title\":\"label\",\"formatter\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"StringFormatter\",\"id\":\"p1047\"},\"editor\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"StringEditor\",\"id\":\"p1048\"}}}],\"editable\":true,\"selectable\":\"checkbox\"}}],\"callbacks\":{\"type\":\"map\"}}};\n",

Hentrich        baba@Tymnet.Com -    I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich calling himself an Aryan.  The word `Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first in the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda.  It seems to have been a tribal term but may have had connotations of good character.  Such connotations are quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the eightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholar Max Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the Nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is synonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  The people who originally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans and possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the word by Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is nontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claim to call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor- shipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.    If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory's book, ``In search of the Indo-Europeans\\\" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica. The reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and for Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible things done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans have no clear claim.\",\"  There is one reason: market size.

(and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years ago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice.   But on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you get more performance for the money.  For all the people that will only have a single hard drive in their system (regardless of the OS) will the SCSI choice really give them more performance than IDE?   True, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option is there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.   No argument.  This is always held up to the first time SCSI buyer as the best reason.  But how many SCSI devices will the first time SCSI buyer eventually acquire?  Again does it make sense to go SCSI for a single hard drive system?   With all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs, are you really sure that PC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible?  And even if they are,  is the data accessible from either machine (ie are there no formatting/ partitioning or file table differences?)  Is it really plug'n'play?   So the C: drive on the connor becomes a logical D: drive to DOS.  Is this really a problem?     After having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers, I have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor have I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or to/from the same drive.   That is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up).  I do believe that there is the possibility for up to 4 IDE drives on a PC. \"]],[\"SUBSET\",[\"raw\",\"raw\",\"raw\",\"raw\",\"raw\",\"raw\",\"raw\",\"raw\",\"raw\",\"raw\",\"raw\"]],[\"label\",[\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\",\"ABSTAIN\"]]]}}},\"view\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"CDSView\",\"id\":\"p1053\",\"attributes\":{\"filter\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"AllIndices\",\"id\":\"p1054\"}}},\"columns\":[{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"TableColumn\",\"id\":\"p1043\",\"attributes\":{\"field\":\"text\",\"title\":\"text\",\"formatter\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"HTMLTemplateFormatter\",\"id\":\"p1042\",\"attributes\":{\"template\":\"<span href=\\\"#\\\" data-toggle=\\\"tooltip\\\" title=\\\"<%= value %>\\\"><%= value %></span>\"}},\"editor\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"CellEditor\",\"id\":\"p1041\"}}},{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"TableColumn\",\"id\":\"p1046\",\"attributes\":{\"field\":\"label\",\"title\":\"label\",\"formatter\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"StringFormatter\",\"id\":\"p1047\"},\"editor\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"StringEditor\",\"id\":\"p1048\"}}}],\"editable\":true,\"selectable\":\"checkbox\"}}]}}],\"callbacks\":{\"type\":\"map\"}}};\n",
