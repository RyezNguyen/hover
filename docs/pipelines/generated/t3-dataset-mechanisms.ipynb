In this configuration, X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window, giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.     The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables.     Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?\",\"    I like the Mariners a lot, but my heart belongs to the Cubs...You can imagine my frustration when I saw the Cubs nabbing LeFebvre...ARHGGHRGHH!  -John Neuharth\",\" [deleted]   Keep in mind this was in Massachussetts.

As a lo-o-o-ong time sufferer of tinnitus and as a neuroscientist who has looked over the literature carefully I believe the following are reasonable conclusions:  1. Millions of people suffer from chronic tinnitus. 2. The cause it not understood. 3. There is no accepted treatment that cures it. 4. Some experimental treatments may have helped some people a bit, but there have be no reports--even anecdotal--of massive good results with any of these experimental drugs. 5. Some people with chronic loud tinnitus use noise blocking to get to sleep. 6. Sudden onset loud tinnitus can be caused by injuries and sometimes abates or goes away after a few months. 7. Aspirin is well known to exacerbate tinnitus in some people. 8. There is a national association of tinnitus sufferers in the US. 9. One usually gets used to it.  Especially when concentrating on something else the tinnitus becomes unnoticed. 10.  Stress and lack of sleep make tinnitus more annoying, sometimes. 11.  I'm sure those of us who have it wish there was a cure, but there is not.\",\"Dear Folks:  It's a pleasure to be able to announce the release of a new freeware program,  Xavier, an audio and video  extension to InterViews.  Xavier(eXtension AV class for IntERviews) is a C++ class library that adds multimedia capability to InterViews. It allows composite multimedia objects to be built from media objects.  Specifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the source code for the original classes (though several configuration files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file).    Currently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN workstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.  Xavier has been tested in the following environments:  SUN:   Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC   OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later   C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1  NEC(EWS):   Machine : EWS4800/210,230   OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1,Release5.2   C++     : C++ Release3.1  It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from            interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/           (Xavier.large-demo.tar, and Xavier.tar)  We are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier. If you are interested, please contact                                    xavier@tsl.cl.nec.co.jp.   I will add your e-mail address to our list.

We've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level for most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined slights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'll happen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I've seen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep the next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact with us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his choice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.    From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a relationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful relationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, \\\"Why be dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse to get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to come back.\\\" It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on with the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I could think of.    Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and raved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and in which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was beyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the allowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not quietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their relationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung up. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is the first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if she's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have the break out in the open and done with.       I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself; angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for persisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their children; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us that he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to appease an unappeasable, emotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess; scared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will change and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self- righteous over this bit of proof that they can't \\\"get away\\\" with treating us or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even beginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad, sad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in a horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--or they can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustrated because I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me up the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence, and vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am not free of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO* something, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besetting vices; I'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal mental chatter enough to listen for God.)   Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? Is this a time to reach out to my brother? To let things be? How can I conquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him?   Here's the big question I've been evading throughout this long, long post: Is it ok, as a Christian and a proponent of faith, hope, and charity, to accept the destruction of a relationship? To give up on my own brother, or at least to accept that I am powerless to help him and can only wait and see what happens? Do please answer--by e-mail or post.

Thanks again, \",\"A colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new MIPS workstation. When he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration, X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window, giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.     The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables.     Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?\",\"    I like the Mariners a lot, but my heart belongs to the Cubs...You can imagine my frustration when I saw the Cubs nabbing LeFebvre...ARHGGHRGHH!  -John Neuharth\",\" [deleted]   Keep in mind this was in Massachussetts.

The Itar-TASS news agency announced the launch of Cosmos 2238 from  Plesetsk Cosmodrome, but provided little description of the payload's mission.       However, based on the satellite's trajectory, Western observers  identified it as a military spacecraft designed to monitor electronic  emissions from foreign naval ships in order to track their movement.

As a lo-o-o-ong time sufferer of tinnitus and as a neuroscientist who has looked over the literature carefully I believe the following are reasonable conclusions:  1. Millions of people suffer from chronic tinnitus. 2. The cause it not understood. 3. There is no accepted treatment that cures it. 4. Some experimental treatments may have helped some people a bit, but there have be no reports--even anecdotal--of massive good results with any of these experimental drugs. 5. Some people with chronic loud tinnitus use noise blocking to get to sleep. 6. Sudden onset loud tinnitus can be caused by injuries and sometimes abates or goes away after a few months. 7. Aspirin is well known to exacerbate tinnitus in some people. 8. There is a national association of tinnitus sufferers in the US. 9. One usually gets used to it.  Especially when concentrating on something else the tinnitus becomes unnoticed. 10.  Stress and lack of sleep make tinnitus more annoying, sometimes. 11.  I'm sure those of us who have it wish there was a cure, but there is not.\",\"Dear Folks:  It's a pleasure to be able to announce the release of a new freeware program,  Xavier, an audio and video  extension to InterViews.  Xavier(eXtension AV class for IntERviews) is a C++ class library that adds multimedia capability to InterViews. It allows composite multimedia objects to be built from media objects.  Specifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the source code for the original classes (though several configuration files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file).    Currently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN workstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.  Xavier has been tested in the following environments:  SUN:   Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC   OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later   C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1  NEC(EWS):   Machine : EWS4800/210,230   OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1,Release5.2   C++     : C++ Release3.1  It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from            interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/           (Xavier.large-demo.tar, and Xavier.tar)  We are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier. If you are interested, please contact                                    xavier@tsl.cl.nec.co.jp.   I will add your e-mail address to our list.

We've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level for most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined slights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'll happen by the end of a single restaurant meal).
