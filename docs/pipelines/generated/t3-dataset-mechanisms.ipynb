Presumably, he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about MSG making people ill.   Similarly, debunking such claims without doing research (whether literature and lab), is equally beside the point. The original poster no doubt already knows that some people think 'Chinese Restaurant Syndrome' is bogus.  Placebos are all very interesting, but irrelevant to the question of what effects MSG has. You could have real effects *and* placebo effects; people may have allergies in addition.    Have you read Olney's work? I fail to see how citing results from peer-reviewed studies qualifies as \\\"bizarrely cracked\\\".   Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys, as well. I have never seen a study where the mode of administration was intra-ventricular.  The Glu and Asp were administered orally. Some studies used IV and SC. Intra-ventricular is not a normal admin. method for food tox. studies, for obvious reasons. You must not have read the peer-reviewed works that I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain injection bunk.   Pardon me, but where are you getting this from? Have you read the journals? Have you done a thorough literature search?  But, you're right, mice aren't the best to study this on. They're four times less sensitive than humans to MSG.   The point is exceeding the window. Of course, they're amino acids. Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine.  Olney's research compared infant human diets. Specifically, the amount of freely available Glu in mother's milk versus commercial baby foods, vs. typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged soup mixes. He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin for infant humans by at least four-fold in a single meal of processed foods. Mother's milk was well below the effective dose.    Between who? Over what? I would be most interested in seeing you provide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citations to articles disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever.

I mess with this older stuff alot.   Kinda fun.  8)       First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.        Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on the board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should read  either :     62-000042-015 or              62-000094-0x2       If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.       Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.       Looks right.    [art deleted]         I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have the 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:                5 + +    open               6 + +    open                            7 + +    open                       8 + +    open               4 + +    closed               3 + +    closed               2 + +    open               1 + +    open      Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block. Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8 select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the second drive (drive 1).           If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll have to look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.         See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not right.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables are on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it to the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.         The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few times and banged my head for a day.....        Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way to check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:                 -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)         This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.         If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.     It's just hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to. 8).                       -->   Bob Valentine  <--                     --> ravalent@mailbox.syr.edu <--      From chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za Mon Apr  5 06:33:46 1993 Received: from unitrix.utr.ac.za by ponder (5.61/1.36)  id AA16194; Mon, 5 Apr 93 06:32:59 -0500 Received: by unitrix.utr.ac.za (Smail3.1.28.1 #1)  id m0nfpMA-0001X7C; Mon, 5 Apr 93 13:28 GMT Message-Id: <m0nfpMA-0001X7C@unitrix.utr.ac.za> From: chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za (Prof P.

NOTE 1:  AT&T 6300 - The AT&T 6300 and the AT&T 6300 PLUS            contain system BIOS chips that support the hard disk drive.             When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will            not \\\"boot.\\\"  To solve this problem, one of the ROM BIOS chips            must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital             XT controller card, you must remove the jumper at position W-3            or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT            controller you are using).                                                   -2-                        NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1, WD1004A-WX1,            WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in            Tandy 1000 series computers, models SX, TX and the original or            \\\"A\\\" version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2)            instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or            the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the            etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then            solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the            modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1            (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION            TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY            ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the            WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must            be soldered to jumper position W-27.  This will change the            interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.

I won't go on with the things the wacko of Waco did. \",\" Many people responded with more anecdotal stories; I think its safe to say the original poster is already familiar with such stories. Presumably, he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about MSG making people ill.   Similarly, debunking such claims without doing research (whether literature and lab), is equally beside the point. The original poster no doubt already knows that some people think 'Chinese Restaurant Syndrome' is bogus.  Placebos are all very interesting, but irrelevant to the question of what effects MSG has. You could have real effects *and* placebo effects; people may have allergies in addition.    Have you read Olney's work? I fail to see how citing results from peer-reviewed studies qualifies as \\\"bizarrely cracked\\\".   Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys, as well. I have never seen a study where the mode of administration was intra-ventricular.  The Glu and Asp were administered orally. Some studies used IV and SC. Intra-ventricular is not a normal admin. method for food tox. studies, for obvious reasons. You must not have read the peer-reviewed works that I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain injection bunk.   Pardon me, but where are you getting this from? Have you read the journals? Have you done a thorough literature search?  But, you're right, mice aren't the best to study this on. They're four times less sensitive than humans to MSG.   The point is exceeding the window. Of course, they're amino acids. Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine.  Olney's research compared infant human diets. Specifically, the amount of freely available Glu in mother's milk versus commercial baby foods, vs. typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged soup mixes. He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin for infant humans by at least four-fold in a single meal of processed foods. Mother's milk was well below the effective dose.    Between who? Over what? I would be most interested in seeing you provide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citations to articles disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever.

I mess with this older stuff alot.   Kinda fun.  8)       First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.        Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on the board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should read  either :     62-000042-015 or              62-000094-0x2       If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.       Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.       Looks right.    [art deleted]         I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have the 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:                5 + +    open               6 + +    open                            7 + +    open                       8 + +    open               4 + +    closed               3 + +    closed               2 + +    open               1 + +    open      Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block. Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8 select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the second drive (drive 1).           If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll have to look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.         See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not right.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables are on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it to the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.         The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few times and banged my head for a day.....        Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way to check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:                 -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)         This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.         If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.     It's just hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to. 8).                       -->   Bob Valentine  <--                     --> ravalent@mailbox.syr.edu <--      From chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za Mon Apr  5 06:33:46 1993 Received: from unitrix.utr.ac.za by ponder (5.61/1.36)  id AA16194; Mon, 5 Apr 93 06:32:59 -0500 Received: by unitrix.utr.ac.za (Smail3.1.28.1 #1)  id m0nfpMA-0001X7C; Mon, 5 Apr 93 13:28 GMT Message-Id: <m0nfpMA-0001X7C@unitrix.utr.ac.za> From: chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za (Prof P.

When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will            not \\\"boot.\\\"  To solve this problem, one of the ROM BIOS chips            must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital             XT controller card, you must remove the jumper at position W-3            or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT            controller you are using).                                                   -2-                        NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1, WD1004A-WX1,            WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in            Tandy 1000 series computers, models SX, TX and the original or            \\\"A\\\" version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2)            instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or            the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the            etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then            solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the            modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1            (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION            TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY            ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the            WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must            be soldered to jumper position W-27.  This will change the            interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.
