I would not be surprised in the least to find out the SOME people have bad reactions to MSG, including headaches, stomachaches and even vomiting.

Can anyone give me this information, or tell me where I can find the book?  None of my local bookstores have it.\",\"Well, I gotta tell ya,  last night's Leafs game vs the Devils was a nail-bitter LET ME TELL YOU! It was a well played game by BOTH teams (I thought) but according to the Don and Ron it was the an \\\"off-night\\\" for the Leafs and the Devils  were outplaying Toronto. Well, I BEG to differ....  IMHO, Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. His fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he created reminded me of the Clark of old. (But not to take any of the credit away from Gilmour).  I think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey. WHY?  Well first look at their injury list which includes, Cullen, Ellet, Zezel, Macoun. Of course my question is this....how will the Leafs fare when they are once again \\\"healthy\\\" if they are playing this well so far??  Second, just look at their standings, still second in defence, moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, haven't lost at home in last 12 games, 8 game undefeated streak..etc. (BTW, am I wrong or was this Potvin's first shut-out? I can't  remember him having any as of yet.)  Well, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris has truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and Toronto. And the best game of the season will probably be their last against each other. (is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to see this one?)  Coming to the stretch and still a ROAR'IN!!!!! Go LEAFS Go!!!!\",\" Why do you think Steere is doing this?  Isn't he acting in good faith? After all, as the \\\"discoverer\\\" of Lyme for all intents and purposes, the more famous Lyme gets, the more famous Steere gets.  I don't see the ulterior motive here.  It is easy for me to see it the those physicians who call everything lyme and treat everything. There is a lot of money involved.   Well, it is tragic what has happened to you, but it doesn't necessarily make you the most objective source of information about it.  If your whole life is focussed around this, you may be too emotionally involved to be advising other people who may or may not have Lyme.  Certainly advocacy of more research on Lyme would not be out of order, though, and people like you can be very effective there.      --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\"NJ> : >And, while we are on the subject, has a captain ever been  traded,   NJ> : >resigned, or been striped of his title during the season?

Mike Foligno was captain of the Buffalo Sabres when he was traded to Toronto.\",\"  The idea of the U.S, or any other nation, taking action, i.e., military intervention, in Bosnia has not been well thought out by those who  advocate such action. After the belligerants are subdued, it would require an occupation force for one or two generations. If you will stop and think about it, you will realize that these people have never forgotten a single slight or injury, they have imbibed hatred with their mother's milk. If we stop the fighting, seize and destroy all weapons, they will simply go back to killing each other with clubs. And the price for this futility will be the lives of the young men and women we send there to die. A price I am unwilling to even consider.   There is no valid comparison to the Holocaust. All of the Jewish people that I have known as friends were not brought up to hate. To be wary of others, most certainly, but not to hate. And except for the Warsaw uprising, they were unarmed (and even in Warsaw badly out-gunned). It is very easy to speak of muscle when they are someone else's muscles. Suppose we do this thing, what will you tell the parents, wives, children, lovers of those we are sending to die? That they gave their lives in some noble cause? Noble cause, separating some mad dogs who will turn on them.  Well, I will offer you some muscle. Suppose we tell them that they have one week (this will give foreign nationals time to leave) to cease their bloodshed. At the end of that week, bring in the Tomahawk firing ships and destroy Belgrade as they destroyed the Bosnian cities. Perhaps when some of their cities are reduced to rubble they will have a sudden attack of brains. Send in missiles by all means, but do not send in troops.   By all means lift the embargo.

With respect to church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while other people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more solitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized if confronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of people.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.  My impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and create environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted (there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I am quite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churches to participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very uncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly influenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing. (BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both preferences have their place in the Body).  Maybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words are usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvert scale is a measure of how a person is energized.

I would not be surprised in the least to find out the SOME people have bad reactions to MSG, including headaches, stomachaches and even vomiting.

IMHO, Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. His fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he created reminded me of the Clark of old. (But not to take any of the credit away from Gilmour).  I think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey. WHY?  Well first look at their injury list which includes, Cullen, Ellet, Zezel, Macoun. Of course my question is this....how will the Leafs fare when they are once again \\\"healthy\\\" if they are playing this well so far??  Second, just look at their standings, still second in defence, moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, haven't lost at home in last 12 games, 8 game undefeated streak..etc. (BTW, am I wrong or was this Potvin's first shut-out? I can't  remember him having any as of yet.)  Well, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris has truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and Toronto. And the best game of the season will probably be their last against each other. (is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to see this one?)  Coming to the stretch and still a ROAR'IN!!!!!

After all, as the \\\"discoverer\\\" of Lyme for all intents and purposes, the more famous Lyme gets, the more famous Steere gets.  I don't see the ulterior motive here.  It is easy for me to see it the those physicians who call everything lyme and treat everything. There is a lot of money involved.   Well, it is tragic what has happened to you, but it doesn't necessarily make you the most objective source of information about it.  If your whole life is focussed around this, you may be too emotionally involved to be advising other people who may or may not have Lyme.  Certainly advocacy of more research on Lyme would not be out of order, though, and people like you can be very effective there.      --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\"NJ> : >And, while we are on the subject, has a captain ever been  traded,   NJ> : >resigned, or been striped of his title during the season?

After the belligerants are subdued, it would require an occupation force for one or two generations.

If we stop the fighting, seize and destroy all weapons, they will simply go back to killing each other with clubs.
