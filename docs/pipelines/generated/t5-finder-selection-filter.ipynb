If I forgot or botched your favorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there's an acronym *not* on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure it out, I'll add it to the list.  Note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen* acronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporated every acronym I ever saw, I'd soon run out of disk space!  :-)  The list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  All comments regarding it are welcome; I'm reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.  Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you're on your own for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of acronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that are essentially always explained as they're introduced are omitted. Further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of the list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they're simply different ways of referring to the same thing.  Thanks to everybody who's sent suggestions since the first version of the list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu), who is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in character than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de), who is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and terms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).  Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA Reference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and Associated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly mammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.  Special Bonus!  At the end of this posting, you will find a perl program written by none other than Larry Wall, whose purpose is to scramble the acronym list in an entertaining fashion.

I have used Procomm, Kermit, and Softerm (on OS/2) on the PC (or PS) side. I have used non-Hardware handshaking and hardware ahdshaking cables. And know MY hands are shaking from the effort. Nothing has allowed file transfers from the Mac to the PS.  In general, I can type back and forth with no trouble, but only if both sides are set to speeds OVER 9600 baud. I cannot send files from the Mac to the PS at all, and file transfers from the Duo to the PS are not possible. When I do a straight ascii send, I can send from the PS to the Duo flawlessly. I can send Binhex files this way quite fast, and I know that the transmission is error free. But straight ascii sent from the Mac to the PS is full of errors. Unless, of course, I do text pacing so slow that it is like human typing. (well, like 2-3 times faster than human typing).  I would like to hear from ANYONE who has been able to transfer files from a Duo 210 to a PS via modem or null modem. If you can do it, please tell me your EXACT combination of hardware and software. Obviously, I am talking of a true serial port modem, not the express modem. Maybe some kind soul with access to a modem and a Duo 210 can check this out for me.  Right now, I am of the opinion that it won't work at high speeds because of the power interrupts on the Duo, and it won't work at low speeds because of some crazy reason I don't understand.  Could I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information out the serial port of a Duo 210 fast? Like via a modem or via a sys-ex dump?  Could anyone with a Duo help me out?? I am going absolutely INSANE. I wanna know if the problem is MY Duo, or all Duo 210s, or all Duos, or just me.  Yes, I have checked the cable 1,000,000 times. And not only can I type back and forth, but Zterm alerts the users if s/he uses hardware handshaking and CTS is down. So I know that hardware handshaking is working. And also, According to Zterm port stats, the buffer never overflows.

With \\\"pseudo\\\" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then negative, which is the normal situation. \\\"Real\\\" internists can talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple of minutes.  Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only \\\"true\\\" clubbing is associated with disease. The problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is very reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the  congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization.   The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally.   Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however, the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.\",\"I was reading Popular Science this morning and was surprised by an ad in the back.  I know that a lot of the ads in the back of PS are fringe science or questionablely legal, but this one really grabbed my attention. It was from a company name \\\"Personal Missle, Inc.\\\" or something like that.  Anyhow, the ad stated that they'd sell rockets that were up to 20' in length and engines of sizes \\\"F\\\" to \\\"M\\\".  They also said that some rockets will reach 50,000 feet.  Now, aside from the obvious dangers to any amateur rocketeer using one of these beasts, isn't this illegal?  I can't imagine the FAA allowing people to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes. Not to even mention the problem of locating a rocket when it comes down.

Allen \",\" \\\"fete\\\"??? Since this word both formally and commonly refers to positive/joyous events, your misuse of it here is rather unsettling.    I certainly abhor those Israeli policies and attitudes that are abusive towards the Palestinians/Gazans. Given that, however, there  *is no comparison* between the reality of the Warsaw Ghetto and in  Gaza.    Just as international law recognizes the right of the occupying  entity to maintain order, especially in the face of elements that are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil structure.  Ironically, international law recognizes each of these focusses (that of the occupied and the occupier) even though they are  inherently in conflict.  Israel certainly cannot, and should not, continue its present policies towards Gazan residents. There is, however, a third  alternative- the creation and implementation of a jewish \\\"dhimmi\\\" system with Gazans/Palestinians as benignly \\\"protected\\\" citizens. Would you find THAT as acceptable in that form as you do with regard to Islam's policies towards its minorities?    It is a race, then? Between Israel's anti-Palestinian/Gazan \\\"Final Solution\\\" and the Arab World's anti-Israel/jewish \\\"Final Solution\\\". Do you favor one? neither?   Since there is justifiable worry by various parties that Israel and Arab/Palestinian \\\"final solution\\\" intentions exist, isn't it important that BOTH Israeli *and* Palestinian/Gazan \\\"rights\\\" be secured?  \",\" Enemy?  Sounds like that's the viewpoint of the stereotypical rednecked conservative -- 'always been commies, always will be.'  I suggest you listen very carefully to the stuff Yeltsin and his people are saying and compare that with the very anti-West slogans coming from his opponents in the Russian congress.  I sure know who I want to back.  Oh, BTW, Germany has sure come back as a terrible enemy after WWII, hasn't it?  Better to let them degenerate into civil war?  Remember all those nuclear weapons in Russia.  I cannot imagine that they would not be used in a civil war.  If nationialists take over and, even if they prevent a civil war, most feel they must take back large parts of land that are in other countries (like Ukraine.)  I also cannot imagine Ukraine giving up land without a fight, possibly nuclear.  How does this affect us?  Well, we are on the same planet and if vast tracks of Europe are blown away I think we'd feel something. A massive breakup of a country that spans 1/6th the planet is bound to have affects here.  (Of course, there is also the humanitarian argument that democracies should help other democracies (or struggling democracies).)   Seriously.  Everyone has different opinions on what is stupid. My two \\\"causes\\\" are aid to Russia and a strong space program. Someone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies of drunken goldfish.  That is why we have a republic and not a true democracy.  Instead of gridlock on a massive scale, we only have gridlock on a congressional scale.  BTW, who is to decide 'stupid?'  This is just like those who want to impose their 'morals' on others -- just the sort of thing I thought Libertarians were against.  Actually, my politics are pretty Libertarian except on this one issue  and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party.  It seems that Libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and let it sink or swim.  We could do that 100 years ago but not now.

What defines a fundamentalist (Not who!!!!!!!!!). That is an essential question which nobody has agreed upon an answer, at least to what literature / discussion / news i've seen.. \",\" One rule of thumb is that if a person is making the claim, they are wrong.  I was just reading John 14 this morning (I think that is the right chapter, anyway it is close and I don't have a Bible at work to check with.) and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about his impending death and he says that he will be going away and then later he will be with them.  He said something along the lines of \\\"I will be in you and you will be in me.\\\"  (Again I cannot provide the exact quote or citation.)  Anyway, my understanding of this is that the Second Coming will not be an outward event.  It is an inward event, Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him. If you look for a person you will be deceived.  It seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that would be a political or military leader and so didn't recognize Jesus when he came.  Jesus tried to show that his Kingdom was not of this earth. A lot of what I have seen written about the Second Coming seems to based on an expectation of Christ coming back and finally taking over the world and running it the way it should be.  It sounds a lot like what the Jews were looking for.  The First Coming wasn't like that and I see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that either.  Oh and by the way, I don't expect it to happen once.  There is no one Second Coming, there are a lot of little ones.  Every time Christ comes into someones heart, Christ has come again.

Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois. EnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in matters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our environment.   Incorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and initial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to Critz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and Objectives:                              MISSION      It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members    to foster and implement the improved education of young    people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards    of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition    than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,    moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue    the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall    seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the    separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,    improvement, and responsible use of the environment in    which we must all live.                            OBJECTIVES      In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary    objectives shall be:        (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many             environmentally concerned organizations as             possible, said Movement having as its primary             focus the education and participatory             involvement of young people in appropriate areas             of environmental concern;        (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and             their branches a full complement of program             materials for their use, including suitable             uniforms, insignia and other badges, written             ideas, syllabi and information, literature and             other items as shall seem appropriate and             desirable;        (3)  To serve as a \\\"clearing house\\\" for the exchange             of program ideas, materials and information             among said organizations;  and        (4)  To assist environmentally concerned             organizations to recruit and train the necessary             adult leadership for their youth programs.   EnviroLeague will operate through three \\\"Program Divisions\\\" serving youth in the elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be through formation of \\\"EnviroLeague Teams,\\\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by environmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a charter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.   EnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders of each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to membership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper conduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain additional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such organizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as possible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to youth membership.   EnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to contribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its Teams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any local administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be involved in similar functions at the national level.   Program materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \\\"draft\\\" portions of the Mentor's Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the EARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes place.   CompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague's founder chose this electronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation. This announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH Forums.   The electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe's Earth Forum - GO EARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \\\"EnviroLeague.\\\" ============================================================================   Subsequently, EnviroLeague's Initial Governance Council has held its first meeting.

It turns out that my recollections were pretty darn accurate, at least as far as the Phillies record goes. On September 1 1964 this was the top of the N.L. standings:                   W     L    GB Philadelphia    79    51    - Cincinnati      74    57    5 1/2 St. Louis       72    59    7 1/2 San Francisco   73    60    7 1/2  This is a game-by-game description of the remainder of the Phillies' season:  Date  Score Opponent        Lead      Pitcher (starting and winner/loser) 9/1   4-3   Houston         5 1/2     Bunning (15-4) 9/2   2-1   Houston         5 1/2     Short (15-7) 9/3   0-6   Houston         5 1/2     Bennett (9-12) 9/4   5-3   San Francisco   6 1/2     Mahaffey; Baldschun (6-5) 9/5   ??Win San Francisco   6 1/2     Bunning (16-4) 9/6   3-4   San Francisco   5 1/2     Short; Baldschun (6-6) 9/7   5-1   Los Angeles               Bennett (10-12)       1-3   Los Angeles     6 1/2     Wise (5-3) 9/8   2-3   Los Angeles     6         Mahaffey (12-7) 9/9 5-10/11 St. Louis       5         Bunning; Baldschun (6-7)             (Cardinals take over 2nd place from Cincinnati) 9/10  5-1   St. Louis       6         Short (16-7) 9/11  1-0   San Francisco   6         Bennett (11-12) 9/12  1-9   San Francisco   6         Mahaffey (12-8)             (Giants move into a tie for 2nd with St. Louis) 9/13 4-1/10 San Francisco   6         Bunning (17-4)             (Cardinals back in sole possesion of 2nd place) 9/14  4-1   Houston         6 1/2     Short (17-7) 9/15  1-0   Houston         6         Bennett (12-12) 9/16  5-6   Houston         6         Bunning (17-5) 9/17  4-3   Los Angeles     6 1/2     Wise; Schantz (2-4) 9/18  3-4   Los Angeles     6         Short; Baldschun (6-8) 9/19 3-4/16 Los Angeles     5 1/2     Bennett; Baldschun (6-9) 9/20  3-2   Los Angeles     6 1/2     Bunning (18-5)             (Reds move back into tie for 2nd with Cardinals)  Well so far so good for the Phillies.

And the final standings were:                   W     L    GB St. Louis       93    69    - Philadelphia    92    70    1 Cincinnati      92    70    1 San Francisco   90    72    3  Now it doesn't appear to me that Phillies pitchers Bunning and Short were really overused, at least by the four-man rotation standard of the day, until well along into the 10-game losing streak, at which time Mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the Phillies substantial lead had evaporated. The way they were used at that time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched a complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It would be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league. Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1 through October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games than the other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that stretch. \",\"  Brian K., I am pleased with your honesty.  And to be honest as well, I believe you have not asked my god to come to you.  Why do I say this? Because by the things you write on the net, and the manner with which you write them, you show me that you made up your own god and are attempting to pass him off as the real thing.  I got news for you. Yours doesn't at all sound like mine.  Your god doesn't come to you because your god doesn't exist.   I am sorry Brian, but when I read your postings, I do not see an open mind. What I do see is misunderstanding, lack of knowledge, arrogance and mockery.   Be true to yourself then.  Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain  knowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the Bible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and there exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond our shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself   to seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a person who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find  something to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one will gain with that attitude is folly.  Be careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages in the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even though they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not. Be assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such deep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied.  I will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, \\\"You will never be thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.\\\"   From King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):      \\\"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;      to search out a matter is the glory of kings.\\\"   Jesus says in John 6:44 & 55:     \\\"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\\\"   And in John 3:16:     \\\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,    that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal    life.\\\"   You are included in \\\"whosoever\\\".  And I also pray that the Father is drawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting to talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the making.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure stoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became on of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.  You see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because you could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack Christians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul, proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.  Or you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would  probably say to you: \\\"Satan would surely like to have you.\\\"  Why so? Because Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great moments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task he did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the faith to walk on water as Jesus did.  You asked \\\"Why not believe in Zeus?\\\"  Zeus didn't offer eternal life. You got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus. \",\"    In Texas, you cannot carry a handgun.  Period.  Either concealed or open. And your numbers are misleading; they include suicides and accidents.

An On/Off Road Rally consists of the following:     1. An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of       directions and clues guiding participates around the        Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course       based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will       be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which       they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the       number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately        lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is        set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points       will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions       or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,       basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.     2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants       will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.       Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles       without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half       the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle       unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will       divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified       4x4s can run the course.         At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring   participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.   Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.  * This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles   so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be   street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section   of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper   from their vehicle :) .

I know what you mean!  I glow everytime Ronnie's out on the ice. In fact, one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in person is that I can key in on him instead of watching what I'd probably be seeing on tv.  He does so many subtle things behind the play.  He said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad stressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have to learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took that advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrived in Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldn't and wouldn't play a lick of defense.  It's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought all of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he has certainly helped, and even ol' Kjell has been steady.  But looking at this team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-up permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it wouldn't matter.  If I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would be 1) Tom Barrasso; 2) Ron Francis; 3) Larry Murphy.  (I'd love to put Francis first but I do think the only thing that could really damage the Pens right now would be to lose Barrasso.)\",\"un, you better add at least another plus to the Pederson for Neely trade, the Bruins also received a number 1 round draft pick, didn't play great this year but Wesley's still a decent defenseman....

That is why the ADL monitors Arab organizations.  That is the same reason the US monitored communist organizations and Soviet nationals only a few years ago.     All of these groups have, in the past, associated with or been a part of anti- Israel activity or propoganda.  The ADL is simply monitoring them so that if anything comes up, they won't be caught by surprise.    No, that is why World Trade Center bombings don't happen in Israel (aside from the fact that there is no world trade center) and why people like Zein Isa ( Palestinian whose American group planned to bow up the Israeli Embassy and  \\\"kill many Jews.\\\") are caught.  As Mordechai Levy of the JDL said, Paranoid Jews live longer.    They probably do.\",\" The Cold War has not ended.  The only thing that has happened is that  the two sides have exchanged roles.  The USA has a higher imprisonment rate (400 per 100,000 population) than any country in Europe by a factor of 10 or so.  In California, it is over 600 per 100,000 population.  The prison population in California is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980.  Most of these inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws.  Police now confiscate property, without trial, under a \\\"good faith probable cause\\\" standard, in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drug dealers of their ill-gotten gains.  Conduct an opinion poll, and a majority will answer \\\"yes\\\" if you ask them whether civil liberties and due process should be diluted in order to Send Our Young People The Message That We Are Serious About Winning The War On Drugs.  I don't know whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners, but I would expect the same result.  They certainly seem to vote that way.  According to Jack Herer's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_, over TWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under the marijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their own business and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselves than users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year).  Under the \\\"War on Drugs\\\" campaign of \\\"zero tolerance\\\" due process protections have eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have proliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicians who favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not only legal, but political:  \\\"My fellow Americans, we must send our young people the message that we are serious about winning the War On Murder\\\"--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun prohibition laws.  Gun owners are about to get a taste of the medicine they voted for believing it would be used only on those with different tastes in recreational drugs.  What goes around comes around. \",\" :   I have normal procomm plus for dos, but I've been considering buying : the windows version....it got really great reviews in computer shopper. : I have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here : using it, but the screen seems to have a problem keeping up with the : modem....he has a 14,400 modem on a 486 50 Mhz machine.  I can't : see it having trouble keeping up.  His pcplus for dos works great,  re: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93  This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2 or DOS apps not running under Windows.  One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that their RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST) discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or FAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer than with the old 2400bps modem.   There are three reasons for the problem:  1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most    PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the    operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high    interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and    the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded    environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.  2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and    interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely    than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you    are losing data, you may be advised that \\\"you need to upgrade to a    16550\\\". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance    about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the    store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve    my own problem had never heard the term \\\"16550\\\" and many didn't even    know what a UART was.  3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade    your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience    errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers    don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this    regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications    like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem    by themselves.  If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem card.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they are to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one. Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.   The Hardware Situation.  The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250 or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace them).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft diagnostic program \\\\WINDOWS\\\\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before* bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.  The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to 460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access cycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info, see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.  So, what UART component do you have?  Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM board or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with the numbers \\\"8250\\\" or \\\"16450\\\", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI, and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE your VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket COM board.  If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The \\\"N\\\" chip is the normal 40-pin dual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550 chips without the \\\"A\\\" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).  Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various IC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips: National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552 Chips&Technology:       82C607 Texas Instruments:      t16c550a Silicon Systems:        73M550 VLSI                    16C550 TurboCom warns about the pre-\\\"A\\\" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550, says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70 systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).  If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after- market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you may be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to either disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to COM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).  Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology MCT-AIO+ card from:  JDR Microdevices 2233 Samaritan Drive San Jose  CA  95124 (800) 538-5000 voice US (408) 559-1200 voice other (800) 538-5005 FAX US  The MCT-AIO+ (and the \\\"+\\\" is important) sells for $89.95.

Meanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports, and am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based 8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set the internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.   The Software Situation  Simply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun problems.  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the 16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1 drivers have the following limitations:  - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.  - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt    rate of 10x during uploads.  - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2    more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).  - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.    With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1    or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would    be effective.  - The API won't accept rates above \\\"CBR_128000\\\".  - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even    if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit    from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.  - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.  - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.  - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port    speed options above 19200 bps.  These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0). Rumors suggest they \\\"may\\\" be solved in Windows \\\"4.0\\\".  You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of \\\"TurboCom\\\", current version 1.2, from:  Bio-Engineering Research Pacific CommWare Division 180 Beacon Hill Lane Ashland  OR   97520-9701 (503) 482-2744 voice (503) 482-2627 FAX (503) 482-2633 BBS MCImail:    344-5374 CompuServe: 71521,760  Price was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit cards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom but as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software company per se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for an in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a market for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They recently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.  I now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my datacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps when linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O. Uploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts are still using antique UARTs and drivers.  Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the Windows APIs and dialog boxes.  I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you do the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC) standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another 16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving system or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all by itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above 115,200 may still be risky.  Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to buy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a 16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of TurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of \\\"Windows Sources\\\" magazine. I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a \\\"power user\\\" whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems.   Closing Soapbox Comments  The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface, the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation vendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was subsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the exception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent I/O.  You may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this situation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect cries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs \\\"sort of\\\" work today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a hardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that use that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.

This morning about 6:00, the feds punched holes in the compound walls by using a tank.  They  then started using non-lethal tear gas.  Shortly after noon, 2 cult members were seen setting fire to the compound.  So far, about 20-30 people have been seen outside the compound.  The fate of the other 60 or 70 people is unknown, neither is the fate of the 17 children that were inside.  The compound did burn to the ground.  Koresh, who at times has claimed to be the Messiah, but then backed off and only claimed to be a prophet, had promised several times to come out peacefully if his demands were met.  First, he demanded that his message be broadcast on the radio, which it was, but he didn't come out. He claimed to be waiting for a message from God.  Finally, he said that God told him that he needed to decipher the mystery of the 7 seals in Revelation, and when he was finished, he'd come out.  He finished the first one, but didn't do any more work that anyone knows of since then. The federal agents did warn him that if they didn't come out, they  would be subjected to tear gas.  I think it's really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere man, even if he did claim to be the son of God, and/or a prophet.

I thought I'd post it to stir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by saying that I largely agree that the \\\"Space Age\\\" in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \\\"What's New\\\" - the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of matter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I think, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \\\"mind children\\\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but I think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do *now*.     Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...   SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW  Micheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)  At 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis.  The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no longer define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion -dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards.    Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's science and technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy.    To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead.  .....  Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion to build space station Freedom alone.  Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains, Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken public champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much.  Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar space budgets.  Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.    ......  While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel Goldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's technological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been slashed.

I've been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties with Christianity. It is surprising to note that a large majority of people, at least in Finland, seem to be apatheists - even though 90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland, religious people are actually a minority.   Could it be possible that many people believe in god \\\"just in case\\\"? It seems people do not want to seek the truth; they fall prey to Pascal's Wager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believe reads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn't care - it believes, but doesn't know what or how.   People don't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle, they only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say that they are not \\\"born in the Spirit\\\", but this does not disturb them. Religion is not something to think about.   I'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless -  a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to. Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop, too many people take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow (and unconsciously hope god wouldn't notice ;-) )  : Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a : higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The : typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the : same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the : other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn : somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core, : than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it : expresses its own selfishness.  If logic and reason are valued, then I would claim that atheistic thinking is of higher value than the theistic exposition. Theists make unnecessary assumptions they believe in - I've yet to see good reasons to believe in gods, or to take a leap of faith at all. A revelation would do.  However, why do we value logic and reasoning? This questions bears some resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science: why mathematics works? Strong deep structuralists, like Atkins, have proposed that perhaps, after all, everything _is_ mathematics.   Is usefulness any criterion?  Petri \",\"     Fortunately, wire-wrapping is a better wiring technique than most at high frequencies; Cray computers (up to the X-MP, at least) all had wirewrapped backplanes.  Wirewrap gets into trouble at much higher frequencies than any TTL can handle.  The 'increase' of wiring capacitance is not really relevant (you have to use transmission line techniques, and the capacitance is no problem).     Hand-powered is a terrible choice (IMHO) unless you are a field maintenance person who will do maybe a dozen connections at a time.  Your hands will cramp.  Battery-powered wire-wrap guns are available in the $150 range, and so are the little twiddle-stick manual types ($15).  For a modest project, of a couple hundred connections, I'd prefer to borrow a professional AC unit... or a pneumatic one.\",\" excellent question timothy. i hpoe the answers you get will be satisfactory   as we can not understand the mind of god. but to attempt to answer you   clearly. GOD of the Bible has given us humans relativly little about how he   intends to judge mankind. the first test is those who have beleived that Jesus   Christ is the Son of GOD and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to   serve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god,   the bible calls this sin. for those who die before the end of the world/have   already died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche.   God must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world. however   there is no plus and minus system for GOD. he has declared that he can not   tolerate spiritual imperfection, thus he can only based your worthiness to   live with him on the wrong in your life.    Good people, yes even Christians are going to constantly sin before GOD, The   Christian hoever thanks GOD that Christ has given his life for his sin's   penalty. the proscribed punishment for sin is death, just as the proscribed   punishment for robbery is time in jail. God then cannot ask for anything but   punishement for those sins. He does not want to condem. the Bible says in John   3:17, that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that   through him it might be saved.\\\" when i realize that i have sinned, and i do   with painful regularity, i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin   against me, i have that right and privlige only because of Christ. as for Jews   they are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come, and   dis come in Jesus of Nazereth. Muslims, i fear have been given a lie from the   fater of lies, Satan. They need Christ as do us all.   for those who don't have that right, in the view of the bible they stand   olone in their defense. are you going to hell? i can not answer that for you.   i can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to   Hell? that step is much more rewarding.  stan toney stoney@oyster.smcm.edu my opinions are my own, you may borrow them\",\"Koc) responded to article <1993Apr22.152937.14766@urartu.sdpa.org> dbd@urartu.  [DD]  Problem 1 [DD] [DD] My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the  [DD] Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed  [DD] extraordinary heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the  [DD] Persian troops. The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army.  [DD] The second time, pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the  [DD] soldiers. The third time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army.  [DD] The Persians who were still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to  [DD] Nakhichevan. And so, from this remainder, find how many Persian soldiers  [DD] there were before the massacre.  [Koc] Answer: a(1-1/2-1/4-1/11)=280 -> a = 1760  Good for you! You win the prize -- a free trip to Karabakh as an Azeri  soldier! Now, calculate the odds of you coming back after trying to de-populate the area of Armenians!  [Koc] Corollary: Armenians strike, slaughter, destroy, and massacre. After [Koc] all, they are not as innocent as the asala network claims.  Fact: I didn't notice any mention of Turks in Shirak, Van, or Trebizon in       this seventh century story!  Fact: These places were filled with Armenians as of 1915.  Fact: By the end of 1916, after the Turkish genocide of the Armenians, there       were no Armenians left in Shirak, Van, or Trebizon -- only Turks and       Kurds! In fact, there were no Pontus Greeks left alive in Trebizon        either!  Conclusion: Numbers don't lie in either case!   \",\"To what follows, our moderator has already answered the charge of  arrogance more ably that I could have done so, so I will confine myself to answering the charge of illogic.     This is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is, or was, taught to think. It is the fundamental premis \\\"A is not not-A\\\". If a thing is true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic  asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word \\\"believe\\\", however. The weak sense means I am not sure. \\\"I believe Tom went to  the library.\\\" (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense means I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. \\\"I believe  that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws.\\\" (despite  the fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian belief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological  topics.)    Note that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the  majority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that if Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be false, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity.  (And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)    It is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless  they have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks and wants.   Most Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living tradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly by the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.   If depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we  may both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive that he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.    Thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being  can find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find  absolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who does not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.   Here I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the knowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass  is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half full: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole point of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist and the optimist express the *same* fact.)   It is, of course, quite true that different people may express the  same belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail to understand each other's words as expressions of the same belief and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great scisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal agreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs are equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict some other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have been stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must, **necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical to say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct,  but if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as long as we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other  as in error.\",\"I agree totally with you!

The modern analog is governments.

To a considerable extent, Englishmen also had those rights.  Yes, times change, and technology changes.  The possibility of  a few governments enserfing all of mankind was not possible until quite recently.  In the feudal system, the lord was almost as restricted as the serfs, so having the people enserf themselves does not make anything better; most feudal lords, and even most slaveowners, did not mistreat those under them.

Roger, on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his was a \\\"jingoistic rant\\\", but you also supported the name-changing on the grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals they represent. FWIW, I do not think the flaming was warranted, nor do I  think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all.  Just an  observation...  However, that aside, the real question is whether you like the idea of changing the names based on the reasons given for it (making it easier for the 'casual fan'), or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names based on individuals who do deserve the honour.  IMO, the latter is a nice and unique touch that differs from other sports.  In addition, I do not think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of people that are interested in hockey, so it's a pointless exercise anyway.  If the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not  central to the original article.  Something to consider additionally is whether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport' would have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to play in.  In this case, honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed to builders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken-and-egg type question. (although it was the chicken.....)

I thought I would post an article I  found in the Saturday, April 17, 1993 Toronto Star:                     'CLIPPER CHIP' to protect privacy  Politics is of course Dirty Pool, old man, and here we have a classic example: the NSA and the administration have been working on this for a *long* time, and in parallel with the announcement to us techies, we see they're hitting the press with propoganda.  It's my bet the big magazines - Byte, Scientific American, et all - will be ready to run with a pre-written government-slanted story on this in the next issue.  ('Just keep us some pages spare boys, we'll give you the copy in time for the presses')  We *must* get big names in the industry to write well argued pieces against this proposal (can you call it that when it's a de facto announcement?) and get them into the big magazines before too much damage is done.  It would be well worth folks archiving all the discussions from here since the day of the announcement to keep all the arguments at our fingertips.  I think between us we could write quite a good piece.  Now, who among us carries enough clout to guarantee publication?  Phil? Don Parker?  Mitch Kapor?\",\"I have read numerous posts over a period of several months, by this anti-Israel fanatic, hiding in the shadow of the respectable sounding name of the 'Center for Policy Research.'  Obviously, it is no research center of any kind, unless 'researching' published documents to find material to use against Israel makes it so.       Labeling a propaganda mill a research center is not surprising in itself.  That is simply part of the propaganda process.  I was curious if anyone knew who this anti-Israel fanatic hiding behind his phoney 'research center' name is.  Is he an Arab?  Is he some typical anti-semite hiding behind a veneer of 'anti-zionism?'  Is he some Jew who perhaps lived in Israel and just couldn't make it there, and is now taking his failure out on Israel?  \",\"  But you haven't taken into the account of propoganda.  Remember, if you asked Germans before WWII if the Jews shoudl be slaughtered, they would probably answer no, but, after the propoganda machine rolled through, at least some were able to tolerate it.  You see, it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general frenzy.   Well, they haven't managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity of the courts.  But, they have managed to create quite a few problems for people that wanted to have an abortion.  They could create similar problems for us.  And, it could be worse.  They can try to stop abortions by blocking clinics, etc., but imagine what they'd have to do to stop atheism.   So, you are able to convince them individually, but could you convince a whole room of them?  A whole nation?   Yes, I'd be glad if it were gone to.  I've never supported it.  However, I think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored, contrasted with what *could* happen (an what may be likely).   Well, I am not clear on the religious convictions of Francis Scott Key (the motto can be attributed to him), but it is at least clear that he believed in a god.  And, surely there are a few Christians that think as you say, but I don't think that most do.  Do you think that all Christians actively despise other religions?  Most that I have met haven't and don't do so.   Well, I have asked a Hindu, Moselem, and a few Jews, and all of them think that it is applicable to them.  Of course, I can't say that these people (just some that I know pretty well) are accurate representations of their faiths.   Well, I'd really like to, and I've tried, but I really don't know where to get access to _Congressional Records_ from the 1950's.  Can anyone help out here?   Only in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs.    So, are you saying that they redesign the plates each year?  Anyway, your whole argument (conveniently deleted I see) was that the motto somehow costs us all a lot of money.  This is just not correct.   That is to say, the religion of this country, and the non-religion of the USSR.  That was what most of those quotes were about, and some included all atheists, in general, as well.  I don't think that any of the quotes (although I seem to have lost them) mentioned anything at all about Jesus. They advocated religion over non-religion.  A specific religion was not mentioned.   So, you are saying that all Christians must believe that all other religions should be outlawed, just because they think they are wrong?  That's silly. I think the Flat-Earthers are wrong, but I don't advocate their banishment.   I think that any such cost would be insignificant.  I mentioned the slight cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by being on our currency.   Well, mottos in general don't really have purposes...  I don't think it should be removed because I think the benefit would be outweighed by the consequences.   Then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress.   Why not?  It is the majority that put it there.   But do they remember the debate surrounding the motto?  Do they remember that some people intended it to be a message against atheists?  Why don't you include this in your little survey that you were conducting?  [...]  What?  Should I ask some scientists the probability that something Einstein said about relativity is worthy?  I mean, if Einstein said it, there's a good chance that it was right (at least at the time).   You need not agree with them all of the time, but you would certainly think that their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point.   No, I think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a Supreme Court Justice to testify before Congress during the consideration of a Constitutional Amendment.  And, in order for the Court to rule on something, a case usually must be presented.   Yes, some mushrooms can be planted.  And, I don't appreciate mushrooms on my pizza, either.   Who was forced to put the motto there?  What do you mean?\",\"Well, the temp file thing creates an obvious problem: it is impossible to use cview for viewing CD-ROM based picture collections.

As for wavelength, I think you're primarily going to find two - 880 nM +/- a bit, and/or 950 nM +/- a bit.  Usually it is about 10 nM either way.  The two most common I have seen were 880 and 950 but I have also heard of 890 and 940. I'm not sure that the 10 nM one way or another will make a great deal of difference.   Another suggestion - find a brand of TV that uses an IR remote, and go look at the SAMS photofact for it.  You can often find some very detailed schematics and parts list for not only the receiver but the transmitter as well, including carrier freq. specs. and tone decoding specs. if the system uses that.\",\"What would all of you out there in net land think of the big 6 (Martin Mariatta, Boeing, Mcdonell Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed, Rockwell) getting together, and forming a consortium to study exactly what the market price pints are for building reusable launch vehicles, and spending say $3million to do that.  Recognizing that most of the military requirements for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say, has the shuttle  ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability?  You get the idea, figure out how many, how often, where to, etc...)  Then taking this data, and forming a sematech type company (bad example, I know... but at least its an example...)  To develop between 3 and 5 craft designs.  Then to take all of those designs, and figure out EXACTLY what the technologies are, and demonstrate those technologies, in order to  eliminate designs that can't be built today.  And lets say that this portion again funded by the GOV cost about $20 million.  And from here all of these companies went their separate ways, with the intention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wall street, and saying \\\"I want to build this vehicle, and here are the numbers that show %20 ROI, fund me...)   Now many of you think that this is a joke, but I have it on good authority that just this project is shaping up in the background. It seems that the aerospace companies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different things ends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled (NASP, NLS, ALS, DCY?, etc...)  They need to work more in the japaneese, and european spirit of initial cooperation.  They have also learned that design requirements that are phony (I.E. some generals idea of what a space vehicle ought to be) ends up getting chopped up in congress, because it is not a REAL requirement.

The observations were executed as        scheduled, and no problems were reported.       o Observations were made using the High Speed Photometer of the Planet        Uranus during an occultation by a faint star in Capricornus. These        observations will help in our understanding of the planet's        atmospheric radiative and dynamical processes.

In terms of how likely are you to be killed, (regardless of how it's done, 'cause DEAD is DEAD), the UK has a higher homicide rate. Period.  You are more likely to be killed in the UK than in Switzerland.  If you were to be murdered with a handgun, then yes, Switzerland has a higher rate.

The add was placed in the ..... cartoon section! The perfect place for it ! :-)\",\"As the Sharks' season came to a close tonight, I will start a series of posts, trying to revisit the players, the trades, the moves, etc., that went through for the Sharks for the past season.  If you are uninterested, since I will have the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can kill them.  I will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course, are subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as possible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks and/or did not play for another NHL team this season.  Thus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...  #1 BRIAN HAYWARD  Season: 11th Acquired: '91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  P (D)  It is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that featured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and '89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing grade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this year, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would not be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.  But Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first ever victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames. As he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.  #30 JEFF HACKETT  Season: 3rd Acquired: '91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft Grade:  C  Hackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply wasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles, almost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save percentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to bench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry the team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early injury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor, but upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next year.  #31 WADE FLAHERTY  Season: 1st (still eligible as rookie) Acquired: '91-92, signed as undrafted free agent Grade:  I (A-)  It is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the incomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary Flames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started the season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades' owner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP honors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he tries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs Irbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up all-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can share the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor Robins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he may not ever.  #32 ARTURS IRBE  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  B+  I may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that he's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has provided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting the team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26. He has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and making passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the goonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do with such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for a playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named as a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.\",\"I have the following Genesis/Megadrive games for sale or trade for other Genesis/MD (or SNES games).

Then they may repeat it over and over again bu you still have to pretend its funny even though it isn't any more. Once they are older than six you expect them to realise that doing the same thing over and over again isn't funny any more.  Basicaly Ed fails to be amusing because he is merely crass. He does not make jokes that have any political content beyond attempting to ridicule their target. Calling someone Slick Willie is not funny even if you put on a red nose while you say it, it was a good debating point used on the spur of the moment 12 months ago but now its use merely demonstrates that the user couldn't think of anything original to say.   In the UK there is a tradition of old retired Colnels who bore the dinner guests rigid with their descriptions of old campagns. Ed is clearly one of this type of people who fails to see when a joke is spent.  \",\"  Because, the x-Soviet Armenian government got away with the genocide  of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the  fruits of that genocide.

Excuse me?   \\\"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as    ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work    of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village.    Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts    into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable    and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets    completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They    found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border    into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole    length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to    Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain    plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of    Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for    howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the    scattered bones of the dead.\\\"                                Ohanus Appressian                             \\\"Men Are Like That\\\"                                    p. 202.   A genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an  attempt to exterminate a race. This is the worst crime in history.  It happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian  dictatorship. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst  ways imaginable. It is sickening to think that the human race is capable  of such actions, but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian  genocide of 2.5 million Muslims happened.  People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were  killed in the Turkish genocide. I understand their anger that there  are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place,  despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million Turks has been  well documented over the past six decades. We cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race.

Mark Alan Epstein, 'The Ottoman Jewish Communities and their Role   in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries,' Klaus Schwarz Werlag,   Freiburg (1980).    page 19:   <<During the fifteenth century, when the Ottomans were struggling to   reestablish themselves in the Balkans, there was considerable turmoil   among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe. Even if   the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the   fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which   Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the   Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the   realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution   in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews   fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that   the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that   there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and   eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the   effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and   persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection   of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,   was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>>     page 21:    <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official   in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi   Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and   the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation   of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from   Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two   recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom   of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European   coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.   This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant   conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of   travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who   would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*)     page 41:   <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were  firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them  and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians  of Europe.   Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is  also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews  as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.  Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians  representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European  sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition  it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,''  their  sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who  regularly reported to the Ottomans.   There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans  in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances  of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited  instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the  early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy  for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman  document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some  Greek towns...>>   page 43:    <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally  accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,  and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of  the situation.>>    page 46:   <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not  particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common  interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition  which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If  there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between  religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was  that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with  the Orthodox.>>   page 46:   <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context  during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of  interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed  Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already  existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish  response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian  countries to Ottoman domains.>>   page 151:    <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the   Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would   characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,   in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and   the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions   elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the   Jews recognized their mutual interests...>>    page 161:    <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success   of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success   in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both   cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough   to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success   without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve   the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear   that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable   partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived.   We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their   success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the   Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries   the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>>   (*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati's [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw:    page 32:    <<Your cries and sobs reached us. We have been told of all the troubles   and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear   the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly   oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and   prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob   and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They   wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren, to the counsel I will   give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German   rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land,   which is blessed by God and filled with all good things. Here I found rest   and happiness; Turkey can also become for you the land of peace...If you   who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with   in this land, you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out   to come to us...Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain   of. We possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. We are   not oppressed with heavy taxes, and our commerce is free and unhindered.   Rich are the fruits of the earth. Everything is cheap, and every one of us   lives in peace and freedom. Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow   hat as a badge of shame, as is the case in Germany, where even wealth and   great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy   among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him   to rob him of his gold. Arise my brethren, gird up your loins, collect   your forces, and come to us. Here you will be free of your enemies, here   you will find rest...>>[13]  [13] Israel Zinberg, A History Of Jewish Literature. vol.V.

I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such \\\"storys\\\" about them. OK ? Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:    -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.          It has an hightech \\\"boiler\\\" but the rest is still verry verry           conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-          powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.          If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find          a chapter about the \\\"CARNOT-process\\\" which describes how to          get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason          for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an          temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one           side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water          again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the           energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to          let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \\\"cold\\\"          steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.          And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of          energy that carnot will give them.          The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !          The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,          because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in          AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent          radioactive pollution of the environment !              -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-          Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still          verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere          around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with          the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the          metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.          This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures          up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental.      -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever          possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the          years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem          at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have          1.5 mRem.

Could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of  Israel right after it was formed.     No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity. Palestinians are no exception. Perhaps you heard about anti-trust in the business world.  Since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law says that, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of investing, you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly, the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate. They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.  The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic / multi-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours was no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair market value, etc... They did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist myself, but this one is hard to dismiss).     Again Adam, the devil is in the details. I don't want to get on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its OK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest. Because 100 is a nice number that you can devide by 10, 100 and besides, it has an integer square root.    Do you actually believe this? My experience tells me that every palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home, in Palestine. Besides they often refer to their exodus as an escape from hell (so to speak). I know none that agrees with you. Did you sample their opinions? I know you don't care, just being rethorical.     Don't get me wrong. I beleive that Israel is democratic within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews). Israel probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic cleansing Serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the international community, or make the best out of a no win condition: show the world how good Israel is towards the 'bad' arabs. Personaly, I've never heard anything about the arab community in Isreal. Except that they're there.  So yes, they're there. But as a community with history and roots, its dead.

Be careful when you apply the white tape to the rubber carriage roller, it tells the scanner where the edge is and it can come off.  Jim \",\" I attribute my success to several factors:  Very low fat.  Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me, I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.  Very little sugar or salt.  Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are recommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard of people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are just too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)  My \\\"clean your plate\\\" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last 10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch up, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.  I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry shortly, and eating won't be practical then).  I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to stores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car. I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps build and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes runs in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable with a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if it drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess ounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim weight from the rider than from the vehicle.)  There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately, it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.  Obviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've done will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who did try it and didn't succeed.   I'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat. I usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty, my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.

X X XGOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X    * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X    * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X XRULES: X X    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules: X X    1) Your entry must be a complete program. X X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters X       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or } X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536. X X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format: X X---entry--- Xrule: 1993 Xfix: y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry) Xtitle: title of entry        (see comments below) Xentry: Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0) Xdate: Date/time of submission in UTC     (see comments below) Xhost: Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested X Use tab indented lines if needed X---remark--- X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th X    column.  Blank lines are permitted. X---author--- Xname: your name Xorg: School/Company/Organization Xaddr: postal address X use tab indented lines to continue X don't forget to include the country Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain. X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines. Xanon: y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info) X---info--- XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section. X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2. X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X * The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X   and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X   It is suggested, but not required, that the title should X   incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors, X   consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X * The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X   to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()  X   using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X * You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X   it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the  X   ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same  X   title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be  X   sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X * With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above  X   format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X   something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate X   Email message to the judges. X X * Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless  X   'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X * To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X   each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X   should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X * The entry's remarks should include: X     - what this program does X     - how to run the program (sample args or input) X     - special compile or execution instructions, if any X     - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X     - information about any ---data--- files X     - why you think the program is obfuscated X     - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X     - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X * Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X   portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They  X   should not be required to exist. X X   If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X   section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple  X   ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X   each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: X X    'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed X    'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional X        digit, followed by '.c' X    your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X        title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not  X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to: X X  ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate X  obfuscate@toad.com X X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'. X X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however. X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC. X X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry X       must be sent in a separate Email letter. X X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.   X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed. X X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user, X       special owner or group) are not allowed. X     X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    The Judging will be done by Landon Noll and Larry Bassel.

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers  X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with  X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor  X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X * look at the original source X * convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X * run it through a C beautifier X * examine the algorithm X * lint it X * compile it X * execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting \\\"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake\\\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X #define d define X #d foo     <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X int i; X j;     <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you  X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in  X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type. X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: X X int i; X char *c; X i[c];     <--- use c[i] instead X (i+3)[\\\"string\\\"];   <--- use \\\"string\\\"[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X * assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X * casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X * passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X * passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X * performing arithmetic on va_list variables X * using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X * are very hardware specific X * are very OS or Un*x version specific X      (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X       code is likely not to be) X * dump core or have compiler warnings X      (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X * won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X * abusing the build file to get around the size limit X * obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X * are longer than they need to be X * are similar to previous winners X * are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X * are as concise and small as they need to be X * do something at least quasi-interesting X * pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X * are portable X * are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X * MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X * make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X where this program differs from the contest rules, the X contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule: 1993 Xfix: n Xtitle: chonglab Xentry: 0 Xdate: Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost: Un*x v6, pdp11/45 X 2.9BSD, pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.

Send us a version of  X   your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You  X   should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the  X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges (not the address for X judges@toad.com      submitting entries) X     X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer  X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as  X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many  X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X date -u \\\"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\\\" X date -u | sed -e 's/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/' X sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X ---entry--- section X all ---author--- sections X all ---info--- sections X ---build--- section X ---program--- section X any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X * reading the ---entry--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X * passing the source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X * performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X * passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X * linting the source X * compiling/building the source X * running the program X * performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X * best small one line program X * best small program X * strangest/most creative source layout X * most useful obfuscated program X * best game that is obfuscated X * most creatively obfuscated program X * most deceptive C code X * best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X * best abuse of ANSI C X * worst abuse of the rules X * <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry  X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,  X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X     comp.lang.c    comp.unix.wizards alt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X     comp.sources.d   alt.sources.d  misc.misc X     comp.sources.misc   comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners  X    have appeared in books (\\\"The New Hackers Dictionary\\\") and on T-Shirts.

Cheers, Kent\",\"  Jesus also recognized other holy days, like the Passover.  Acts 15 says  that no more should be layed on the Gentiles than that which is necessary. The sabbath is not in the list, nor do any of the epistles instruct people to keep the 7th day, while Christians were living among people who did not keep the 7th day.  It looks like that would have been a problem.  Instead, we have Scriptures telling us that all days can be esteemed alike (Romans 14:5) and that no man should judge us in regard to what kind of food we eat, Jewish holy days we keep, or _in regard to the sabbath. (Col. 2.)

Brian\",\"G'Day  Windows NT is a step forward, but not by much. I guess for DOS users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to  be able to use more than 64K of memory, its a major improvement. For Windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for  granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running  3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even  a real issue. My ideal operating system:   Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize  binaries and configure on the fly, so I don't have to have  bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc...   Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac   and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which   has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in   80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips.  Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems.   Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton   or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform   or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly.  so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on    my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential.   Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS  or NT or OS/2, and run shell scripts or command/BAT files.   Object oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have  to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch  or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly.  In other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight, clean kernel so you can actually understand it.

Using an expose event handler is a \\\"proper\\\" way to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is guaranteed to be mapped.  The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow \\\"tickle\\\" the Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.\",\"Note the Followup-To: header ...   On my SVR4 Amiga Unix box, I've got -lform, -lmenu, and -lpanel for use with the curses library.  Guess what they provide? :-)  Unix Press, ie.

It is ISBN 0-13-020637-7.  Paraphrased from the outside back cover:      FMLI is a high-level programming tool for creating menus, forms,     and text frames.  ETI is a set of screen management library     subroutines that promote fast development of application programs     for window, panel, menu, and form manipulation.  The FMLI is a shell package which reads ascii text files and produces screen displays for data entry and presentation.  It consists of a \\\"shell-like\\\" environment of the \\\"fmli\\\" program and it's database files.  It is section 1F in the Unix Press manual.  The ETI are subroutines, part of the 3X manual section, provide support for a multi-window capability on an ordinary ascii terminal with controls built on top of the curses library.  \",\"Hi everyone,  I thought that some people may be interested in my VR software on these groups:  *******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******  Multiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality system, primarily focused on entertainment/research.  Features:     Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.    No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).    Generic clients.    Customizable servers.    Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).    Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).    Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily         attached.  Functionality:    Client:    The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things    when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's    viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's    actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to    other users.     The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to    develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that    resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting    it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.     This release of the client software supports the following functionality:      o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)      o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)      o User Interface Panels      o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for  faster frame rates)      o Mouse and Keyboard Input     (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the    PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because    I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)    Server(s):    This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is    provided in this release for potential world server developers:      o Transparent Client Management      o Client Message Handling     This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of accepting and    terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer    can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.     Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is    what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:      o Server Selectable Extension Installation:         What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended         functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension         initialisers you want.      o Event Handler Registration:         When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback         functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.         (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)      o Collision Detection Registration:         If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide         some basic information to the collision detection management software.         Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.      This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because     the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects     from which to choose.      The following is all you need to make a World Server application:      o Provide an initWorld function:         This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus         any initialization you want to do.      o Provide a positionObject function:         This is where you determine where to place a new client.      o Provide an installWorldObjects function:         This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.      o Provide a getWorldType function:         This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.      o Provide an animateWorld function:         This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects         move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit         (to avoid outrunning the clients).      That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the     three world servers I've provided:          generic - 81 lines         dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the                            stairs! Will probably be improved with future                            versions)         dogfight - 72 lines  Location:     This software is located at the following site:    ftp.u.washington.edu     Directory:    pub/virtual-worlds     File:    multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z  Futures:     Client:      o Texture mapping.      o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading      o HMD support.      o Etc, etc....     Server:      o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).      o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction      o Etc, etc....     Both:      o Improved Comms!!!  I hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse software, unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(  I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I would *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!

BBCI was an example of an Islamically owned and operated bank - what will someone bet me they weren't \\\"real\\\" Islamic owners and operators? - and yet it actually turned out to be a long-running and quite ruthless operation to steal money from small and often quite naive depositors.  And why did these naive depositors put their life savings into BCCI rather than the nasty interest-motivated western bank down the street?   Could it be that they believed an Islamically owned  and operated bank couldn't possibly cheat them?   So please don't try to con us into thinking that it will all  work out right next time.\",\"  No. The issue is reducing crime, not guns. If gun control doesn't lower crime overall, then is doesn't address the issue.   Does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much more common? Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the threat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger using a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim  in an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may not be as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually _use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.) It isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a knife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more common. That's why it is important to look at the overall (not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of substitution, different criminal techinques of using different weapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.   \\\"Face\\\"? Possibly. However, facing knife-welding attackers isn't too common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the usual tactic. Very few criminals shoot from cover: It attracts to much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your pockets. Overall, I'd much rather be threatened with a gun than actually stabbed with a knife.   Actually, the exact same statement is true of guns: Training in unarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman  without much problem.  You also ignore the criminal's reaction: The National Crime Survey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with a knife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives in a confrontation. If faced with a serious threat, almost all prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore, using (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case) a weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless of how he is armed. Knives, however, are much less effective than guns: Criminals don't consider knifes as a \\\"serious threat\\\" nearly as often as they do guns.\",\" Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib graphics.

Currently I have   8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.   both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking   of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know   that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I   can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about   $400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,   the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that   the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather   avoid...  So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work   well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about   $90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how   do they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the   extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the   ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so   probably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly   appreciated.  -Eric\",\"  Uh Oh!

A: You would be wise not to copyprotect that program.  You see, those     people that wants to get a cracked copy of your program will go to     various length to crack your program, and some of those crackers     are good, and know the common tricks.    So, the copy protection wouldn't stop those.    Ok, then.  What about legitimate users?  Copy protection can be a hassle    for legitimate users, and can hinder them in their work, expecially    if there is some \\\"key\\\" item that can get lost.    So, the copy protection wouldn't help much of the legitimate users, but    would make life somewhat of a misery for them.

Nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation.  An  instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies.  According to  Nazi theoreticians, Gypsies were an Aryan race.  They were persecuted, and in huge numbers murdered, because most European Gypies were considered not pure Gypsies but \\\"mongrels\\\" formed from the pure Gypsy  race and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between  the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies, by the way.

Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specifically the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats) will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user, and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed.  Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate with impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from key escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means.  Because life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal very large and conspicuous property (luxury cars), it is reasonable to assume that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous property (a cipher cellular phone).  Just as we have seen in the past with \\\"blue box\\\" technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones, we can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakes criminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stolen instruments.  Because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days, a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.  There will be a continuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies.  In other words, Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, and persistent threat to the general public.  On the other hand, if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a device in a mostly non-ciphered network, the communication will at least stand out as being unusual, and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation.  Finally, because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments, there will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communications in the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is discovered, and the instruments involved have been identified).  While recording and archiving may not be feasible for wireline networks, it is probably feasible across the more limited bandwidth of radio networks.  The existence of these recordings could open up vast potential for abuse.\",\"If one reasons that the United States of America at one time represented  and protected freedom << individual liberty and personal responsibility >>  (and I do, in fact, think that this is true) and that totalitarianism <<  absolute government control and tyranny >> represents freedom's opposite  (which it does), did the USA really win the cold war?

One of the folks involved in those discussions, a spacecraft engineer named Preston Carter, passed the suggestion on to  some entreprenurial types, and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead with it.  Preston is now at LLNL, and is working with Space Marketing on  the sensors that might be carried.  Actually, that sounds unlikely.  I don't know what the launch vehicle would be, but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher -- certainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASA for, e.g.,  launch support would probably  cover NASA's incremental costs pretty well.   No, as noted, LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design, per  Clementine and related programs.  I'm sure folks around here would like to  see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure, but after all,  the U.S. did the Echo satellites long ago, and an advertising structure would not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was (or a parade balloon, for that matter).

I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to   take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive   word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS    netters will be amiable in their explanation.)  Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say \\\"no good\\\" because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not  the authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time  before I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England,  Professor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the  following as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring  1993 edition):    \\\"I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--   or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other    with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian    or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around   a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude   those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central   defining characteristic of a good American might be \\\"one who doesn't draw   exclusive circles\\\" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the    central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to   draw a circle around \\\"Mormon\\\" or \\\"Christian,\\\" to decide who is \\\"orthodox\\\"   and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider   that the central pillar of Christ's \\\"orthodoxy\\\" is our ability to love   unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.    \\\"I recently spent some time in a \\\"Christian\\\" bookstore in California. The   service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and   well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural   commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.   But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking    others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American   culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to \\\"Cults and the   Occult,\\\" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same   rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found   I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers   (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous   anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations   of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).    \\\"It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to   Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (\\\"Perfect   love casteth out fear,\\\" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the   LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a    disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the   same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive   action---as the \\\"religious right wing\\\" has launched this year against the   political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like.   It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the   very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,   if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of   others they believe to be evil.\\\"   The above \\\"sermon\\\" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe to This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His arms.    Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles  of the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim  perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do  now lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled \\\"Christian\\\", if  those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are  intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical  scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication  than mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the  majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective  voice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter  the LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths  and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to  disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves.

If most people }use scissors to cut paper, shouldn't Consumer's Reports }test scissors for paper-cutting ability, even though }scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth?  That's possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching Jewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this highly-interpreted version is what was \\\"enlightened for its times\\\". To (attempt to) extend the analogy, this is like saying that the original scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for their times, even though they only ever cut cloth, and had never even heard of paper.  I'm not arguing that the Bible is \\\"disgusting\\\", though some of the history depicted in it is, by modern standards.  However, history is full of similar abuses, and I don't think the Biblical accounts are worse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours.  On the other hand, I don't know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible shows *less* abuse than their contemporaries, or ours.  That complex and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic interpretations of that history is interesting, but I still don't think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history.\",\" I believe that was 4-1.

In keeping with more classic command and control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor.

I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens, and not multiple X displays.   Given this:   - Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple  as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's  nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between  screens?   - Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate  screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there?  What are they; who sells them...   - Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a  window frame and move a window from one screen to the next?   - Is there any way for the application to transparently see  multiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardware  only provide for each screen to start at 0,0?   - Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a  system capable of using either multiple screens or a single  screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate  multiple screens instead)?    I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely  on providing config files which will specify for each  configuration the screen placement of each window in the  application.

My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the bottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the 46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have large, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get them :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the waist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece size that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's problems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and when I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).  I can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are in some way different from us real folks.  Also, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands. I've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a store wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom in any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my sidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally leave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall down unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight), stuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit), and run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be running errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...  As far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably equal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by 3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around the waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.  So I'd have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit, I still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I own.  Wouldn't go long distance without it.

Yes, the argument can (and has) been made that current government policy creates even larger market barriers than there were in the first place, but there is no such term as 'government failure', since the government can change policies whenever it pleases.  The market doesn't do that and is governed by (relatively) well-understood forces.  This libertopican bilge about 'moral arguments' about taxation, etc., is, at bottom, so much simplistic economic thinking. It can only be 'justified' by cliche derision of anyone who knows more about economics than the libertopian -- which is what invariably happens.  Tripe a la Tommy, the new libertopian dish.    Wherever do you get this inflated idea of your own importance?  --  \\\"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live  in the real world.\\\"   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden\",\" Yep, that's pretty much it. I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the Jewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between YHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral Code to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries fall, though.  As I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was required, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that the Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of the required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).  The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between Man and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate anything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).   The trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the \\\"created in His image\\\" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and have still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if one wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors unashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about Jesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives by his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians. Revelation aside, one can only \\\"know\\\" Christ second-hand or worse.  This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way initially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible to interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where Faith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.   No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple moral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral code. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told the child that it is \\\"wrong\\\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in the pub or bar (where there are no children). The \\\"wrongness\\\" here is if the child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \\\"inappropriate\\\" to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of animals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that he is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but you get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive as absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.

Example:  The Appearances of Mary at Fatima, Portugal in 1917.   Among other things, she predicted the conversion of Russia to Atheism  (something that happened less than a year later w/ the Bolshevik  revolution).  She also predicted the second world war (that is, predicte predicted that it would occur during the papacy of a certain pope, who  was not the current one.  It happened just like she said.)   She warned there would be \\\"fire in the sky\\\" as a warning that the   second world war was about to start.  About a week before Germany  invaded, weathermen (and women, I suppose) all over Europe, from  England to Spain to Eastern Europe, reported the most spectacular  reddish color in the sky ever recorded.  To this day some try to   explain it off as the northern lights, and the relation to Mary's  prediction simply coincidence.  You all can decide for yourselves.   Mary predicted that the Atheistic Russia would spread her evils all  over the world and persecute religion.     She said many other things as well, too numerous to list here.  Every  single one has been realized.   One can only use the term \\\"coincidence\\\"  so many times in the same explanation before its use becomes   ridiculous.     SO...yes, there are many false prophets and many false reports. There  are true ones, too.  We must always remain open to that.  Fatima was  one example.

NASA  officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th  launch date.      The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB  technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster,  its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a  part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.

Hentrich        baba@Tymnet.Com -    I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich calling himself an Aryan.  The word `Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first in the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda.  It seems to have been a tribal term but may have had connotations of good character.  Such connotations are quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the eightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholar Max Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the Nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is synonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  The people who originally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans and possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the word by Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is nontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claim to call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor- shipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.    If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory's book, ``In search of the Indo-Europeans\\\" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica. The reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and for Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible things done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans have no clear claim.\",\"  Their testimony would be a contradiction of the plaintiff's charge (and witness) that the occupant moved after the impact, indicating he was alive and trying to get out (and provoking all sorts of sympathetic 'gross, burned alive' reactions).

I think on balance, intervention would create more victims, including American ones.  Since the first responsibility of the US government is to protect Americans, I think they serve that role best by staying away from Bosnia and other regional conflicts.   Of course not.  The Jews were not trying to carve a territory out of Germany either, and except for small-scale resistance and a few larger uprisings, did not have an army or a government.   I see the pattern of atrocities as a fairly often practiced tactic of a colonizing power - driving away and/or eliminating the population of an area they want to control.  The US tried basically that in Vietnam, the Iraqis in Kuwait, the Israelis in Palestine, South Africa, etc, etc, etc.  It sucks, it's ugly, and it's saddening.  But it is not genocide.  It is not my impression that the Serbs want to eliminate every Muslim in Yugoslavia.  I still say the Bosnians are getting their asses kicked; they should surrender and evacuate the areas they can't hold.   I am a staunch Republican, BTW.  The irony of arguing against military intervention with arguments based on Vietnam has not escaped me.  I was opposed to US intervention in Somalia for the same reasons, although clearly it was not nearly as risky.   Well, one thing you have to remember is, the press likes a good story.

Thanks -jh\",\" I am not so sure of Jewish proselytism then, but I would like to relate an account of a recent dinner I had with Jews a few months ago.  The dinner was instigated by the aunt of the hostess, whom I had met while visiting my wife in Galveston last October.  The dear old aunt (now  deceased) was very proud of her Jewish heritage, although not especially devout.  Her parents were both murdered in Nazi concentration camps in Austria during WWII because they were Jewish.  While conversing with her about politics, world affairs and religion, she remarked that it would  be a good idea for me to visit her niece on my return to Atlanta.  Within two days of returning to Atlanta, her niece called to invite me over for dinner with her husband.  I went, not knowing really what to expect, other than stimulating conversation and fellowship.  What I got, however, was rather unexpected.  The thrust of the evening's discussion was to condemn the Reagan-Bush policies prohibiting abortion counseling  in federally funded family planning clinics, prohibiting the sterilization of minorities on welfare here and in Puerto Rico, on the ban on fetal tissue research, and against the Mexico City policy, \\\"which denies U.S. foreign aid to programs overseas that promote abortion.\\\"  The crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of \\\"overpopulation,\\\" rampant domestic crime, African starvation, unwed mothers, etc., on Christianity, rather on the fall of Adam.  Now, this is not what I had to come to talk about.  But every time I tried to  bring up the subject of Judaism, they would condemn Jews for Jesus and admonish me against converting to Judaism, \\\"because it involves too much study and effort.\\\"  And I did not even raise the prospect, nor try to convert them to the truth of Christ!  There was certainly no Jewish proselytism going on there.  And again, last November I toured a \\\"traditional\\\" Jewish synagogue and was subjected to a 30-minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity in general.  I realize that these are two isolated incidents, and that the best supervisor I ever had at work is Jewish, but from my experience, the modern Jew is not known for his proselytism.    --  boundary\",\"I love the FAQ.

If this is completly attributable to the intentional slight undercorrection, then it can be compensated for when necessary with glasses (or contacts, if they CAN be worn afterall!).

Have you read Jesus' word in Matt5:14-19? Is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is sin (Greek hamartia = missing the mark)?

How do you unite this concept of yours with the Ten Commandments and Jesus's word in Matt5:14-19?   Or, they assumed that the Ten Commandments and Jesus' word in Matt5:14-19 actually stood for something? Perhaps they were \\\"strong in the faith?\\\"  ---------------------------  [No, I don't believe that Paul can overrule God.  However Paul was writing for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5. As far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did continue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they continued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with Gentile Christians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it).  Jesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that Mat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact with Gentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a couple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke 7) suggest that he was a \\\"God-fearer\\\", i.e. a Gentile who followed God, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended by Jewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such. This seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view that Gentiles need not accept the Law.  However there's more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on the Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ. Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law. It still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.  While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law.  The \\\"not an iota or dot\\\" would suggest a rather literal reading, but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the \\\"ceremonial law\\\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards.  The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish ceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much trouble.  It's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the way terms like \\\"family values\\\" take on special meaning from the current context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why \\\"family values\\\" should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I think Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was involved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values that go along with the term \\\"Law\\\", any more than people who concerned about the \\\"family values\\\" movement are really opposed to family values.\",\"Time once again to clean out the ol' closet.

I have a IIsi that came with a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.   First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum quarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them was stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a problem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for over two months.  The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal hard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard connector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare cable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found in any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of shorts or bad connections.  Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk ribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another male connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again, and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not damaged, and I can go back to the original setup.  Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this day.   In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of the drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are intact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal should be terminated at all the ends.

Of coures, having only original sins on thier souls, they suffer the lightest punishment, the loss of the vision oand presence of God, but that does not change the undeniable fact that they cannot possibly come to a forgivenss of original sin, nor can they inherit eternal life.  \\\"That,\\\" as St. Augustine said, \\\"Is what the Pelagian heretics taught.\\\"  Which is why he said later, \\\"If you want to be a Christian, do not teach that unbaptized infants can come to a forgivenss of original sin.\\\"]\",\"I appreciated the follow-ups and replies to my earlier query.  One reply, which I have lost, suggested several parishes in New York that have good Masses, one  of which was Corpus Christi in downtown Manhattan.  By coincidence, last week's _America_, the national Jesuit magazine, carried an interview with Fr. Myles  Bourke, Corpus Christi's pastor emeritus.  Fr. Bourke also directed the NT  translation in the New American Bible.  He noted \\\"...certain practices have  been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality,  and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy.\\\"  I note that at my  parents' parish on Easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the  offertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word \\\"risen\\\".  This was not a  kiddie mass, either, but the well-attended 11:00 Mass.  I wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies.  This newsgroup as a whole offers generally moderate (perhaps because it's moderated) conversation on topics that often lead people to extreme behavior (including myself). Sometimes people do go over the top, but the remarkable thing is how that is the exception, I think.  Benefits of the doubt are generally granted.  It seems so...Christian?\",\"I was a graduate student in the early 1980s, and we had a conference on  Reaganomics where Jerry Jordan, then a member of the Council of Economic  Advisors, was a speaker.  I had the pleasure of driving him back to the  airport afterwards, and since taxes were the main topic of discussion I  thought I would ask him about the VAT.  I have favored it for these reasons  you mention, that the income base is too hazy to define, that it taxes  savings and investment, that it is likely to be more visible.  He agreed,  and reported that the CEA at that time was in favor of VAT.  So why not  propose it?  I asked.  He replied that the Reagan White House feared that  the Democrats would introduce VAT *in addition to* the income tax, rather  than in lieu.  Better not to give them any ideas, he said.  Pretty prescient.  Yes, any Canadian readers, please tell us if the tax is displayed on price  stickers (I'm relatively certain it is not in Europe).\",\"    J.N. Darby was one of the founders of the \\\"Plymouth Brethren\\\" and an early supporter of dispensationalism.  F.F. Bruce highly approved of his translation.  He also translated the Bible into several other languages.   This was from the same fellow who did Young's Concordance, which was a standard reference work, similar to Strong's concordance.

During the season, he was probably more valuable than, say, putting Olerud out there to pitch, but yeah, he *was* valuable in getting them there. In the postseason, he sucked dirty canal water through a straw. The Jays won *in spite* of Morris much more than *because of* him.   Umm, Roger? Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago, where the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measure of better. The concept is called \\\"context\\\", and you should really become familiar with it someday.   Unless this transaltes to \\\"Clemens hasn't gone into Lou Gorman's office with a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he'd been traded to the Jays,\\\" I'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.   What on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has \\\"won\\\" 68% of the games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17 wins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If so, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris allows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in his career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. But I forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance to Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it would have been a routine groundout, right?   Speaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have spent a few too many games in goal without a mask.   No one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win at least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the World Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they keep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they traded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link between Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs out, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992, gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.  Seriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference between the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher, and why? Did Morris somehow \\\"learn how to win\\\" in the intervening ten years? If so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half a run lower than 1992?

When Lemieux or Gilmour play their number one purpose is to score- defence is secondary- especially considering the line that plays against them is probably a defensive one.

I had mentioned before that there is a report commissioned by the UN to study the Litani river, it is  still in draft form.  The Israeli gov't also commissioned a study on the river that was done by Dr. Ben Wolfe. The Litani starts in the Bekaa valley in Lebanon, flows Southward, then West across South Lebanon and discharges into the Mediterranean near the city of Tyre. There are other rivers such as the Hasbani and the Wazzani that start in Lebanese territory than join the Jordan river.   The most mentioned plan was one that would divert water from the Litani into these, then the water would flow naturally into the Lac De Houle.  BUT there is no evidence of any diversion structure (which would need to be at least 3 km long).  The area is mountainous, inaccessible and occupied by Israel so I have not seen any independent  reports of the existence of any diversion structure there. Another often mentioned diversion is through deep wells. It is also rumored that Israe has 600 m wells tapping into deep aquifers and drawing water on the Israeli side of the border.  If such wells are indeed under use they would be costly to operate  (high energy costs) and the Lebanese and Israeli gov't should  agree on the distribution of water from shared aquifers as part of an overall peace plan and the bilateral negociations on \\\"regional issues\\\".  The fact that we have been at war all this time has led to the current state of affairs where withdrawals from such aquifers is completely unregulated.   Basil    \",\" You are nto alone.

Someone had to protect them. If not us who??

There are some things on which there can not be a compromise.    Any person who supports the policies of the Turkish goverment directly or indirecly is a \\\"bad\\\" person. It is not your nationality that makes you bad, it is your support of the actions of your goverment that make you \\\"bad\\\". People do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you are. You are a supporter of the policies of the Turkish goverment and as a such you must pay the price.   You do not need brainwashing to turn people against the Turks. Just talk to Greeks, Arabs, Slavs, Kurds and all other people who had the luck to be under Turkish occupation.

I sin.  I can resolve to abstain from  sin, and do weekly (more often, actually).  Yet I routinely fail. I surely do deserve what I get, yet God compassionately provided  the Incarnate Logos, Jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation. If AIDS is deserved, I surely deserve instant death just as much, as do we all, as St. Paul so cogently remids us.  To willingly judge \\\"others\\\" as deserving punishment seems to me to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.      So what's the point here?  I can get AIDS and NEVER engage in \\\"deviant\\\" sexual behavior.  In fact, I could engage in LOTS of deviant sexual behavior with HIV+ people and never be infected.  AIDS is a consequence of particular behaviors, many of which are not sexual.  And not all sexual behaviors carry the risk of transmission.      The end of all things is to know, love and serve God, growing daily closer through prayer, meditation and discipline.  Even so I could get AIDS.  Anyone could, unless they remain forever celibate, IV-drug-free, and transfusion free.

Space Science Dept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail proposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting. Here goes :      The Microlight Solar Sail    -------------------------  1. Introduction The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.  However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.  2.Design Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control methods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.  The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.  3.Missions The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example: a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit rate. b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base, BTW] c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged tube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an ideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300 deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating container.

When the Pirates play, the games will be carried by  WDVE(102.5 fm).  WDVE will carry 12 games, starting with tonight's game.  In fact, after this season, KDKA will no longer be the flagship station for the Pens.  The Penguins and KBL have struck a new  deal regarding the TV and radio rights to the games.  It seems more than likely that WDVE will be the flagship radio station next  season.  KBL will carry 62 games on tv,  with 17 of the games to be  simulcast on KDKA-TV.  The remaining 22 games, as well as some of the  early round playoff games, will be available by \\\"subscription tv\\\" only. To receive the games, you'll have to pay a one time hook up fee, and then a monthly fee of $11-12 dollars.  Also, under the new deal, there will no longer be radio/tv  simulcasts.  There will be a TV broadcast team, and a radio broadcast team.    No word on who the announcers will be.

It is because of (1) attitude  and (2) cooperation. In the 'good' neighborhoods, the residents  make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when  strangers are lurking around. 'Good' neighborhoods form groups  like 'crime-watch' to increase this effect, and the relative  effectiveness of the police. When hostiles are arrested, the  good neighbors step up and say \\\"THAT'S the one officer ! He  was robbing Mr. Jones' house\\\".

PDT                  Q   I had two questions for both Presidents, so you  could probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)              THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll  give you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)              Q   The first is that this is the meeting of the  Presidents, so the money that's being promised is government  money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the  government.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going  to be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian  businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What  are the priorities, because there are several association of  Russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to  participate in setting up priorities for investment?                This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know  that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans  are very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls  say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times  published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war;  42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent  if it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to  sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not  very enthusiastic?  Thank you.              Q   I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going  to be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the  answers.  Just the answers.  Okay.              THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is,  it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example,  the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will  obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be  good risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will  be used to support the privatization of existing public  enterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the  Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have  some influence over the distribution of.                With regard to your second question, let me say that  I would think that there would be people in both countries who  would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government  giving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to  that in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history  there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That  is, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole  history of America, any kind of aid program has always been  unpopular.                What I have tried to tell the American people is, is  this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that  this is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion -- trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments  because of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in  Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them  working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies  going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it  possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the  economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and  investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce  nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on  our side and on the Russian side.                So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an  investment for the United States.  This is very much in the  interest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the  second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next  week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for  the taxpayers and workers of my country.                Russia is a very great nation that needs some  partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share  her goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view  this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not  what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful  investment.                Like all investments, there is some risk.  But  there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than  the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier  of the Cold War.              Q   Mr. President, first of all thank you very  much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory  of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American  President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind  of a very measured breakthrough.                I have two questions.  One, in your introductory  remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief  that you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you  tell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to  what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification  of START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how  confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager  to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions  inherited from the Cold War?                PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of  Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with  regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent  states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States  develop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing  that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of  the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude  our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that  would provide not only an important economic opportunity for  Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out  on our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed  off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and  we agreed to continue to press that.              I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to  reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the  Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the  United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine,  but that, in order to do what we need to do together to  strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States  be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join  the NPT regime is critical.              What was the second question?                THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and  COCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the  Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will,  as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other  restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on  relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies  of the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of  them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the  leadership of the Congress.              With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be  an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there  are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to  emigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there  is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed  to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be  much less.              With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing  more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my  own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement  out of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to  begin it in the fairly near future.              Q   Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in  Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely  different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not  political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of  Mr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the  difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the  difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of  Mr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the  last part of your speech?              THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to  compare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say  what was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a  boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the  music and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been  thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music  for more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists  and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know  as much as I could about your history.                And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then  the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last  presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone  in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr.  Yeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I  was following events there very closely and hoping for the day  when we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a  personal feeling about Russia.                I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like  music very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a  musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York  Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony  to the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly  than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically  so difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it  occurred.                These are things that have always had a big impact  on my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever  had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two  countries become closer partners.  (Applause.)

Nazi Armenians were of service  to Germans in Arab countries as well. As Uzun put it, one well-known  case which received a lot of media-coverage involved two Nazi Armenian  agents which were dropped over Syria by Italian war planes. The mission  of the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and  to acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied  forces in the area.[1] Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda  efforts in Arab countries designed to promote pro-Nazi sentiments among  the French- and British-ruled Arab populations. Beirut had traditionally been strong-hold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was the center of international Armenian terrorism.   In Russia General Dro (the Butcher), the architect of the Turkish genocide in WWI, was working closely with the German Secret  Service. He entered the war zone with his own men and acquired important intelligence about the Soviets. His experience with the Turkish genocide in x-Soviet Armenia made him an invaluable  source for the Germans.[2]  [1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., p. 150.

Thanks.\",\" Even if what Brad says turns out to be accurate, you can bet that the Administration will have made it \\\"very clear\\\" to the vendors that \\\"it would very much be in their best interests\\\" to institute a \\\"voluntary\\\" policy of refusing to sell anything but Clinton Cripple equipped equipment to anyone other than \\\"Authorized government agencies and Law Enforcement\\\", or individuals and corporations who \\\"have been been determined by the Administration to have a valid need on a case-by-case basis\\\" for an effective system.  Note that this is very much like the language used in many gun control bills/laws the Administration is pushing for, or otherwise supporting. The logic and actual rationale (as opposed to the excuses that get fed to the media) is the same in both cases, only the items or technology in question are different.  I think this is no accident.  It comes from the same philosophy that the government rules/controls the people, not the people controlling the government, that the unconnected citizens are not sophisticated enough to know what is best for them, so the government must tell the people what they need or do not need ... \\\"we know best...\\\".  And the idea that that a commoner can defend himself against government eavesdropping or unlawful attack is totally unacceptable to people with this outlook.   Combine this all with pushing for national identity cards with 'smart chips' to encode anything they please (internal passport) under the guise of streamlining the State People's Health Care System, and with (you can be certain) more jewels yet to come, and one sees an extremely ominous trend.  So what if \\\"1984\\\" will be ten years late... it still is turning out to be an amazingly accurate prophecy... unless a LOT of people wake up, and in a hurry.  One should ALWAYS have every red warning light and bell and danger flag come up when the government seeks to set itself apart in regard to rights, etc.  from the unconnected/unprivileged citizen (or should we now be saying 'subject' instead?)...  Why SHOULDN'T the average person have a good, secure system of data security, not dependent on nebulous 'safeguards' for maintaining that security?  Why SHOULDN'T the average person be able to defend himself from an agency gone rogue?  0I am sure the Feds could break into any data they really wanted to (but it would take some WORK), and using the same logic, one should not be allowed to have a good safe, unless a duplicate of the key(s) or combination are submitted for 'safekeeping' by the government?  I don't really see a difference, philosophically.

I agree that we'll probably never agree, and I'm starting to feel  frustrated, and I'm tired of having my conversations with my husband  dominated by this topic (just kidding, :-)).  I do have to say, though, that participating in this discussion has been a good learning experience for me.  My views on this topic have evolved and clarified through this, and I suspect that we may not disagree as  much as we think.   I admit that I'm strongly prejudiced against evangelical Christianity, and I may not always be rational in my reactions to it.  I grew up in EC, and went to an EC college.  It was definitely the wrong place for me, and I react strongly to any implication that EC or conservative Christianity has any sort of stronghold on true Christianity.  I shudder  when I remember the condescending attitude I had about other Christians  who didn't adhere to the EC model.  I have come to see that my real objection to this whole notion of  absolute truth is the actions I have seen it lead to.  I have had some  very bad experiences with evangelical Christians claiming to know the  truth, and judging me or others based on their belief that they have  the answers.  Knowing the truth doesn't seem to leave a whole lot of  room for others' opinions.  I can accept your belief in absolute truth as long as you* don't try to  use that belief to try to force others to comply with it, and you are  very careful that you don't hurt others with it.  Love your neighbor  seems to go totally out the window when one knows the truth and believes  that everyone should be living by that truth.  Other people have  convictions about the truth every bit as strong and sincere as yours,  based on careful searching, prayer, and their relationship with God.   Don't dismiss them because God didn't lead them to the same conclusions  as yours.  *This is not directed personally at you, Dean.\",\"    Good point.  The New Testament does not quote Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Ruth, Job, Ecclesiastes, or Song of Songs, just as it does not quote from the Deuterocanon.  But if the non-quotation of the former does not disqualify them, neither does the non-quotation of the later.  And the Wisodm of Solomon was quite clearly an influence on St. Paul, especially in the letter to the Romans (cf especially Romans 1.18-32 and Wisdom 13-14).  [stuff deleted]    True.  Not all accepted them as Scripture, though niether were all the books of the New Testament so accepted, which puts to the lie the whole argument of the books being excluded because they were debated and not universally accepted.  Hebrews, the Apocalypse, 2 Peter, Esther, and others were debated at various times, but eventually retained.  As for the Codexes you mention, both Vaticanus and Sinaitcus include the Deuterocanon, bothe of the New and Old Testaments, and Vaticanus (I think) inlcudes 1 Clement, the Shepard of Hermas, and the Epistle of Baranabas.  As for the Muratorian Canon, it deals with the New Testament only, though it is very valuable in its witness to those books.     You're not wrong!  It is a `tradition of men' to exlcude them, as I will explain below.  \\\"That nothing be read in the Church under the nmae of Divine Scripture, except the canonical Scriptures, and the canoncial Scriptures are - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Four books of Kingdoms [being 1&2 Samuel and 1&2 Kings], Two books of Paralpomenon [being 1&2 Chronicles], Job, the Psalter of David, the Five books of Solomon [being Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of Solomon, and [misatributed to him] the Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach], The books of the Twelve (Minor) Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah [being Jeremiah, the Lamentations, Baruch, and the Letter, all of which were formerly counted as one], Ezekiel, Daniel, Tobit, Judith, Esther, Two books of Ezra [being Ezra and Nehemiah], Two books of Maccabees.

Shalom, Robert Switzer ka2czu@cbnewsh.att.com\",\" [ description of experiment deleted ]   [ more deleted ]   A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands.  To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.  Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print. Who'd have guessed?\",\"About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published  solutions to it.   The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the  edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw  the object we   1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively  computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the         curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume  that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not  exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable  measure. 2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment  of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two  triangles which will be filled in to color the surface. 3) Depth sort the triangles 4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw  and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is  along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge  colored with a special \\\"edge color\\\"   It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface. The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated. They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area.\",\"Can I resign BMW MOA and get the remainder of my 5-year membership refunded?  \",\"%I say buy out Henderson's contract and let him go bag groceries.

I have thought about the implications, and it is scary.    We have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have  decided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for the thrill of a younger, more attractive woman.  If we accept that it is legitimate for Jane to have divorced, how can we not accept anyone's decision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he can have a more \\\"deep, committed relationship.\\\"  Marriage is not a state of being, it is a mutual journey in life. Love is not a passive feeling, it must be actively willed.  Is it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many  years who stayed home to care for the children because he can't be happy sexually unless he is with a beautiful young blonde?  The real solution for both in the couple to make a renewed effort.    Hold fast to the faith.  Has not the Lord repeatedly compared His relation to His people as a faithful and enduring husband?  We learn something very deep and very mystical when we marry and remain faithful through times of trial.  My spouse has a brain tumor that has left her partially paralyzed.

That's life...the Lord would certainly not give me permission to seek someone else to satisfy my \\\"needs.\\\"    The idea that it is alright to divorce if a couple \\\"grows apart\\\" seems to me to lead to such a monstrous destruction of the meaning of marriage that I feel we must make every effort to avoid any hint of compromise.

Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50.  I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?  Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost?  I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI HD's SCSI-2?  Thanks for any comments on these rephrased questions.\",\"...  I seriously doubt that any practical implementation of this proposal would place the onus on the individual to register keys.  Realistically, the Clipper-Chip will probably emit an ID code which will serve as the identifier when requesting the key fragments.  The chip manufacturer would register this identifier code vs. key combination when the chip is made and the (uninitiated) end-user can therefore remain completely outside the loop. The chip could be used in a cellular phone, a modem, or other device -- it really makes no difference:  When the authorities detect the use of this encryption standard during surveillance, they would then capture the ID and apply for the key in order to decrypt the data.\",\"Sounds like the picture tube lost vacuum.

A columnist for the St.  Paul \\\"Pioneer Press\\\" wrote an article giving the \\\"inside scoop\\\" on the  issue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible  candiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic  Center (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty  confident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will  ultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other  two sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the  inter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name)  believes that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also,  because of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed  until (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.   However, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed,  because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for  conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to  this mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future  viability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even  further.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of  knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging  Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met,  which may happen.  Regarding possible candidates, the three teams are  Hartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \\\" Ice Demons?\\\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't  been announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the  Target Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in  as many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see  Hartford and Tampa show up there either. So, Minnesota may end up  getting another team, but it may take a few years.     Go Sabres!\",\"     Well it looks as if Digi-Key sells a chip with the number ICL232 that does what you want.

AA and other 12-step abuse- recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.  Unfortunately, as evidence for God, this can be dismissed by stating that the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes  people 'religious', and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that being religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict, but still maintain that both are escapism.  (And I suspect that there are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to Christianity.)  I think that an essential problem with communication between Christ- ians and atheists is that as Christians we necessarily see ourselves as incomplete, and needing God (the 'God-shaped hole'), while atheists necessarily see themselves as self-sufficient.  If the atheists are right, Christians are guilty of being morally weak, and too cowardly to stand up for themselves; if the Christians are right, the atheists are guilty of considerable arrogance.

Cheers, Kent\",\"        Horrors, appealing to popular principles.  Can we perhaps as the question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal to the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written with something else in mind and \\\"propoganda\\\" put out by its supporters.         But let's be honest about something, here.  When was the last time you brought up all the valid points against your own arguments?         Or are they simply propogranda?  We can't know what Phill *really* means because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince.          If they're true or false, regardles of why they were said, why on earth did you make a point of calling them \\\"propogranda?\\\"  That would seem to be irrelevent.          Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don't believe they no longer apply, but that's because I think most of them were good arguments.  I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.          Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political system, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this particular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure and tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)           In principle no?  That they had less power of that they should have had less power?           Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  While the Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although badly) to the U.S. President.          Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives is \\\"in principle\\\" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate) but in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the Constitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh darn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put those extra restrictions on the Senate in?         Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell you, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of government to \\\"attack\\\" which presents them with the best chance of getting what they want.  With national \\\"interest groups\\\" it is simply a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a law rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less  \\\"contributions\\\" to make.          Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at the Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little state battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance, medicine, and most other questions.        Local government has not \\\"failed\\\" in that it hasn't done what it should, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their rules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout, only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because it can impose its will on the lower.        I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus- and such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed to a local crime?        The more people want the more Congress will take power to \\\"sell\\\" it to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of \\\"special interests\\\" is coincidence with the increased power of Congress.          Bingo.  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual need matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher levels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to in effectiveness.          Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York?  I remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable of educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And if you leave it to them, you only have to worry about the \\\"pork\\\" in that state.  And since industries can't concentrate their political power and wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get what they want, individual voices have more relative impact.         The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must \\\"buy off\\\" states, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.          But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself  that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact national legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem is significantly reduced.          The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable to action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering the government the usually the institution with the sole power to enforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those decisions a good thing.          The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have more legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution than the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is harder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing new deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out without a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the entire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different areas, different solutions may be called for.         And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local and state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to the city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather the majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in Washington with half a million or more constituents.         I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels are more corrupt.            Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators should be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was suppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this. Which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders wanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them, I never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution, which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for the House.          The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration of Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other examples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the reasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)          To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something it wasn't intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering the Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they want them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying about the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which almost necessitates its abuse.          *BUSH?*  Phill, that's absurd.  Bush had *37* vetos, one of which was over-ridden.  Go read up on FDR if you think that's anything resembling a record.          Why not?  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system against action?  Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have not been successful.  When you're in a position of imposing federal power on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to got through something more than a bare majority          Now we're switching from a general question of a fillibuster to a specific bill.  I don't see how it make a difference.          Sure it's arguable.  Theyr'e *arguing* it.  However, requiring 60% to bring it to a vote ensures that they'll have to have a *good* argument.  Something that isn't based solely on party lines.          No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority for *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough about.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don't advocate the minority being capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing the *federal* system against action. \",\"   That's OK -- you can mail me if you want more discussion.    Around here, long-guns are proof of age and fill out the forms. For pistols, nation-wide check for felonies and three days wait.  The \\\"good reason\\\" is the difference, and one Americans tend to get annoyed over as we see no reason the guy with the badge is any better than us.    Not when dealing with America.  I can drive an 18-wheel truck with no permit, no license, and at age 12 if I'm engaged in farming work.  Strange, that, but there is little to no problem with this. Again, personal rights versus collective security.    Strange that the rates would decline, since killing somebody is much more frowned upon than merely stealing a gun.    Why attract attention?  I carry my sword openly to and from practice, as that is the only legal thing I can do.  I also attract a lot of attention doing this.  I'd rather be lost \\\"in a crowd of one\\\" than be the subject of attention while carrying a weapon.  Think of the word \\\"intimidation\\\" and you can see where intimidation is not the preferable method for the normal citizen.    Aggressive towards whom?  Southerners?  Germans?  Precisely why I think your society is less violent, weapons aside.    Then the masses have the same rights as the individuals, because everything comes down to the individual in one instance or another.  To draw an analogy, Norway is involved in the EEC.  The USA in involved in NATO.  The EEC requires certain changes in your laws.  NATO requires no such changes in USA law.  These laws affect citizens, and hence Norway is saying Europe is more important than, say, Norwegians having motorcycles that make over 100bhp.  In the USA, we'd likely tell the EEC to get stuffed since the EEC has no business, in our eyes, in telling us how much horsepower we can safely ride.  While I note that our own state governments often play with game with the federal government, in essence this is a cultural difference between us.    It shouldn't.  Since neither of our countries has managed to remove criminals from society, in America we feel (and remember we have individual states that are larger than your country) that if the police cannot protect us then we must do so ourselves.  The criminals in our country are quite violent, hence we prepare for them.    We don't.  E-mail me to find out just how difficult it really is in this country.  It is easier than in yours, but theft is far easier than the troubles we go through to purchase over here.    They are neither.  They are an option.

I think the support droid was malfunctioning and confused the disk space limit with the virtual address space limit.  As far as the disk is concerned, you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space. The limit that causes the message, \\\"Windows will only use ...,\\\" is the amount of virtual address space that the Virtual Memory Manager will create, and this is a function of the amount of free memory that you have when Windows starts.  In the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI, you can specify a parameter:   PageOverCommit=multiplier  The following description is from the Windows Resource Kit:   This entry specifies the multiplier what determines the amount of  linear address space the VMM will create for the system, which is  computed by rounding up the amount of available physical memory to  the nearest 4 MB and then multiplying that value by the value  specified for PageOverCommit=.  Increasing this value increases the  amount of available linear address space, causing the size of data  structures to increase.  This also increases paging activity  proportionately and can slow down the system.  You can specify a  value between 1 and 20.  The default is 4.  To change this entry,  you must edit SYSTEM.INI. \",\" Right on, it is every citizen's right and duty to FORCE government accountability.

This has been true from the foundation of the world.  Pagan practices are then either:  1. foreshadowings of the True Celebration of the Resurrection,     in which dim light was shone forth so that people would    recognize the full truth when it was manifested, OR  2. satanic counterfeits intended to deceive us so that we would not    recognize the truth when it was manifested.  I don't believe the second argument, because I believe in the power of the Resurrection, the fulfillment of the Incarnation, and our hope. Earlier or parallel ideas in other religions clearly are dim images of the truth of the Resurrection.  As Paul states, we see through a glass darkly.  So do others.  It serves no purpose arguing about who has the darker or lighter glass.  The foreshadowings are not perfect. So what? Our understnding of God is today imperfect, for we are not yet perfected.  Theosis is not a gift such that WHAM, we're perfect.

Ang then, the cop gives chase.  Now this was an interesting episode because it was all videotaped!!! Everything from the dramatic takeoff and 135mph chase to the sidestreet battle at about 100mph.  What happened at the end?  The guy (who is being relentless chased down box the cage with the disco lights) slows a couple of times to taunt the cop.

No fun, but I must have met the minority then. And \\\"given by god\\\" refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something.     Rob, I am not intimate with Jewish theology, but I understand that you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god views, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute evil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.     (Deletion)   The context was metaphysics, even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent, the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion. I wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system.     (Deletion)   Is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds. The context is repulsive, and it is foul play, IMO, to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book.     (Big deletion)   No, not the interpretation of some laws, but the interpretation of the bible. As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue with god. The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo- logic question) is proof of a theology used.       It is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection between the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of it, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better. You might answer that one can't becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but that holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place? Can't it be replaced somehow? Is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other message that is included as well?     (Deletion)   Sorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system.   (Deletion)   If we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?     And the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it can be crucial in other questions.

Recursiveness has no problems, it is just horribly inefficient (just ask any assembly programmer.)   The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights, is a complete lie and deception, as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving.  Liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost,  almost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable? Similarly for right of life.  When one person must die if he is to save another, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable?   That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty,  especially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable, the serial killer, or the victim?  According to that beautiful line, those two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should be able to remove them.  This _includes_ government.  Admittedly the serial killer has restricted some people's life and/or liberty, but is not his own life/liberty inviolate also?  According to the declaration of independence, it is.   Oooh, I like that.  It means that killing an infant is not murder because it cannot be against its will.  Reason, an infant has no will as such.  Similarly for people who are brain dead (easier to see), in a coma, etc.  Also, under current law, accidental killing is still murder.  How will you include that?   The only real golden rule in life is, he who has the gold, makes the rules.  I.e. Might Makes Right.  That is survival.  Now what is wrong with that?   If you mean the golden rule as I stated, yes, almost every system as implemented has used that in reality.  Sorry, I don't deal as much in fiction, as I do in reality.

Date: Sat Apr 17 07:13:05 1993  A friend of mine got a Mag of the above model and it had some distrotion, so he sent it back.  Unfortunately, the replacement also was distorted.  I would bet it's a common problem.

Gregg is not, as I understand his posts, giving any support to the bounty on Rushdie's life.  If that's correct, end of one point...  Gregg is using the concept of legal in a way most Westerners don't accept. His comments about Islamic Law I think make a great deal of sense to him, and are even making a _little_ sense to me now - if a person is a member of a group (religion or whatever) they bind themselves to follow the ways of the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum. The big bone of contention here that I'm picking up is that in the West we have secular governments that maintain, more or less, a level of control and of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups.  I think the majority of us reading this thread are in tune (note - I didn't say \\\"in agreement\\\") with the idea that you are finally responsible to the secular government,  and within that to the group or groups a person may have chosen.  With that in mind, it not possible under secular law (\\\"legally\\\" as most people would define the term) to hold a person to a particular group once they decide to separate from it.  Only if the secular authorities agree that there is a requirement of some sort (contractual, etc) is there any secular _enforcement_ allowed by a group to a group member or past group member.  A religion can, and often does, believe in and require additional duties of a group member.  And it can enforce the fulfillment of those duties in many ways - ostracism is common for example.  But the limit comes when the enforcement would impose unwanted and/or unaccepted onus on a person _in conflict with secular law_.  This is the difference.  In a theocracy, the requirements of the secular authorities are, by definition, congruent with the religious authorities. Outside a theocracy, this is not _necessarily_ true.  Religious requirements _may_ coincide or may not.  Similiarly, religious consequences _may_ or may not coincide with secular consequences (if any).  Regards,  Dew\",\"Bzzzt.

You may as well know that all this stuff about the secret source of the Clipper announcement is because of a silly mistake.  I am the administrator of csrc.ncsl.nist.gov, alias first.org.  It's a system set up to help out the needs of FIRST, a Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, which  includes a number of world-wide incident response teams such as CERT/CC and other places in Europe.  As to the VRFY and EXPN commands, they are normally disabled, since early on we didn't want crackers to find out the names of incident response folks on our mailing lists.  We had a disk crash several months ago which required completely rebuilding the O/S files - same old story, our backups weren't especially helpful.  As you can guess, I didn't remember to re-disable VRFY and EXPN until I saw people on the net trying to find out who was behind clipper@csrc...  When I saw people's names posted here, I felt it was time to clear things up.  So, EXPN and VRFY on csrc have always been disabled in the past for reasons having nothing to do with  Clipper.  I posted the White House announcements at the request of policy folks here because csrc also provides Usenet service.  I posted them from an account called 'clipper.'  I also created an alias called 'clipper' that contains the addresses of members of the NIST Computer Security Privacy and Advisory Board, set up under law of the Computer Security Act of 1987, and addresses of other individuals not affiliated with NIST but involved in cryptography, security, and privacy - I believe that these individuals were included on this list because NIST felt it important to get them the Clipper information first-hand.  The 'clipper' alias is there for the benefit of those named above.  It is  not a source for information, it was set up solely to monitor any initial traffic.  Individuals on the list have requested that they continue to get traffic that is not already duplicated on Usenet.  While you can rightfully say we were a bit disorganized in handling this, I would ask that people stop speculating about any hidden agendas or motives of the individuals on the 'clipper' alias - I've already apologized to them for what's happened.  Disabling EXPN and VRFY is an increasingly common practice (albeit unfriendly to some), and any effect of disabling it again was unintentional.\",\"GRE software for MS-DOS, from StudyWare. original disk, manual.

This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary,  ether sucking structures, AND why we observe \\\"orbital\\\" motion!!    Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic  waves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the  Michelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago.     I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact  that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the  earth's surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption  that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)    The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the  development of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications  of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!    REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!     1   I dream like this: ether based reality     The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations  start as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices both drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it,  converting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy.  (non-spinning lattice = \\\"dark matter\\\")    The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image  of a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us  being stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by  the spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is  spinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner  kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a  faster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground  of the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but  its \\\"foot print\\\" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])      The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self  spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is  itself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the  wobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The \\\"orbit\\\" of the earth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged around by the sun's ether feild.    The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and \\\"distance\\\"  apart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because  the \\\"path\\\" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like  sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half  turn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has  got the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to  the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a \\\"j\\\" hook at  the end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the  whole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there.     With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon  can be about as big as \\\"earth's\\\" shadow upon it, and at other times  totally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge,  would you guess that they are about the same size, just because they  look about the same size?     O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S  E       /     \\\\                 M    |      |      OR                M              \\\\ _ _ /                                 S                                      The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate of ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating \\\"turntable view\\\"  of the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a  half moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the  day. Try and draw that \\\"earth shadow.\\\") Its only the moon's image  which appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is  the part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away  from the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.    \\\"Light-Years\\\" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is  closer to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase  of reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion.  (defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be  essentially happening now. The \\\"piece\\\" of light may have experienced  many years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.    To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to  de-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design  a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like  trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)    To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd  look in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just  might carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the  spectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+  billion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG  backwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card  for Pentium!)    Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound  media, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I  would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which  I'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole.  [Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a  two foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I  could get with my machine's receiver next to it.      If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT  PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of  life's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our  thoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By  eating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant  instructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or  biblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what  they did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we  don't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and  that is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where  did the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it  is programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then  die)    Warning about writing to the past: I had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel  future, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from.  There were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an  Oscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us,  and then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the  others into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by  \\\"advising\\\" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into  reproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that  the little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to  provide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it  in his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his  control. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying  that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve  souls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was  finite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in  our reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it  seemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then  some of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no  more, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped  through his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that  he had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body,  existing only on the wind.     MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls  whose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat  others as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a  lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for  playmates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back)    Accepting rides to the past: Once here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a  Prince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go  ahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry.  I Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes  your work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross  paths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own  course of history, none the wiser.    As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped  back in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still  make changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with  every 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which  loosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less.  But he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had  to apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand  to retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers.     How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country,  our money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this:  Washington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to  congress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks  are making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big  corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the  banks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but  mostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14  hours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time  to buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If  we are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if  the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets?     In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, \\\"its chaos!\\\" They  said, \\\"no, its order.\\\" He defined chaos as that which is he was not  able to control.    Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy  would hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no  language. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death) (think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and  pointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably  naive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should  be able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about.  They can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers  might have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a  different frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.    Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a  huge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat  only fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and  need a lot less sleep.    UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The  troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill  each other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)    Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot  tall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they  suck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that  they aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life.     Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women  and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut  from the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think  that there may be some very interesting results to this, such as  mother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples  of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.    That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He  tells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which  the people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll  play a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll  whine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to  live on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was  right, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go  back and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over  your destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality  in which you don't want to be a part of. \",\"  oh, i see. electricity is a natural right & our wonderful government would -never- cut off the power to the people they were besieging. are you really this dumb, or just acting like it for the sake of argument?  jason \",\"[... a bunch of well-meaning (maybe) cynnical text about screw-thread  sizes, the rights of people to have their own standards,  and the non-right of the gov. to regulate screw-threads...]  Well, as funny as your little comment may seem, it has very little to do with your personal privacy as a citizen, and about the governemnt being able to look at everything you have ever typed into a computer at one point or another.

I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the  future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.    There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger  of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan.  10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition,  shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic  rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll  limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent  with your note.    First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Second, publication of some latter-day \\\"scientific study\\\" doesn't  alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my  interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.    Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Fourth, as often happens with these things, the \\\"study\\\" doesn't  support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions  anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older  body of lies, omissions, and distortions.    Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on  countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND  BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this  present \\\"study\\\" dubious, to say the least.    Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat  (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you  should be better aware than most people how \\\"progress\\\" -- in  designing \\\"studies\\\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our  ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree  on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30  years to create \\\"studies\\\" \\\"proving\\\" that pornography causes crime.   More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s  clearly indicate the contrary.    Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Tenth, another reason to doubt all such \\\"studies\\\" is that human  behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The  attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the  resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.    Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Twelfth, the \\\"study\\\" is also worthless because it incorporates  figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but  basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social  benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a  criminal offense.    Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials  quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are  many), are correct in this instance:  the \\\"study\\\" is meaningless  because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    And because of that, Adrian, even if the \\\"study\\\" were valid, it  wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that  anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however,  whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's  permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists  themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed  people to go out and buy their first gun \\\"while they still can\\\".   Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the \\\"shooting fraternity\\\"  viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate,  ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in  the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys,  and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we  probably manufacture at least that many every year.  The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly  aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what  their real motives are.    Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way,  it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic;  the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the  self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing  this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a  quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \\\"half life\\\"  of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna  be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.  As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law  provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I  will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is  that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands  -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can  only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given  both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics  and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.    So what's the point?    L.

It is the same price as the stealth card. Plus it is also based on S3 928 chip the newest and fastest chip from s3.  Everyone, if you are looking for a card, SEE THE APRIL ISSUE OF PC MAGAZINE FOR THEIR REVIEW.   They noted this person's problem with dos. The stealth card is not a very good dos performer. The Actix card is rated the best in this chip class (non local bus). It got glowing reports from the magazine (was a best buy) and I called them directly and they just updated their windows drivers last week! They have a bulletin board to get the latest drivers.  Though somone posted that this bbs was at 2400.   AT any rate, the Actix graphics engine ultra outperforms all the other cards in the 928 class (based on the winmark results).  If you are looking for the all around best dos/windows performance  check out the actix card. Their 1-800 number is 927-5557.  P.S. The article in pc magazine noted that if you are a regular dos user (ie: games) then you should also check out the 801 chip from s3. It apparently scores just as well and in many cases slightly better in dos than the 928 chip (ie: stealth and actix cards.) They have \\\"comparable\\\" windows performance and are cheaper to buy.\",\"  Bingo.  Nothing evil at all.

1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration camps, the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion  had grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of Dro  (the butcher) who is the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5  million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council  was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was  recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily  formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the  principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the  Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination  of the Jews.  This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \\\"encore\\\" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.

As they say over here, You Know It Makes Sense.   Cheers  Simon\",\"G-d has nothing to do with it. Some of the land was in fact given to the   Jews by the United Nations, quite a bit of it was purchased from Arab   absentee landlords. Present claims are based on prior ownership (purchase   from aforementioned absentee landlords) award by the United Nations in the   partition of the Palestine mandate territory, and as the result of   defensive wars fought against the Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians, et al.  *** First, I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the   idea that the West Bank is theirs. Since,  however, I agree with those who   claim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West   bank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion   to attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis   promptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining   possession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats   national suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it   is that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them   and the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs   continues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they   can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West   Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is   the small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West   Bank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even   leftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't   going to propose giving up Jerusalem. If he did, he'd get run out of town   on a rail. \",\"Macintosh IIsi, 3/40, 80ns.

The greatest danger of the escrow database, if it were kept on disk, would be the chance that a complete copy could somehow leak out.  You can design lots of protection, but with enough corruption a complete copy is always possible.   Storing it on paper or something very hard to copy at once may actually make sense.  Or a medium that can't be copied -- for example, something with very slow access times or which leaves a destructive trail if it is even read.  Of course then it's hard to backup.  However, I think the consequences of no backup -- the data is not there when a warrant comes -- are worse than the consequences of a secret backup.  An audit trail that reveals when data has been access, that *can't* be erased by the humans involved, is also necessary.\",\" It wasn't especially prominent, as I recall.

He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but he's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he were more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's only a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though not through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided  to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the award goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be MVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the league's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the  rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer goals than Hartford.

There is a role for short chain fatty acids in patients with colostomies and rectal pouches that are inflammed (Short is butyrate and shorter).  There may be a role for treatment of UC with Short chain fatty acids, and I am looking  forward to the upcoming AGA meeting in Boston to see what people are doing.    You raise a hypothesis about the studies and restriction of other fatty acids.  You should contact the authors directly about that or even write a letter to the editor - it is a good point.

It is about drug resistant microorganisms & the history of antibiotics.

If the system is really secure, then why does the government have to keep the algorithm secret?  There are plenty of encryption algorithms that don't depend upon nondisclosure to be secure, so why in the world use one that does?  There are reasons, of course, but I certainly can't think of any honest ones.  Next, you assume we can \\\"trust\\\" the escrow houses. But the last time I checked, EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure, corruption, and even fabrication, of supposedly secure data. The govt is saying \\\"Yeah, but NOW we're serious, so you can trust us.\\\"  Bullcrypt.   And finally, although you didn't state it explicitly, you implicitly assume that the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable. The case in Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately fraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this score.  Remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers, right?  As others have pointed out, the current proposal will, if deployed, render truly secure encryption much more expensive and inconvenient than Uncle Sam's brand. Who will be able to afford, and be sufficiently motivated, to purchase this expensive, inconvenient higher protection?  Somebody with lots of extra cash...

The article starts with \\\"A leader of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible.\\\" O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research \\\"is a real question for me.\\\" O'Connor said \\\"everything is fair game,\\\" including \\\"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry, chopping management of the space station program at some NASA facilities around the country, working closely with the Russian space station Mir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the manned space shuttle fleet.\\\"  O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost.  The Post says O'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I listened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connor talked about how the White House wants three options, sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC, modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch Core [\\\"wingless Orbiter\\\"] @ JSC. Later, in response to a reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a \\\"moderate\\\" cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not the \\\"high cost\\\" option as Sawyer wrote).  The article goes on to describe the other two options as \\\"one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure.\\\"\",\"  That still doesn't mean we should cheer their deaths.

This day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy U.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.  The short version is that his testimony was consistent with the opening statements for the prosecution.  Cooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington) on August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation with five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was using night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up into two teams of three people.  The six later met at an observation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies Cooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to scout further possible surveillance sites.  Cooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into a gully to see, \\\"whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.\\\" Striker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking loudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.  They ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the \\\"fern field\\\"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance team had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should take cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy target and might be \\\"shot in the back.\\\"  As Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the road from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.  At this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to \\\"fend him off with his gun.\\\"  [It is unclear whether this means he clubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then took cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not noticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan got up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, \\\"Stop!  U.S. Marshal!\\\"  Harris then \\\"...brought the weapon around at hip level and fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw Bill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.\\\"  Cooper fired at Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon to bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then heard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the direction of the shots, yelled, \\\"You son of a bitch!\\\" and ran toward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him from directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the cabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward the cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two fingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and then his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the other three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large burst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.  On cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of throwing rocks into the gulley, asking, \\\"You wanted to lure that dog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?\\\"  Nevin also pointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had claimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him. Cooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and decided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the cross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an armed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at him [no answer was available].  Friday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.  Notes: There was no coverage of protestors.  Drew ============================================================== \",\"Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday      Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader. \\\"What could be better,\\\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging?      \\\"It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,\\\" announced Ryne Sandberg.  \\\"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to win.      \\\"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\\\"      The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.      Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center.  \\\"Cool Papa\\\" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone grounded out to second, ending the threat.        \\\"Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\\\"  So came the analysis from Frank Chance.      The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs, Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense. He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.      Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph.      Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st      Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday. The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of first in this wacky season.      Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2 Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday. The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3-2.  \\\"We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed,\\\" remarked Lou Brock.  \\\"I don't see why we can't win this division.\\\"      The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first. -------------------------------------------------------------------      New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs, now 2 back - but in 4th!     \\\"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a pitcher's park like this,\\\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith Hernandez added that \\\"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year, and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\\\"  The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.      Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the .500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins, and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go. ------------------------------------------------------------------      San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5):      Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw, \\\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\\\"      Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13. Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the National League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace. They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.      In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score. The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely. -------------------------------------------------------------------      San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the trade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.      Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after 10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home, and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):      Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \\\"Normally,\\\" Drysdale remarked, \\\"I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't Davis will get decked once.\\\"      The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away, with center field at 420 feet.  \\\"It's as if some three-year-old threw a tantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit home runs',\\\" remarked Roy Campanella.      The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway, Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings, according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the Astros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent. Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.      \\\"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\\\" he explained.      \\\"How can we do that,\\\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.      \\\"They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time.\\\"      The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.      \\\"We're mostly a power team,\\\" remarked Ron Cey.  \\\"Jackie and, when he plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other plays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I guess that's why they're so successful there.\\\"  Indeed, it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.

Furthermore, am I wrong in interpreting the sampling rate (from the player's point of view) as being the same thing as the data rate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium?  Does this mean that the data rate (related to the rotational speed of the disk) has  changed since 1983?

I'm pretty much oblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it from someone else.  However, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the Rockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation. This is because the MPU used \\\"speed buffering\\\" instead of having a 16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking conditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the \\\"speed buffering\\\" works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial port board.  Hope this helps...

The existing drive is currently a Western Digital as well, and is working fine, but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave relationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup.  The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0  The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991 They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact configuration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone). There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are for setting up the master/slave.  Originally, the drive in the machine had none.  Currently, I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.  When booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does flicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.   Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, I would not even know how to do that.

Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically     reduces a woman's chances of getting vaginal candida, a yeast infection.   For the year-long study, researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical     Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recruited 13 women who suffered from  chronic yeast infections. For the first 6 months, the women each day ate 8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second  6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the     women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection  were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.      The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.   It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The    researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some     brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus          thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used   in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a          protective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to   try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists      acidophilus in its contents.                                             --- end ---                                                ===================================  InfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92   THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED   ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS   MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

I bought a ViewSonic 6FS instead.  Another great monitor, IMHO. \",\"  I originally wrote to the person who asked this question personally, but decided to post the information I had on the topic.   I spoke to the pastor of my parish (Catholic) recently,  by coincidence, on this subject.  His explaination was that  while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the  Church as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church  recoginizes itself as a community of believers, members of the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable to each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island, there are many places in the world that do not have priests availible for marriages on a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without the priest being present, but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one comes through the area.     I remember a religion teacher in high school saying that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple as much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus, married couples have some responsibility to the community to stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the community.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with one another--the community should be able to rely on that  couple to be as one.   While couples may marry without witnesses, they  may NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An  anulment is simply an admission of the church that what they had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage at all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves anulments a half-hour later!!   I tend to agree with the response back there that said couples become married as soon as they consumate their marriage, but I would add that couples should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they intended to be married, assuming they were both willing partners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared to raise any children they may have as a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a commitment, I believe, in God's eyes.

If a player is on the ice when his team scores a lot of goals and only allows a few goals, he must be doing something right. It is especially useful to compare between teammates- as they play for the same team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equally good players.  It can be adjusted- with varying degrees of success to compare between players on different teams.  I agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics- but how useful are the ones that you suggest??  Total ice time would be very useful- it is a missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before.  Somehow measuring the quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless.  It would be a better stat for evaluating coaching- ie are the players given quality ice time actually their talented ones?  A very good player could be given low amounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who doesn't recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of quality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that thinks he is an effective player.  This stat would be much more flawed than +/- and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent.  +/- is a useful stat.  It is quite useful in evaluating player talent. You are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see that being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed is a very positive thing- and should be evaluated as such.\",\"He sounds really cute, Morte!

These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm and Oberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of a spot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface.  In escence, the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the four sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of the crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional to the position of the spot on the detector's face.  Let's try some ASCII graphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)                  -------------------------> 1              |                       |              |                       |       |\\\\            -----   cathode 1         |       |  \\\\            XXXXX                     ________| +  \\\\            XXXXX|                            |      \\\\        -------     light >XXXXX|                            |        \\\\_____ divider __ output            XXXXX|     |                      |        /      -------            XXXXX|-----| |--                  |      /           |            XXXXX|   + |    |         ________| -  /           1 + 2            XXXXX|         --- gnd    |       |  /            XXXXX|         \\\\ /        |       |/            XXXXX| anode              |            XXXXX                     |            ----- cathode 2           |              |                       |              |                       |              --------------------------> 2  If the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light, then the position of the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina- tion (the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power).  When this circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light, then the way of \\\"tuning\\\" to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal, light the LED for an equal time and sample that signal separately.  The difference between the two is the position of the LED.  Hamamatsu photonics sells linear and 2-D lateral photoeffect detectors, and they also sell the required signal processing electronics.

Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that goaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're Montreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it; he literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides, Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.  Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more).  Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than  five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME  ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear  the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to  play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.  Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this article, if possible.   I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who) in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in regardless.   Yep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second, IMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.  Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their zone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red  Army.    But I still hate the team.  On the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a powerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit.  Same goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is waving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.  New Jersey was overmatched, Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.  Mario is unbelievable, and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.

This may be a dangerous thing to do.  It is my opinion that most educated or well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government. This should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough time will tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was  created for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line. That and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented press portrays a group of people as \\\"nuts\\\" or crazies, a violation of those people's civil rights seem justified.   Since we, as American's, have the  gurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the 2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk  voted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with domocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.   Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore the  official press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat to public safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information. So far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very agency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to their advantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If they were portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justification what so ever of doing what they did.    So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny, may mislead the public from the truth of the matter.  Just as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Dalton leads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's (in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to be unconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least). And since, I believe the only reason ATF was involved in this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to  find out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA. It would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly unconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement).    **************************************************************************** The above opinions are mine and mine only.

It appears both conservatives and liberals prefer to cold war until you win, then nurse the enemy back to health for another go around.  It's like subsidizing the wealthy countries (Japan, Germany, etc.) with free defense, and then trade-warring with them because of the economic competition.  It's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke.  I ask myself, what law could we pass to prevent government from doing stupid, frivilous things with OUR money?  Then I think, the Constitution was supposed to do that.  Could someone please tell me what legitimate constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries?  Seriously.

has changed considerably in recent years. See the discussion of \\\"high-power rocketry\\\" in the rec.models.rockets frequently-asked-questions list.  This is not hardware you can walk in off the street and buy; you need proper certification.  That can be had, mostly through Tripoli (the high- power analog of the NAR), although the NAR is cautiously moving to extend the upper boundaries of what it considers proper too.  You need special FAA authorization, but provided you aren't doing it under one of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that, it's not especially hard to arrange.  As with model rocketry, this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handled properly.  Proper handling takes more care, and you need a lot more empty air to fly in, but it's basically just model rocketry scaled up.  As with model rocketry, the high-power people use factory-built engines, which eliminates the major safety hazard of do-it-yourself rocketry.\",\"= = = = = =  The only thing about the 300ZX turbo and new Supra is they're about $10K or  more over his budget...\",\"I have a Onkyo integrated amplifier that I am looking to get rid of.  60w/ch  works great  Integra series  not a problem   Asking $100 OBO   If your interested call me at 317-743-2656  or email this address.

Roy was the reason the game was tied... and that would *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool.  Hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ... Both Dionne's and Bellows' shots were misplayed by Hextall, but just because his gaffes were early in the game, no one seems to care. Roy stood on his head  for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from  end-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by  Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall  for most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero  because Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities.  Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very  well, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over  Bellows' stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all  those opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them. Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ...    Sure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against an explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.   I disagree. Roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole night.  The defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic, Nolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.   This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities, as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.   And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. Roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5, when you consider the defense, or lack of one, that played in front of him for most of the season.   The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans. Why should they read the papers? They played 58 minutes of \\\"Burnsian\\\" hockey to shut down Quebec. All they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the  extra 2.  Red Light to face Quebec...rubbish. That's a guaranteed way to end the series 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ? The fans, the media, and Racicot, perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team.   If you mean the goal should never have gone in, because there should never have been an OT, then I agree. But the goal itself was a great piece of work by Young. Roy had both the near and far posts covered, but Young flipped the puck up under Roy's arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all.\",\" Even if they outlawed private posession of firearms, there would be no moral force behind that law; I imagine compliance would be low.\",\"FOR SALE   1 Sega Genesis (including all cables, manuals, boxes)  1 controller  9 games, including all manuals and boxes:   Sonic the Hedgehog   Road Rash   John Madden Football '92   N.H.L.

They could have beaten us if either:  * Their rocket hadn't blown up on the pad thus setting them back,  and/or  * A Saturn V went boom.

Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would depend upon whether the Soviets tried to go.  Setting up a lunar base would have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value of going to Mars (at least in the short run).

Questions to Israelis   Dear Josh  I appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions.  Having said that, I am not totally happy with your answers.  1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards identify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S. citizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are just trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic country where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or religious identity to any public official who so requests ?  2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all kinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy. You did not respond to my question.  3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is interesting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear weapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ?  4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a Ma'ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about cases like Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about those about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and imprisoned.  5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status of the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it I understand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one for the occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law). The law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron, it seems. If so, why doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ?  6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to return conflicts with what I was told, namely that hundreds of thousands of non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under Israel control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented from returning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who also left, for example to Europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed to return. How can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ? Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in his homeland ?  7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to that information, Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all inhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh, about 50,000 people.  These expulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other atrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book by Israeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, published by Cambridge University Press. Is this book available in your library ?  8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in Israeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is very little evidence available about that. As much as I know, many Arabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but are not accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not want Arabs ?  9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was whether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to discourage intermarriage. You did not address this question but evaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants to keep it what way'. I am certain that if only religious communities in the U.S. would be asked, they would gladly abolish civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests to officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by a secular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory.   I would be glad to have some more input from you after these comments.\",\"I was watching the Detroit-Minnesota game last night and thought I saw an octopus on the ice after Ysebaert scored to tie the game at two.

We are doing computer science honours, and our project is to do a 'graphical simulator for a finite state automata'.  Basically, the program must draw a diagram of a FSA from a textual grammar, showing circles for states, and labeled arc's in-between.  The problem is working out the best way to layout the states, and draw the arc's in-between so that as few arc's as possible cross each other.  If anyone has any suggestions/algorithms/bug-free ready to compile C code :)  that might help us, it would be much appreciated.

For example, since Apple never used the Motorola 68008 and  68010 in the Mac these chips are not listed. Years only appear with dead CPUs  and indicate first to last year used as a CPU. Cache note:  both IBM and Mac use caches external to the CPUs. These external  caches increase the speed of the CPU but are not a part of it.  In most of  the present Macs there are external caches built-in while with IBM they are  optional {Though machines are generally sold with them installed}.  Since  there are many different external caches {CPU-Mac and IBM; SCSI, video, disk  and static RAM-Mac}, each having a different effect on CPU performance, and  they are machine {32KB static RAM cache in IIci, IIfx, and IIvx}, seller  {cache card installed in some IIcis} or expansion {IIci cache cards go up to  128KB} dependent, I have decided to leave them out of the list.

CPUs Comparison List As a general rule of thumb Motorola chips are faster than Intel chips at the  same frequency {030/25 ~= 386/33; 040/25 ~= 486dx/50}, but Intel has chips at  higher frequencies than Motorola, so this evens out.

The 4MB limit on the 68000 Macs brings it  down to the 80186 and lower chips, otherwise it would compare to the 80286.}  286        ~ 68020 {hardware segmenting vs. 68020's 32-bit ALU and these chips  come have no usable built-in MMU unlike their successors [80386, 68030].

The use of the hardware segmenting and their 16-bit nature put the 286 between  the 60000 and 68030 in features and the LC's 16-bit data path strenghthens the  286 ~ 68020 comparison.}  386       ~ 68030 {Two 32-bit chips with MMUs, and protected memory.  A/UX 3.0  is at present the only Mac OS to use the 68030's protected memory feature for  apps.  System 7.x uses this feature to protect a RAM disk created by the  Memory control panel but this is supported only on Powerbooks and Quadras.   The Color Classic and LCII 16-bit hardware data paths makes the 68030s in them  comparative to 386sxs.}  486sx   ~ 68LC040 {same as 486 and 68040 without the FPU; used as a low cost  solution for people who do not need the FPU.

All present Macs support the use of  32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw  allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y- bit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y  independently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63  dpi [12\\\" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including  autosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz  vertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser  Aug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and  IIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit  color (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).   To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display  capability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit  color.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX  will change this. In addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one  monitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same  thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree  of overlap of the pictures. VRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of   built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit  color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display.  Sound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became   standard with the SE/30.  IBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system  interacts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing  BIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation of clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program  interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer  Jawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a  standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is  actually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like  Mac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes,  especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present  things are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver  and monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS,  and monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with  an IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2  486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0  and still have ALL the colors one started out with}. Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster  processors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD  ROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).   MDA: Monocrome Display Adapter  original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text. CGA: Color Graphics Array  320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes. EGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array  640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions   could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes. VGA:  Video Graphics Array*  320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are   the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a   18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock  (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals  from EGA/CGA etc.  MCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array*  subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA   and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).    Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models. SVGA:  Super VGA*  This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch   all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer   using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating  as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a   standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things  are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution  of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since   1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600,   some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually   at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital   Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example],   some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting   factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were:   8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a   64K \\\"window\\\", etc. Other non-SVGA standards:  8514/a:  IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions   like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations   from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do   not have interlacing.  TMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some  do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD. XGA:  eXtended Graphics Array  newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones   are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at   1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes. XGA-2  Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in  Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area  fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co-  exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be   far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth   isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other   companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh   rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual   discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2. *some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.  Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.    Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the   end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software  drivers.  \\\"Fast SCSI-1\\\" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode  {see SCSI-2 for details}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast  SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in    hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are  4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and  15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can  use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such  is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called \\\"fast SCSI-1\\\".   16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics  but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a  different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which  makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}. Mac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though   Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager  needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI  interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast   asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2  controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1))   though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port   interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus   Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some  Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard   and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager. IBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with   systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.  Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers  out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications  which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.  Mac Memory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin   8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs  could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity   feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx   used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new   72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.  The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every  memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will  not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.  Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs   had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris   650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that   allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same   size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting   in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109). Printers, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard. Monitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs.  PDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE,   Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.    Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650:   4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with  the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in   IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows   through put down. NuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,  and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:  40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and   Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a   Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet   to DMA. NuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:  ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7\\\" instead of the   old 12\\\". QuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's   VLBus - \\\"Architecture is identical to that of VLBus\\\" (Byte 10/92:128).  Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development. CPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,    Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at   the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to   dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each   NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with   8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.  IBM Memory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac- like SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.  HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:  MFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited  only used with smaller [\\u00b2 60mb] hard drives. IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.  currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive.  ESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface  ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in  many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of  hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1.   BUS interfaces {New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working  with old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).} ISA  8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a  16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105).  1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,  hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards  aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.}  while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's  showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit  (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.   MCA {Micro Channel}  IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; \\\"allows use of more than one CPU in a computer\\\"   (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components   involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA   and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido). EISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}  32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to   self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable   interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use. VESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS}  Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit}  250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus   mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for   video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of  their patents (Mel Martinez). QuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture  (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines  (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development. PCI  Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace   ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development.  OSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.] and multiple application use.} Mac 512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows  Apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw,  menu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require  clone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires  access to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM  chips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support  interface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS  has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and  therefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control  over hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with  some of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a  totally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon  Wtte). 6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy,   cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.    Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program   interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of   AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a   24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as   real RAM is below 8MB. 6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers. 6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X. 7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard   to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present   non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on  system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking   within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing   can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be   accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X},   Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable   IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType   support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present   machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is   both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit   mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last   'free' OS. 7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than   7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode   on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension.   Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades  {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.  [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system   fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any   RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all   fonts from the system file.] A/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and   a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS   is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac   ROMs.  Price: $709. Note: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats  including the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and  DCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd'  and AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most  still play.  IBM  Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for  programmers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.   Since hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition,  what little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}   This results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or  EPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to  better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which  is harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it  reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware  support is needed. Side note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing  all feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing  its Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 (\\\"Undocumented Windows\\\") and  \\\"There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to  abort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present\\\" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92  #201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC  judicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no  action.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of  choosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has  turned down Microsoft's copyright of \\\"Windows\\\" which would allow it to charge  a fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93). MicroSoft OSes DOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier   with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program   must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS   Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit   Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in  DOS 4.0. DOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk   defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for   networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99}   (Byte April 1993:44-46). DOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93). Window 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to   deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to  run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the  equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface].  This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac  programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and  still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed  is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman).  Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS  counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108). Window 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base   requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx.   Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92). Windows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).    Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1   with built-in peer to peer networking support. Windows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the   swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in   the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the   reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM   but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92).  This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric   multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in  networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even  though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor  is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993  (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993  (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495  (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93). Other OSes PC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS   6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93). DR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression}   and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later   version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple   file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92). OS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM,  60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded,   multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file   to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}.   IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this   (InfoWorld Oct 26/92). AIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS. NeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.  Beta out, final   version to be out by May 25, 1993. Solaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric   multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with   tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and   communication package.  Client: $795,  50 users server: $1,995, 1000s users  server: $5,995.  Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195. Mac 7.1 [working name: Star Trek]:  Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel   Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM   (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run   on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps   will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to   Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow   progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in   late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.}  PowerPC Rumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92;  MacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA  video (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week  3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps. Apple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and  to have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to  sale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser  9/92:146)} (MacWeek 3/22/93). PowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on  PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain  (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard  drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993.  Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993. Pink [Taligent OS]: Expecting delivery in 1994 (Wall Street Journal 1/12/92)   and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and   PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93). Windows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details. Solaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the  Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state   that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for details NeXTStep: possible port see IBM OS section for details.  OS Number Crunching (Mel Park) Mac  Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard  Apple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an  FPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or  taking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are  handled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal  representation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment  of 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and  the FPU programmed directly.  IBM  Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when  emulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever  compiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers  exceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS  prompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this  better.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS,  Windows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.  Networking [Includes printing] WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially  if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer. Mac Hardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.   LocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for  each machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to  include very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in  Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at  about $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and  transceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet. The Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet  interface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a  network option since 1989. Software: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can  use variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS  as well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open,  Banyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing  machines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows  typical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version  will have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993  (MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC  Pathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software  built-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra.  Printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in  the chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the  chooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers. Printing bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.  {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}  IBM   Hardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing. Software: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk  protocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}. Each of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible  with the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to  that product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more  forgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest,  {~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and  offers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more  complex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac  finder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;   InfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93) Printing {Very OS dependent} DOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port,   and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written   software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly   implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one   software program to the next. Windows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing \\\"jobs\\\"   in the print queue, but it always lists printers as \\\"active\\\"... even if they   are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers   on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine   which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like   and intelligent about this. OS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS. Printing bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do  not have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and  not that of the OS involved.  Price issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features  than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars  by both worlds. The IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware  standarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to  handle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac  hardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,   built-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and  NuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent  equipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs  which cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.  Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993. All Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.  Except where  noted, monitor is extra and a built-in monitor interface is provided {no card  needed except for 24-bit color display}. IBM planned a $1,200 386SLC/25MHz model with a 60MB hard drive and color VGA  monitor {~VRAM} (MacWeek 8/17/92) {sounds like a Color Classic without SCSI-1,  sound support, built-in network support, FPU socket, built-in expansion to  16-bit color, etc}.

I'm not sure, but I believe that this rating only applies to the flight software.  Also keep in mind that it was *not* achieved through the use of sophisticated tools, but rather through a 'brute force and ignorance' attack on the problem during the Challenger standdown - they simply threw hundreds of people at it and did the whole process by hand.  I would not consider receiving a 'Warning' status on systems which are not yet in use would detract much (if anything) from such a rating -- I'll have to get the latest copy of the guidelines to make sure (they just issued new ones, I think).  Also keep in mind that the SEI levels are concerned primarily with control of the software process; the assumption is that a well controlled process will produce good software.  Also keep in mind that SEI Level 5 is DAMNED HARD.

Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else, one can get too much of a good thing.   Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries, essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency her, necessarily.    Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly ache) would be expected.     These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.    People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends upon what it is about the compound that \\\"pisses off\\\" their body. Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard, causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it.    See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory problems are not serious. They can be deadly.  and brain damage.   The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin, and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.   poisoning.   Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating , say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home, plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of things.  But it might be the MSG.    If noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.   Anyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their responses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.\",\" Of course it is!     And this is your opinion.

Status: R  Redwood City, CA (API) -- A tense stand-off entered its third week today as authorities reported no progress in negotiations with charismatic cult leader Steve Jobs.  Negotiators are uncertain of the situation inside the compound, but some reports suggest that half of the hundreds of followers inside have been terminated.  Others claim to be staying of their own free will, but Jobs' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.  In conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflicting information on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the industry.  At times, he has claimed to \\\"have hardware which will blow anything else away\\\", while more recently he claims they have stopped manufacturing their own.  Agents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is equipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and possibly Canon equipment.  The siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to other cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations, including a young man who will identify himself only as \\\"Bill\\\" and claims to be the \\\"MS-iah\\\".  Former members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak hesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work 20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There were frequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of \\\"interpersonal computing\\\" which rejects traditional roles.  Late-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on federal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blares throughout the night.  Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his own apocalyptic prophecies, a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers carry Jobs' own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling \\\"I want to welcome you to the 'Next World' \\\".\",\"I'd appreciate it greatly if someone could E-mail me the following: (if you only know one, that's fine) 1) Specs for the 68040 (esp. how it compares to the Pentium) 2) Specs for the 68060 with estimated cost, release date, etc...

True, but that's beside the point. This is a fact about an abstract model of what the GUI users are doing, not about what they actually *are* doing. This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer* of the system. (NB: some users may see it, too, but only when they put aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.)  I'm not saying that the programmer's perspective is evil or stunted. After all, that's what I do, too! I am saying that UI designers must carefully distinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models, and they must ultimately serve the user of the system, not the builder of the system.       I don't recall the actual stats, but something like 1 in 5 people can be    categorized as a \\\"symbol manipulator\\\".  It would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this claim. At any rate, I don't think this is evidence that 20% of users think like programmers. Bankers, financial analysts, structural engineers --- these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol manipulation. But what they do is not programming, and programming is not required to do what they do. \",\"long  The NRA is successful because (among a number of things), on the drop of a hat, they can get a congresspersons office flooded with postcards, faxes and phone calls.

Being a fairly experienced BMW and MZ-Mechanic, I just don't know what to  think about my Honda.  She was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to Daytona bike  week this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and  was running only on one cylinder.  I towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect  working order. No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look  very clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All  still within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a  slightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem),  but it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for  this bike.  Any syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone  the cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in  order to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the  wear of my pistons??

We must be reading different public opinion polls. I agree that the misguided public would like to see assault weapons banned (mainly because they are being lied to by the media about the frequency of their use in violent crime ... ~1%), but if public opinion were so dead-set against the RKBA you can bet that idiots like Metzenbaum and Schumer would be seeing their foolish bills getting passed through Congress a LOT easier than they are. And as governments go broke and can no longer protect their citizens you can bet that the American people will start to really appreciate the usefulness of firearms. Contrary  to what you might think, time is probably on OUR side, not YOURS.    Yeah, right. Don't hold your breath. My condolences on the discovery of uncomfortable resilience in your mammary glands, but this has nothing to do with the issue at hand.  ... ridiculous tripe deleted ...     Yeah, the liberal press doesn't like us much, but you can't really expect coherent thought from them anyway. Their opinions are based more on a desire to appear politically correct than on facts (which are generously provided by the FBI, if they'd bother to put on their Birkenstocks and go to the library to read them). Most of my friends are anti-gun, and without exception NONE of them bases his/her opinions on facts. They would rather believe (despite all evidence to the contrary) that disarming law-abiding citizens would make the world more civilized, when all it really does is make us all sheep. They  would rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about how society has driven the criminal to rob, rape, and murder. They  support spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scum who have already demonstrated that they have no regard for society or its laws. They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun control (NYC,DC) have the worst crime and areas with little gun control (VT,NH,ID) have very little crime in comparison. But they have to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confront the fact that law-abiding citizens who own guns are not the ones that are causing most of the trouble in society. Oh no, we certainly can't accept that! But I guess I have faith that when crime starts making significant inroads into their neighborhoods and starts directly hurting them and their families, they will probably whistle a different tune. They just better hope it isn't too late then.    Hmmm. I wasn't expecting company tonight.

They were both fairly impressive.  The first one was a 64 gray scale \\\"movie\\\" of Casablanca, it was 1.3MB and had 11 minutes of 13 fps video.  It was a little grainy but not bad at all.  The second one I saw was only 3 minutes but it had 8 bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1.2MB.  I consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore.  But unlike many  other formats out there, you do end up losing resolution.  I don't know what kind of software/hardware was used for creating the \\\"movies\\\" I saw but the guy that showed them to me said it took 5-15 minutes per frame to generate.

May 4, 1982 - Cambridge, Massachusetts  Orhan Gunduz, the Turkish honorary consul in Boston, would not bow   to the Armenian terrorist ultimatum that he give up his title of   \\\"honorary consul\\\".

He   survives... but falls silent. One of the most revolting \\\"triumphs\\\" in   the senseless, mindless history of Armenian terrorism. Such a murder   brings absolutely nothing - except an ego boost for the murderer   within the Armenian terrorist underworld, which is already wallowing   in self-satisfaction.

JCAG and SDPA claim responsibility.   Source: Edward K. Boghosian, \\\"Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity Meeting,\\\" The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18.  ATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties, including the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both Armenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the  Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during the 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these political groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.  The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of the Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed by younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks of ASALA...  Voicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian people, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal... Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement  was Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam  Abu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued  support of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause,  pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be  open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr.  Abu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that  his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that this policy will continue. \\\"The doors of our camps are always open to  Armenian freedom fighters,\\\" he affirmed.  Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet; two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of the Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations, a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.  More than significant was the large number of messages received by the  organizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary Movement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist Labor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.                   SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM  Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will continue to \\\"reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,\\\" to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag \\\"Bureau.\\\" The message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement, open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.  The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the Greek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence. The headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...

In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give   the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!  (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of  pages, please ask by sct)      I really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924) What I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in the given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your groundless accussations, etc.    [...]      I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)  and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published  in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you  are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..    Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)    First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You  called Serdar Argic a liar!..  I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...  (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)    And now, you are lying again and talking about \\\"modified,re-published book\\\" (without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..  (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was   first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty    well suited theories', as usual)    And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who  wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number  and page numbers again for the library use, which are:                    949.6 R 198       and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215                           Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying \\\"it is  not possible...\\\" ..If not, what is your point?    Differences in the number of pages?  Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..  No need to use the same book size and the same letter   charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!    The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year  first published..   And you tried to hide the whole point..  the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about  how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given   by Serdar Argic exist!!   It was the issue, wasn't-it?      you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway?     You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a \\\"crap\\\"..

The last time I got stung by a bee I experienced the same reaction the first poster's brother did.  We went off to the doctor to see if I should worry about the fact that my foot was now about 3 times it's normal size.  (And itched!!!  Ow!)  He basically said I shouldn't this time, but that bee sting allergy was not something you tended to get aclimatized to, but were something that each time got progressively worse generally and that next time could be the time I go into anaphylactic shock.  Admittedly this was many years ago when I was young.  Since then I just make sure I don't get stung.  I also should carry a bee sting kit with me, but I don't.    This isn't scientific or proof, but this would lead me to believe it's not a different reaction, just a different degree of reaction.  Allergies work that way.  People have various reactions.  Sort of like diabetes, some people can get by with just monitoring their diet, others have to monitor their diet and use insulin sometimes while others have to watch their diet like a hawk and use insulin regularly.    I think MSG is probably similar...some people have allergic reactions to it.  Some people are allergic to fermented things and can't use soy sauce...but the chinese have been using it for centuries... that doesn't necessarily mean that it's safe for everyone.  \",\"you consider those I got from you to be such.

Baylor said after Wednesday's game that he wanted to shake up the lineup a little, because Bichette has been having a rough time defensively and Jerald Clark has not been hitting. He was true to his word; I went to Thursday's game and Gerald Young was in right and Daryl Boston (who has a very hot bat) was in left. Baylor was careful to say though that he didn't necessarily mean for these changes to be permanent but he wanted to give these other two a shot while Clark and Bichette were not playing well.  In defense of Bichette, it looks like right field in Mile High Stadium is a bitch to play. Some of the visiting outfielders have been having some problems too (although Bobby Bonilla made a great catch crashing into the wall to rob Daryl Boston of an extra base hit in Thursday's game)\",\"I'm selling $388 worth of chemicals for $100 or I'll split it in two for $50 dollars apeice. Aprox. 380 1oz bottles. Will make a great chem set.  Will pay shipping up to $15. If really interested I will mail a partial list.

In particular, I'm interested in finding out more about intravenous insulin injection for hepatic vein liver activation. (Whew! Wotta mouthful!)  Anything that smells like a pointer would be helpful: newsgroup, mailinglist, etc....  Many thanks. \",\"  If alcohol were again banned today, it would be MUCH more  difficult to manage a large-scale smuggling operation.   The cops now rank just a narrow notch below the military  in communications, intelligence gathering and firepower.   In a similar vein, the amount of marijuana smuggled into  this country has greatly decreased. This is because its  value-per-pound is very low when compared to cocaine or  heroin. It's simply not worth the risk, it's uneconomical.  Now, most reefer is domestic. There is less pressure on  the domestic producer (showy raids notwithstanding) and  thus it is economical. Of note though ... domestic reefer  is now very strong, so a small volume goes a long way.

I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X, but I have not seen it myself).    Currently, I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms, of which only three came with Motif. On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available.    The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5. True, I could buy another port of Motif, but that sort of ruins the whole idea of \\\"free\\\", doesn't it?

No information is required in the subject header line.   1. ARCHIE =========  The Archie is a service system to locate FTP places for requested files. It's appreciated that you will use Archie before asking help in the newsgroups.  Archie servers:   archie.au or 139.130.4.6             (Aussie/NZ)   archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100  (Finland/Eur.)   archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111  (GER.)   cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5             (Israel)   archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (JAPAN)   archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11      (Korea)   archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24  (TWN)   archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7  (UK/Ireland)   archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179    (USA [MD])   archie.unl.edu (password: archie1)    (USA [NE])   archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2         (USA [NY])   archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15     (USA [NJ])   archie.nz or 130.195.9.4           (New Zealand)  Connect to Archie server with telnet and type \\\"archie\\\" as username. To get help type 'help'. You can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call Archie without the burden of a telnet session. 'Xarchie' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc, vol. 27.  To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with subject \\\"help\\\" to \\\"archie\\\" account at any of above sites.  (Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000]. Connect to it and specify \\\"archie\\\" as the host name and \\\"archie\\\" as the username.)  ==========================================================================  2. Notes ======== (Excerpted from the FAQ article)  Please do *not* post or mail messages saying \\\"I can't FTP, could someone mail this to me?\\\"  There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message.  There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message to an automated server saying something like \\\"send comp.sources.unix/fbm\\\", and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.  ==========================================================================  3.

Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes ===========================================  Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help. Don't overuse mail servers.  There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these mail servers have a command like    path a_valid_return_e-mail_address to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.  DEC's FTPMAIL -------------   Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,   and having a line containing the word 'help'.   You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you   must follow in order to get the files you want.    Note that the \\\"reply\\\" or \\\"answer\\\" command in your mailer will not work   for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send   requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.   Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com   address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not   responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.  BITFTP ------   For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.   Send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info.  Lightwave 3D mail based file-server -----------------------------------   A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images   and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.   The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list   and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for   several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.    The server resides on a BBS called \\\"The Graphics BBS\\\".  The BBS is   operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1   908/469-0049.  It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144   V.32bis/V.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps.    If you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server,   please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address:   server@bobsbox.rent.com.    For information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message   to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in   the body of the message:     HELP     /DIR   And a help file describing how to use the server and a complete   directory listing will be sent to you via mail.  [ Now it includes the Cyberware head and shouders in TTDDD format! Check it  out, only if you can't use FTP! -- nfotis ]  INRIA-GRAPHLIB --------------   Pierre Jancene and Sabine Coquillart launched the inria-graphlib mail   server a few months ago.      echo help | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr    will give you a quick summary of what inria-graphlib contains and    how to browse among its files.      echo send contents | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr    will return the extended summary.    As an other example :      echo send cgrl from Misc | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr    will return the Computer Graphics Resource Listing mirrored from   comp.graphics.

There are previewers for xview and sunview,   also on gondwana.  TDDD ---- It's a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF, Rayshade, Imagine or vort objects. Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):    New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley   (worley@cup.portal.com)    I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format   called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,   from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely   distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.    In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file   with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the   objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially   on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various   object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,   Rayshade 4.0, or vort.

The P3D uses lisp with slight   extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp   interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to   have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.    The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon   Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D   without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.    The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:   Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,   Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from   VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.

And in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is  indicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a   perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might  make that he is unable to even leave the house.    In science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible  and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these  discoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata  --- the search for scope and the search for certainty.    If 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and  Leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither  of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since  they lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of  a rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus.  It was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid  grounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton  and Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great  deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost  through the mistakes they made.     These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and sci.psychology.  According to these posters  \\\"If it's not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science.\\\"  Taken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies  are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification  of science.    For one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology  results in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside  the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have  no chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that this  is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless,  it is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has  certainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish  arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment  --- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come  with anything worthwhile.    Furthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is one of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate questions because they can be readily handled by the currently fashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to those questions which seem to have fundamental significance.  For instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative. (One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many areas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions into a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's assertion that current scientific methods \\\"avoid all known errors.\\\")  I think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental  error in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the  others.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all  too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are  worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"SOMEONE PLEASE BUY THESE BOOKS!!!!!

We Catholics do believe that God's revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in the Bible can be and is passed on through the Tradition of the Church. It should be noted that the Tradition of the Church, otherwise known as Sacred Tradition, is not the same as ordinary human traditions. However, we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to the Church.  Public revelation, which is the basis of Catholic doctrine, ended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  Nothing new can be added.  Theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications that were not recognized previously, so that the Council of Nicea could define statements about the theology of the Trinity and the Incarnation that were not explicitly stated in the Bible and had been disputed before the council, but there was no new revelation at Nicea or at any subsequent council.  Cardinal Newman's _An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine_, written while he was still an Anglican, is an excellent discussion of of this point.  It was recently reprinted as a Doubleday Image Books paperback with some related shorter works under the title _Conscience, Consensus, and the Development of Doctrine_. ------- Marty Helgesen Bitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu\",\"I've been following the Giants closely over the off-season -- newspapers, notesgroup, etc -- but I had my first up close and personal last night at the Stick.  After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was  very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).  It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.  The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb. McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball. So on & so forth.  I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.  For myself, I think the fresh start of Magowan/Baker/etc has really wiped out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor in helping them significantly improve over last year.\",\"Just to remark that I have heard that David Koresh has risen from  the dead.

I am, however,  a devoted Quicken user, and I can tell you how to set up the weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly transactions.  First use the Memorize feature (CTRL-M) to record the recurring transactions.  Next, define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions and specify the frequency that it should be used (i.e. monthly).  Quicken will/can not automatically make the transactions for you, but now all you do is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be entered at once.  Additionally if you are using the Bill Minder, it will remind you when each transaction group is due.  For example, you could have three transaction groups.  One for payments at the beginning of the month, middle of the month, and one for quarterly payments.  I hope this helps.\",\" I totally agree.  But how do you propose we take government back?  They obviously don't listen to the people or want the people to know who is responsibile for what (a person telnetted the site of the Clipper chip release, to see what the entity 'clipper' was, and got a few lists. BUt when another person tried a bit later, the commands were disabled) Does not sound like an Administration that wants to have any accountability or information they don't control given to the people.  The secret development and implimentation of the Clipper Chip decision further backs that up.

What kind of memory is stable/reliable enough, non-volatile enough and independent enough (of outside battery power) to last say, 10 years or more, in the life of a vehicle?  I'm amazed that anything like this could be expected to work for this length of time (especially in light of all the gizmos I work with that are doing good to work for 2 months without breaking down somehow).  Side question:  how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with a replaced odometer that starts over at 0 miles, after say 100/200/300K actual miles.  Looks like fraud would be fairly easy - for the price of a new odometer, you can say it has however many miles you want to tell the buyer it has.

Neto):  This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to do with this.  Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.  That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays, or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination.  Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.  The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h, MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek, this is 12.  As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case.  We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of course, I could say \\\"Buy all you want, we'll support more.\\\" -- \",\"MJM>HI, I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related MJM>subjects.

We were able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of the Palestinian's popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid - currently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous statement: \\\"You look for me !\\\", i.e., I'am not making any more efforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid's point of view, Palestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew or the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the Palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly MERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from residents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his government's and his party's lack of action for human rights and peace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether they would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists' perspective this is the best government because it is THEIR government, regardless of what it does.  These members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the future of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to dictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step towards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin's government, and from their point of view the expulsions were a marginal byproduct of this \\\"government of peace\\\", which need not disturb the routine course of events. Likewise the \\\"Rabinic\\\" policies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets and the significant increases in the number of persons injured in the suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.  But the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces itself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has lost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian workers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel Aviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing to propose except separation: Let's cut ourselves off from the Palestinians, let's build a fence so high that they won't be able to harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a fence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.  Meron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz (4-3-93): \\\"...The liberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical separation and 'the future of the territories', must come to understand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab workers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement designed for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that their ideological support for separation only provides 'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <status quo>.  Enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the ruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears its burden. [.....].  \\\"Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first' is a liberal, humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether this position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off responsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to thus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. It is very easy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at the disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue all their interests, but is barred to the Arabs...\\\".\",\"Sounds liek what the FED has to do is sign a 50 or more year lease to use certain parts of a space station that is built and designed and such by a commerical company or consortium of companies (such as like Alyeska) for a small amount of rent in return for certain incentives and such..

Now, when I buy over the net and pick up the shipping costs, I'll specify that I only pick up the normal UPS charges (as if delivered directly to UPS), as I've been burned by $10 shipping charges for a $2.49 pkg. I will never use a mailing service unless I don't have the right box and the buyer needs whatever IMMEDIATELY. I'll also tell the person, if they agreed to pick up shipping, what is going on.  Other things to watch out for/consider:   The rates are $5 to $30 higher than UPS direct.   For a non-UPS (truck) package, they quoted a rate  of $85. Fed Ex economy air was only $85 for the  same weight! RPS (a trucking package company, in many  cities) only wanted $18. Guess who got it. The Mailbox  operator told me I was not telling the truth about  competitors' rates, said RPS was unreliable (I've used them  before with NO problems), etc. Right.   A COD check goes to the mailing service. Our local  Mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the  remade check. All this for an additional $3.00 over the  UPS COD charge. What a deal.... :-)   For packages over $100, they charge you about double over  what UPS charges them for insurance. I've never had  a claim, but other netters (is Ralph Seguin out there?)  have told horror stories about them...   All package traces have to be done through Mailbox by  Mailbox.   Our local Mailbox operator told me I was lying when I  asked him why their rates were stratospheric compared  to direct UPS. Does he ever check? Probably not...   Their UPS ground rates come close to Fed Ex's economy  air rate, and Fed Ex will pick up!   UPS will pick up for a $5 charge in most areas!   --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin   Phone: (205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking    (205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

I never, ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way play.  In my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the other hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get 90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.  (By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.

I, for one, : would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.   Hear hear! I completely agree that we need to work quickly to establish alternatives to the government's Clinton Clipper. As Brad Templeton and others have noted, once the Clipper becomes ensconced in enough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the *legal* standard, and it will become the \\\"market* standard as well. (There is a lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is mandated, about whether non-escrow alternatives will be allowed, etc.)  (There are also unclear issues about how hard, or how illegal, it will be to make \\\"workalikes\\\" which meet the standard but which generate phony or untappable keys...I'm sure the next several weeks will see these issues thrashed out in this and other groups.)  Meanwhile, I'd be interested to hear RSA Data Security's reaction. Often criticized in this group for their licensing policies (the usual complaints about MailSafe costing too much, at $125 or so, and the general issue of software patents...), we may find that *allying* ourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do. What's a mere licensing fee when our liberty may be at stake? (If everyone who wanted true security paid, say, $100 for a lifetime use of all of RSA's patents--which expire in the period 1998-2002, or so--then RSA would make tons of money and be happy, I'm sure. A small price to pay. For those to whom $100 sounds like too much, I'm sure the actual terms could be different, spread out over several years, whatever. To me, it's a small price to pay.)  Strong crypto means strong privacy. Escrowing keys, sending copies of keys to large databases, and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces, all done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms, is *NOT* strong crypto!  Whatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of patenting number theory applications, this minor issue pales in comparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal (note that I said \\\"potential\\\"...we'll presumably learn more in the coming months).  The RSA algorithms are at least public, have been analyzed and attacked for years, and source code is available (to better ensure no deliberate weakenesses or trapdoors).  I know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems using off-the-shelf hardware (like Soundblaster boards for the PC) and CELP-type software. The new generations of PCs, using fast 486s and Pentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption. Combined with Diffie-Hellman key exchange, this should provide an alternative to the Clipper system.  Of course, we don't really know if the Administration proposes to outlaw competing systems. (It seems to me that their goal of tapping terrorists, child pornographers, and Hilary bashers would be thwarted if low-cost alternatives to Clipper proliferated. Not to defend child pornographers or terrorists, but limiting basic freedoms to catch a few criminals is not the American way of doing things. End of soapbox mode.)  I suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had with RSA (and don't look at me....I have both MacPGP *and* a fully legal copy of \\\"MailSafe\\\"!) and instead work with them as quickly as we can.

Sorry about that.  #8 LARRY DEPALMA  Season: 3rd Acquired: '91-92, free agent from Minnesota Grade:  I (C-/D+)  No netter/fan watching the Sharks, including me, knows where DePalma was at the end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights, but he wasn't in San Jose, he wasn't in Kansas City, and his name hasn't appeared on the waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning, DePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good defense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of the way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to Kansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks officials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.  #10 JOHAN GARPENLOV  Season: 3rd Acquired: '91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round   pick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver Grade:  A/A-  After an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the team, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob Gaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in the MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power- play goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite his small size (5' 11\\\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around when necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work on his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will be a major key to the offense next year.  #15 DAVID BRUCE  Season: 5th Acquired: '91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft Grade:  I (?)  After a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and was third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the lineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame, because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his future with the Sharks next season appears clouded.  #18 MARK PEDERSON  Season: 3rd Acquired: '92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud Grade:  I (B)  It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson, after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but after riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the Sharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with 41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by injuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when healthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size (and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a physical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability on defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much, exactly, Pederson can do.  #20 JOHN CARTER  Season: 4th Acquired: '91-92, free agent from Boston Grade:  I (B+/B)  Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard work worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he did look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55 games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about 20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always hussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end, but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress offensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He is very unlikely to be back next season.  #28 JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (B+/B)  I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the 14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating opportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL duty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those 14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training camp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the Sharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season.  #41 MARK BEAUFAIT  Season: 1st Acquired: 2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft Grade:  I (?)  After a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the Sharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the Sharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only NHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9\\\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times, although it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played mostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and Kansas City.  #42 JAROSLAV OTEVREL Season: 1st Acquired: 8th round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade:  I (?)  Like Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally very much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either, although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those 7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his defense is acceptable, he should be ready.  #44 MICHEL PICARD  Season: 1st Acquired: '92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau Grade:  I (B-/C+)  The 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to be close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the Sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for his only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City. He was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although he has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the expansion draft.  #45 DODY WOOD  Season: 1st Acquired: 3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade:  I (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)  I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably no surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although 13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was not particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games, projecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at least another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if nothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11\\\", 181 lbs.) does not give much possibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.\",\": . : . : >I have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here : >using [Procomm Plus for Windows], but the screen seems to have a problem  : >keeping up with the : >modem....he has a 14,400 modem on a 486 50 Mhz machine.  : Tell him he probably needs to upgrade to a faster video card!

Not only will this let us run point to point encrypted speech, it'll let us run speech internationally over the internet if no-one stops us by getting *very* heavy about regulations.

Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol for internet speech *damn fast*, allowing anyone who feels brave to inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our workstations.  Shouldn't be too difficult.  The CELP stuff is standardised, we use tcp/ip streams, and a protocol allowing silences to be used to catch up on any net lag, and also to avoid sending any data during silences (ie it's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each end because any net delays would add up to big voice-lags)  As for me, I'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as I get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone.

THOSE INTREPID ISRAELI SOLDIERS       Israeli soldiers have sexually taunted Arab women in the occupied Gaza Strip   during the three-week-long closure that has sealed Palestinians off from the   Jewish state, Palestinian sources said on Sunday.    The incidents occurred in the town of Khan Younis and involved soldiers of  the Golani Brigade who have been at the centre of house-to-house raids for  Palestinian activists during the closure, which was imposed on the strip and  occupied West Bank.    Five days ago girls at the Al-Khansaa secondary said a group of naked  soldiers taunted them, yelling: ``Come and kiss me.'' When the girls fled,   the soldiers threw empty bottles at them.        On Saturday, a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their  pants when they saw girls from Al-Khansaa walking home from school. Parents   are considering keeping their daughters home from the all-girls school.        The same day, soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth  escaped from them at a boys' secondary school. Deputy Principal Srur   Abu-Jamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls, backed them   against a wall, and put their arms around them.    When teacher Hamdan Abu-Hajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat  him with the butts of their rifles.    On Tuesday, troops stopped a car driven by Abdel Azzim Qdieh, a practising  Moslem, and demanded he kiss his female passenger. Qdieh refused, the   soldiers hit him and the 18-year-old passenger kissed him to stop the   beating.    On Friday, soldiers entered the home of Zamno Abu-Ealyan, 60, blindfolded  him and his wife, put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance. As  the elderly couple danced, the soldiers slipped away. The coupled continued  dancing until their grandson came in and asked what was happening.        The army said it was checking the reports.                   ....................           ISRAELI TROOPS BAR CHRISTIANS FROM JERUSALEM    Israeli troops prevented Christian Arabs from entering Jerusalem on Thursday   to celebrate the traditional mass of the Last Supper.        Two Arab priests from the Greek Orthodox church led some 30 worshippers in  prayer at a checkpoint separating the occupied West Bank from Jerusalem after  soldiers told them only people with army-issued permits could enter.        ``Right now, our brothers are celebrating mass in the Church of the Holy  Sepulchre and we were hoping to be able to join them in prayer,'' said Father  George Makhlouf of the Ramallah Parish.        Israel sealed off the occupied lands two weeks ago after a spate of  Palestinian attacks against Jews. The closure cut off Arabs in the West Bank  and Gaza Strip from Jerusalem, their economic, spiritual and cultural centre.       Father Nicola Akel said Christians did not want to suffer the humiliation  of requesting permits to reach holy sites.        Makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory, allowing Jews free movement  to take part in recent Passover celebrations while restricting Christian  celebrations.        ``Yesterday, we saw the Jews celebrate Passover without any interruption.  But we cannot reach our holiest sites,'' he said.        An Israeli officer interrupted Makhlouf's speech, demanding to see his  identity card before ordering the crowd to leave.                      ...................

I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to be contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions? What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time? This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically stood by the Pope.  It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over authority and discipline.    My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:    Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   don't jointly make such  choice.)  If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority. If I adopt the view that \\\"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\\\", that I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  The Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdiction viewing authority as present in each bishop, and in Ecumenical Councils.  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines  regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of the Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going into the merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree that a split occurred, and don't paly what appear to be semantic games like \\\"He's the Pope, but we don't recognize that what he does is effective...\\\".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \\\"real\\\" traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.    I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.` I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility? Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand. Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome, one way or the other.   It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.    True enough.   One could argue that they are establishing a non-geographic jurisdiction. I don't know if that's even a concept or problem in Catholic circles.

Fortunately, it doesn't itch.  The rash  always comes on the day after the fever breaks and no matter what the illness was:  cold, flu, whatever. It started happening about four years ago after I moved to my current town, although I don't know if that has anything to do with anything.  Severity and persistance of the rash seems to vary with the fever: a severe or long-lasting fever brings a long-lasting rash.  A mild fever seems to bring rashes that go away faster.    Anybody know what might be causing this?  It's no more than an  embarassment, but I'd be curious to know what's going on.  Am I carrying some kind of fever-resistant bug that goes wild when fever knocks out its competition?\",\" Perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then.  To me, an absolute is something that is constant across time, culture, situations, etc.  True in every instance possible.  Do you agree with this definition?  I think you do:   A simple example:  In the New Testament (sorry I don't have a Bible at work, and can't provide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in church.  Now, this is scripture.  By your definition,  this is truth and therefore absolute.    Do women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all  scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and  coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.   Yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare  heads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew  up in.)  Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture  to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.) Can you reconcile this?   I don't claim that there are *no* absolutes.  I think there are very few, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.    But you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute.  How can you determine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can't agree how to interpret the Scripture?    It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based  on your own *interpretation* is absolute.  Do you deny that your own background, education, prejudices, etc. come into play when you read the  Bible, and determine how to interpret a passsage?  Do you deny that  you in fact interpret?\",\" I'm still catching up from Spring Break, but bear with me...    Javy Lopez has proven, over 1400+ AB in the minor leagues, that he is ready to play in the majors. He is *not* being rushed. Players who are clearly too good for AA and play behind stiffs at the major league level are wasting their time, and may actually have a court case against major league management for keeping them, at AAA.   Unless Lopez is *me* defensively (I'm 5'7'', 165 and born to play second base :-)), he belongs in the major leagues.   Valentine isn't saying he should back up. He's saying he should be put in a position to *win* the job in the major leagues, which, IMHO, he would if given the opportunity. (Val, if I'm misinterpreting, please let me know.)    But the players who *are* ready are 1)the best and 2) the ones most likely to benefit from being in the majors. Javy Lopez is not a middle- of-the-road prospect. He's the real thing. NOW.   Again, the most important thing a player can do is hit. Lopez does that miles better than Olson or Berryhill. If his defense is good enough for Greenville, or Richmond, it's good enough for Atlanta. If he really was awful defensively, he would no longer be a catcher. See Sprague, Ed.   Oh, where to start... OK. First of all, solid != good. I want good players. Solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really aren't very good at baseball. Think of it as \\\"TWG\\\" without the caps. It's a losing strategy to say, \\\"We have solid guys, we don't need to improve.\\\" You used it four times in that paragraph, BTW.  Same for experienced. I might add, though, that Greg Olson and Damon Berryhill aren't exactly Carter and Fisk. Olson has played three years, Berryhill five, although 90 and 91 were a wash. The only difference, IMHO, between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast.  \\\"Two big bats.\\\" Hrm. I like Justice, but I find Mr. Gant's trend disturbing. Call it one and a maybe. The Braves' platoon is OK, but neither player has *any* value outside of the platoon. Bream vs. LH and Hunter vs. RH are awful. I'll leave the thirdbase comment alone. Pendleton has wasted too much bandwidth already. If the CF platoon hits .300, I'll retrace Mr. Likhani's midnight run down Forbes, and I live in NY and LA. (Got that, Mike?)  And doesn't Cox call pitches, anyway?   Nope. They're baseball management, possible the most short-sighted  collection of people in the nation. Do you not believe this goes on, Mark? Do you think Frank Thomas needed those three months in AAA in 1990? Or Cal Eldred wasn't *really* better than Ricky Bones last year?   You're mostly polite; make defensible, if flawed cases; have wit and have, in the past, admitted being wrong. That does qualify you on r.s.b. We'll make an SDCN out of you, yet :-) \",\" Yes, this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws. However, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all five schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against muslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do not know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and open hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know that historically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone by the death penalty.  My understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the law of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the Qur'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy.  I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \\\"fasad\\\". This ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.   I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book. However, the charge of \\\"fasad\\\" can encompass a number of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that the condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the \\\"crisis\\\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people, not books.  The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz, presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred.  Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this point that the fatwa on \\\"fasad\\\" was issued.  The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The crime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being played out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.\",\"I am running Windows 3.1, Windows for Work Groups and just loaded Dos 6.

The assertion was made, unequivocally that no Christian ever sufferred for their faith by believing in the Resurrection.  Luke's account suggests otherwise, and in the absence of direct eyewitnesses who can claim that Luke is mistaken, then I suggest that this unequivocal assertion is suspect.    --  John G.

Thus it's not necessary to show that no Christian ever suffered for believing in the Resurrection.  Rather the issue is whether those who witnessed it did.  I do agree that the posting you're responding to shows that there can be liberal as well as conservative dogmatism.\",\"Whatever equipment will work on a mac plus or a mac se will work fine on  a mac portable.

That's the point, after all.   That's because these \\\"peer-reviewed\\\" studies are not addressing the effects of MSG in people, they're looking at animal models. You can't walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects demonstrated in humans.  Note that I wouldn't have any argument with a statement like \\\"noting that animal administration has pro- duced the following [blah, blah], we must be careful about its use in humans.\\\"  This is precisely NOT what you said.   It most certainly is for neurotoxicology.  You know, studies of glutamate involve more than \\\"food science\\\".   So, point us to the studies in humans, please.  I'm familiar with the literature, and I've never seen any which relate at all to Olney's work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons.   Well, actually, they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine; it's a essential amino acid.  They just try to get as little as is healthy without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the blood.   Goodness, I'm not saying that it's good to feed infants a lot of glutamate-supplemented foods.  It's just that this \\\"projected safety margin\\\" is a construct derived from animal models and given that, you can \\\"prove\\\" anything you like.  We're talking prudent policy in infant nutrition here, yet you're misrepresenting it as received wisdom.   You mean \\\"asserting\\\".  You're being intellectually dishonest (or just plain confused), because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other.  Olney's reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants, but that's not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods, nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects (for obvious reasons.)  It says nothing about MSG's contribtion to the phenomenon of the \\\"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\\\".  It says nothing about the frequent inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab.

The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it.  Easter (or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings) is the pagan whore goddess of fertility.  Therefore, your question to me is \\\"what is the objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess?\\\"  When phrased that way I suspect (or at least I would HOPE) that it becomes immeadiately apparent what my objection to \\\"celebrating\\\" her would be.    > It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.         No, you are thinking perhaps of \\\"Ressurection Sunday\\\" I think.  (Though I'm not too crazy about the word \\\"Sunday\\\", but I certainly like this phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.)      For that matter, stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet (The Feast of First Fruits).  Torah commands that this be observed on the day following the Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modern parlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it all over the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sunday following Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblical methods?    > I don't recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate  > the resurrection, but it is the sole and only reason that  > we are Christians--how could we not celebrate it?         So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whore goddess)?  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.  Just keep that whore out of the discussion.    > If it is only the name which is a problem, I suggest that if  > we are too concerned about etymology, there are a lot of  > words we are going to have to drop.

What happened to \\\"there is  > neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for  > all are one in Christ Jesus\\\"?         Read the letter to Philemon.  Now tell me, was Philemon's \\\"slave\\\" returned to him?  Were there different rules upon the slave than upon Philemon?  How about male and female?  Are there different \\\"rules\\\" that apply to them as well?  Or if there is no more \\\"male and female\\\" can Adam and Steve get married to each other in your congregation?  Yes, there are differences in form and function.  But the way we come to Salvation in Messiah remains the same no matter what our position in life.   ---------------------------------------  [I am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion, as it seems repetitive, but this particular point is one that I believe is new -- the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name.  I'd like to suggest that people think very carefully about this argument.  Words often change their meaning over time.  The days of the week are of course originally based on pagan gods.  Some Christians prefer to refer to \\\"first day\\\", \\\"second day\\\", etc.  However the majority of Christians have not been persuaded.  The question seems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows as the derivation of a word, if what people mean by it and think when they use it is different.  Indeed I'd like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be dangerous.  Suppose people in general use Easter to mean the celebration of Christ's resurrection.  Postings trying to convince them that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run the risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose. They are doing their best to *create* a linkage in people's minds between their celebration and the pagan goddess.  It's not clear that this is a healthy thing.\",\"I've got a probelm with printing envelops on my deskjet 550C from Word for Windows.

According to my always questionable newspaper, there's a silver dollar being minted in Canada, the back of which commemorates the anniversary of the Stanley Cup.  Now, I know full well what coins are used every day in Canada.  I can easily fish a few out of my pocket change right now, in fact.  My question is, since the loon is the only dollar coin that I know is legal tender, is this just a commemorative coin with no monetary exchange value, or what?  Is it the sort of thing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet, with no chance of it being circulated?  If it is an uncirculated coin, what's the current cost and what's its potential value?  Just curious.  If no one knows, I'll take this to soc.culture.canada and rec.collecting (or whatever it is).  Thanks again \",\" No.  No.  NOOO!!!  The ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if you're grounded in some other way at the same time.    The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly  measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.    They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere, repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things like sub-panels.)  What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact, depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.  There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and news.answers.

Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer screwed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question. Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16\\u00b5sec occur. This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some devices can \\\"hiccup\\\" in the middle of blocks.  If this happens in the middle of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte depending on which direction the tranfer was going.  In anycase the SCSI Manager will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because it is out of sync.  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't pay attention to the errors coming back.  Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but rather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager.  The problem occurs when the processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte hasn't been clocked yet.  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus error handler and doesn't crash the machine...\",\"My comments about the Feingold Diet have no relevance to your daughter's purported FrostedFlakes-related seizures.

(Sorry for length).  To increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed from 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively. This is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some aluminum foil down to work on.  1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case.  2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables,   spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out.  3. Remove the flopy drive.  4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting   the supply straight up and out.  5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom   side of the fan and lifting straight up and out.  6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and   right side of the board and sliding the board forward then   lifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the   board must be removed first)  7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules).   This is not easy even for a skilled solderer.  8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins   by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.  9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder    them in.  10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.  11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and    the other large chip just to the right of the processor and   figure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made a   simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole   in the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using   insulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat   sync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.   12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.    For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.  ---------------------------------   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE     Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government      agencies to listen in on phone conversations?  A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?\",\":  : Of course, penalties will have to be changed: :  : Roughing: Chauvanistic Males Being Aggressive : Slashing: Chauvanistic Males Venting Frustration : Fighting: Proof That Males Cannot Cope With Their Feelings :   NO NO NO! since all the penalties fall into three classes, there should only be three penalties:  1. Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your    body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.  2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the    current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you    are thrown out of the game, and fined.  3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot    is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.  Besides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties in a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one, until the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured.  This works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most exciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better. Next, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can take a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network announcers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and Marv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before the PA announcer says it.  Oh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play cannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network can sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told them who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a  chance of pronouncing his name right.  Seriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week, for the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting contests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their  routines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods either. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The game is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a 10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.  The reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in commercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening. On TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch it on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then it truly is a sad day.

I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it. Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am very concerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in protection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a difference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go somewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket) you can just detach and stow the pants.   One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for many women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (and petite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better.

The documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, are among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the Holocaust is a myth, archivists say.  \\\"The notes give them their authenticity,\\\" said Robert Wolfe, a supervisory archivist for captured German records.  \\\"He was supposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his own rules.\\\"  The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.  Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than 100 German secret police generals.  \\\"I also want to talk to you, quite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly. I mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish race.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been written and is never to be written.\\\"  [Emphasis mine--rje]  The German word Himmler uses that is translated as \\\"extermination\\\" is *Ausrottung*.  Wolfe said a more precise translation would be \\\"extirpation\\\" or \\\"tearing up by the roots.\\\"  In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism, \\\"Judenevakuierung\\\" or \\\"evacuation of the Jews.\\\"  But archives officials said \\\"extermination\\\" is the word he actually spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.  Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's \\\"final solution of the Jewish question,\\\" committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.  The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum here on April 26.

If you were to buy a 1304, would it be possible to switch back and forth between Apple 640x480 and Apple 832x624 without restarting the Mac?  Is this strictly a hardware startup function, or can software intervene, or does the Mac hardware occasionally probe the cable setting and switch automatically?

I won't start panicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, but I'm a little anxious.  (No doubt it won't be long before someone posts explaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and long-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to subvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.)  My feeling is that the administration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and RSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they'll never be used by a group much wider than us computer geeks.  The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:  1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just     now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time.  2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able     to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I     find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy     for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the     administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for     all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made     widely available.)

Does anyone know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.  The main thing I just don't get is whether this chip implements symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know?  I'm guessing symmetric, but they don't get very clear about it.  If it is symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level encryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate a per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted third party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session key?)  If it's asymmetric, what about PKP's patents, which they claim cover all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?

And in the NHL, there exist these things called \\\"ties\\\".  A tie occurs when a game ends with the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie.  There also exits these things called \\\"wins\\\".  A win is when one team has a higher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other at a time, so I can say \\\"the opponent\\\".)  A team gets two points for a win.  So, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10 ties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The first team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86 points.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number of wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That's amazing.  So, Rex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then that's what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the tiebreaker and therefore have the \\\"better\\\" record, even though both teams had the same number of points.

To extend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one (though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of training.  That makes firearms much better, in our eyes.   Excellent point.  Perhaps you aren't so naive after all?   Taken into consideration in what respect?  Though quite wrong, let's make it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has been taken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault, assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted murder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.   In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I'm curious, though, were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or were they aquired by other means?  Any requirements other than just registering the shotgun?   \\\"Come on down to honest Erik's Used Swords!

The time scale and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good. In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal liberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd hazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture we have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population.

I believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it, and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part in the much larger political agenda of President Clinton. I would even  suggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the context of his political agenda. It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda,  as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. Further proof might be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requests for sufficient fire power.   Important dates:  Feb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban. Feb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked.      On Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon ban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senate in N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to have an Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons stated agenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or some group with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially at the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent  on \\\"Street Stories\\\" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to \\\"get  ready fast\\\", as \\\"they know we are coming\\\". I believe this attack continued,  even tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top  down.

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32 alternative health therapies.]    ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the   1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate'   their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object   was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its   surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner   structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found   too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead   and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones   were subject to changes.  The object's life activity was also visible in   highly variable colour patterns.    High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in   the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up   seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at   Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and   others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.    Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's   fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on   healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers   but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and   spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose   diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that   in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person   isn't actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to   foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.    But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is   the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from   which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the   leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely   important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see'   the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing   about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern   can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would   vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid   contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than   the actual object itself.

Many paranormal   movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for   instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will   emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and   hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that   the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian   photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.   Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings   in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The   variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on   the surface of the body and not to mysterious \\\"auras\\\" or even   necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless,   television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous   parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of   the unknown. \",\" This list is published every week in Baseball Weekly. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Brian Curran                 Mead Data Central              brian@meaddata.com \",\"  And yet, Jayne,  as we read the Gospels and in particular the topics that Jesus himself spoke on, Hell figures in a large % of the time -certainly more than heaven itself.  Paul, as we learn in I Thess, taught new believers and new churches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation.  Rev, chapter 20:11-15 is very specific and cannot be allegorized.  I think the word \\\"throne\\\" is used 45 times in Rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the assignment of the severity of judgement, for in John 3 we read that they are already judged.  Rom 3 speaks that every mouth will be shut.  There is no recourse, excuse or defense.  Yes I agree with you.  Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to extremes before stopping at \\\"moderation.\\\"  I think we have seen the extreme of the \\\"hell fire & brimstone\\\" preacher, but also we have seen the other extreme where hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones sensibilities.  I forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries, but I remember him telling a story.  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the point of telling him that he didn't believe in Satan or hell.  He believed everybody was going to heaven.  It was at this point that the man was asked to pray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the man wouldn't do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they don't believe in hell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn't exist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn't exist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.  And yet, they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there.  I'd use a different illustration however.  I have to include myself in it.  When I watch, say a Basketball (go Bulls!) game, and I see a blatant foul that isn't called, oi vey!.  What's with that ref that he didn't make that call.  It's unfair.  And just so in life, righteousness demands payment.  As the surgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away, so God cuts off that which is still of the old creation.  We must preach the Gospel in all its richness which includes the fact that if you reject The Way and The Truth and The Life, then broad is the way to distruction.

But apart from that little  conundrum...  It would seem that a society with a \\\"failed\\\" government would be an ideal setting for libertarian ideals to be implemented.  Now why do you suppose that never seems to occur?...  I wouldn't call it \\\"vague.\\\"  I'd call it elastic.  All \\\"regulation\\\" is  not necessarily the same.  By opposing all government regulation, some  libertarians treat every system from a command economy to those that regulate relatively free markets as identical.

Scientists are empircists, not theologians.   So do scientists, and long before you did.  Clearly you have a deep and  fundamental misunderstanding of science.   Absolutely and utterly false (except for some were AMHs). Lucy (Australopithecus afarensis, ca. 3 to 3.25 mya) is 40% complete, and about 80% taking into  consideration bilateral symmetry.  Lucy walked upright and bipedally, just  like humans, and the two share a remarkably similar dental pattern.  Her cranial morphology is unlike humans or modern apes.  There are hundreds of  other specimens of this and other species, of which only some are *partially*  reconstructed.  They exist Bill.  You can touch them, feel them, hold them.   But forget hominids.  The earth, the universe, the cultural record all look and  test out as ancient indeed.  They are not reconstructions.  Has God has tricked us here too?  It won't go away, Bill.      So *you* and other fundamentalists say.  What about the billions who don't  say so?  Beware of people who say they have the truth, Bill, and reconsider each time you think you do.   That was not your point, Bill.  Your point above was God *has* the power ....

Surprise surprise, different people react differently to different things. One slightly off the subject case in point. My brother got stung by a bee. I know he is allergic to bee stings, but that his reaction is severe localized swelling, not anaphylactic shock. I could not convince the doctors of that, however, because that's not written in their little rule book.  I would not be surprised in the least to find out the SOME people have bad reactions to MSG, including headaches, stomachaches and even vomiting. Not that the stuff is BAD or POISON and needs to be banned, but people need to be aware that it can have a bad effect on SOME people.

When xlock +nolock is running, and I am working remotely or in batch (at) mode, the runtime of my programs (as timed by using clock() in the code itself) is ~25% slower than if xlock is NOT running.  No other processes seem to affect my runtimes, yet this is very consistent!  Any explanations, real or imagined :)\",\" Snort.  Ah, there go my sinuses again.   Oh, wow.  A classic textbook.  Hey, they laughed at Einstein, too!   Yeah, I'll bet.  Tomorrow, the world.  Listen, uncontrolled studies like this are worthless.   I'm sure you are.  You sound like the typical hysteric/hypochondriac who responds to \\\"miracle cures.\\\"   Yeah, \\\"it makes sense to me\\\", so of course it should be taken seriously. Snort.   Yeah, \\\"it sounds reasonable to me\\\".   Oh, really?  _What_ tests?  Immune-compromised, my ass. More like credulous malingerer.  This is a psychiatric syndrome.   You know, it's a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused in this way.  It's ridiculously expensive, and potentially toxic. The trouble is that it isn't toxic enough, so it gets abused by quacks.   The only good thing about nystatin is that it's (relatively) cheap and when taken orally, non-toxic.  But oral nystatin is without any systemic effect, so unless it were given IV, it would be without any effect on your sinuses.  I wish these quacks would first use IV nystatin or amphotericin B on people like you.  That would solve the \\\"yeast\\\" problem once and for all.

HG makes the v-pilot jackets, mine is a very similar style made by Just Leather in San Jose. I bought one of the last two they ever made.  Finding decent womens motorcycling gear is not easy.  There is a lot of stuff out there that's fringed everywhere, made of fashion leather, made to fit men, etc.  I don't know of a shop in your area.  There are some women rider friendly places in the San Francisco/San Jose area, but I don't recommend buying clothing mail order.  Too hard to tell if it'll fit.  Bates custom makes leathers.  You might want to call them (they're in L.A.) and get a cost estimate for the type of jacket your wife is interested in.  Large manufacturers like BMW and H.G. sell women's lines of clothing of decent quality, but fit is iffy.  A while ago, Noemi and Lisa Sieverts were talking about starting a business doing just this sort of thing.  Don't know what they finally decided.  Beth\",\"  Awww, right, you want all the home mechanics lined up against a wall and shot eh?  Bull Pucky you chicken! Read the service manual and get your head out of the sand! Certainly there are tools for the job that are cheaper than an alignment rack, that do the job as competently (albeit, not as swiftly), if not more accurate, due to the natural pride an owner/mechanic places on his work. You can do an `acceptable' job of aligning a car using simple tools and some imaginative work that would *never* have the effect of endangering anyones life. The worst that happens is that your tires wear oddly (well, you could have the wheels aiming TOTALLY pigeon toed and not be able to steer the car, raise your hands those that think their vision is so poor that they would screw up this badly!)  I bet you are one of those people that feels that honing a cylinder wall with sand paper will kill millions of people. It aint magic. Go take the certification course, and look at the people that have never learned to add in their whole life that are taking the certification!  BTW, I am disgusted at the Colt (and some of the other Chrysler offerings) because they go out of alignment if you sneaze at them. My '84 Chrysler Laser (Similar to the Daytona, a reskinned Colt) needed a realignment every 3 months ... Bolt a good grade 12' 2x4 to each wheel, using a carefully welded spacer jig. Measure toe in, adjust to manufacturer specs. Camber a bit more difficult to adjust and measure ... I used a micrometer to measure the space between the rim and a funky bent up pipe that could be placed on upper and lower portions of the rim on the inside of wheel (hard to explain). This same tool could be used instead of the 2x4s.  I had made these tools up *right* after the last alignment done professionally so I had a reference that the original poster might not ...\",\"MIGHTY ONES GET MIGHTIER:  TPS, the Finnish Champions 1992/3, are getting still stronger!  I just heard some news, according to which TPS has acquired the next Finnish hockey superstar(??) Jere Lehtinen from Kiekko-Espoo!  There are also some rumours about Erik Kakko (Reipas) and Marko Jantunen (KalPa) being traded to TPS. Both of this players are currently on the Finnish olympic team. I think that Jantunen is drafted to the NHL, too.  BTW. Is Juha Yl|nen (centre, HPK) drafted by the Jets?? During last year he has reached the top level among Finnish centres. He had very good playoff games against TPS!    Hannu\",\" In case anyone missed it, I'm reposting this and I'm also selling some other stuff.     I've sold one, but I still have 2 left for sale. I also realize that $45 is alot of money, especially if you don't normally collect cards. So if enough people are interested, I'll break up the set into team sets. I'm not sure how much for each. It would be nice to just sell them for $3 each, but then the people who get the Whalers and Devils (Note, I'm not bagging on these teams its just that they don't have alot of good rookie cards in this set) would be subsidizing the people who want Chicago or Pittsburgh. So I'll have to make it varialble pricing. But most of them should be about $2 or $3 dollars.       Ok someone asked for this one, but he's from Canada, if he can get me the be the alternate.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design     team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.       ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into     Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20     Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas     scintillation proportional counters.       CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint     NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian     system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini     is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.     After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA     trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon     arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an     orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens     Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of     Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours     while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the     surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter     continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and     targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the     mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,     rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's     satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.      One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain     down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to     peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the     surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.      The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the     first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of     Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan     atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan     Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true     nature of Saturn's rings.

Has made     multiple lunar flybys. Released Hagoromo, a smaller satellite,     into lunar orbit. This mission made Japan the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon.       MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire     surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity     map.       MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.     Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in     transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for     one martian year (687 days).       TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched     8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the     TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global     observations of the sea level for several years, substantially     increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also     will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.       ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over     its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields     experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for     various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.      Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of     the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from     that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist     manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted     about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole     in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its     perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft     that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!      While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and     radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see     *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical     detail, see the many articles in the same issue.

P.Vasilion, kb2nmv SUNY @ BUFFALO <<STD.DISCLAIMERS>>\",\"I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've  transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Note for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a single staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3 scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is  currently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale  experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.  On April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled  \\\"Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions\\\" here at the University of Illinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is not directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with  them recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used  the DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the details of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope they aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.  The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The main restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I did not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters and 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in  mid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson showed the following plot of acceleration vs time:                   ______ 3 G         /|   /      |            / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly            /  | /        |    good.  The big difference is that the lines 2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are         /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as        /                |          the graph wasn't up for very long. 1 G   /                 |                         |                         | 0 G                     |               ^          ^            ~100 sec    ~400 sec   As mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below 3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the accelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are  throtled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in  accelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines bring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut out entirely.  The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed for an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of air drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to  that desired.  Questions from the audience:  (paraphrased)  Q:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than     all at once?  A:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.  Q:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?  A:  Can't tell us.  \\\"Read Aviation Leak.\\\"  He also apparently had a good      propulsion example, but was told not to use it.    My question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting national security or MD protecting their own interests?  The second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch up maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and  the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs of heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar, and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate. The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have about 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about  60 degrees south latitude.  I would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about that aspect of the flight profile. \",\"Don A.B.

But once you start talking about behaviour, then someone's suscept- ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you  are - I assume - worried about.  And in that area, what you care about is whether someone is sceptical, critical and autonomous on the one hand, or gullible, excitable and easily led on the other.  I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates that a person is easily led.

SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}  Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1  so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too.

One of our German friends here (Robert?) told me their forwards were all Canadian-Germans. Perhaps somebody can sort this out for us?    OK, \\\"this ain't North America\\\" and so on, but I still doubt that _any_ city having a pop. of 500,000 and below could support an NHL team. Of course, Switzerland probably should be judged as one large city because of small distances between cities but still.    Dusseldorf? YES, although the arena is an anachronism (an OPEN wall behind one of the goals - essentially an outdoor arena!). Cologne's arena only seats about 7,000-8,000, Berlin is about 6,000 and no new facility will be built unless their Olympic bid is successful. Munich does have an arena.    Malmo is big enough, but they also need a new arena...the current one has  5,000 seats I think.   If we're talking about the NHL, even Helsinki would struggle to make it work. Turku (despite an excellent arena) and Tampere are nowhere near big enough for major league hockey.   ...Rome and the south are out of the question; this could as well be Africa to hockey fans. Romans were given the chance to host some WC'94 games but showed no interest whatsoever. All teams in the Italian league come from Milan and the smaller cities in the north.   Paris had their own \\\"Volans Francais\\\"(sp) pro team a couple of years ago. I believe they even made it to the European Club Championship finals  tournament one year, but eventually folded due to lower-than-hoped-for  attendances. The remaining cities seem to be too small to support a minor  sport like hockey.   The easter cities lack the money and infrastructure to support pro hockey.   Perhaps . . . Most European teams will have to be like the Tampa Bay Lightning anyway; playing in a small 10,000 seat arena, backed by Japanese money, run by  enthusiasts (Phil Esposito), heavy marketing, fans that have difficulty telling what \\\"icing\\\" means... London has been mentioned, Sheffield and Birmingham also have large arenas and a new mega-facility (16,000 seats!) might be built in Bristol in a couple of years.   No facilities to speak of; their biggest arena (in Eindhoven) seats 2,500  fans for hockey. \",\"It has been known for quite a while that the earth is actually more pear shaped than globular/spherical.

Then as you understand it, what is it?   Yes.  I agree with that.  But what does that have to do with Jesus? Punishment you say?  Jesus did not regard his death as punishment.    Good.  I wouldn't either--not the way you understand it.     Ask Jesus himself.  He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for a persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your question.  Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason why Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with his punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that we would \\\"stop doubting and believe\\\" (John 21:27).  The fact that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise from the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it. Without this obvious point, I would have no hope and my faith would be vanity.  Why did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus says why in John 15:18-25.

But  most people aren't aware that in 1939 Hitler said that he would pattern his elimination of the Jews based upon what the Armenians did to Turkish people in 1914.        'After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?'       (Adolf Hitler, August 22, 1939: Ruth W. Rosenbaum (Durusoy),            \\\"The Turkish Holocaust - Turk Soykirimi\\\", p. 213.)   I refer to the Turks and Kurds as history's forgotten people. It does not serve our society well when most people are totally unaware of what happened in 1914 where a vicious society, run by fascist Armenians, decided to simply use the phoniest of pretexts as an excuse, for wiping  out a peace-loving, industrious, and very intelligent and productive  ethnic group. What we have is a demand from the fascist government of x-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our people. And the only way we can do that is if we can catch hold of and  not lose sight of the historical precedence in this very century. We  cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to  keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because  of their religion or their race. Which means that I support the claims  of the Turks and Kurds to return to their lands in x-Soviet Armenia,  to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

It is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normal civlized life. They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967 without civil and political rights.   It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country, Palestine. Gaza is not a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreign country for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians are concerned and as far as common sense has it.   It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens and the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists will begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same rights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.  Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel is entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should be entitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel to enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master and slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.  To close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistence and means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a crime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss  to which Israeli society has degraded.   I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain why Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return and live there ? Would they be allowed to, if they converted to Judaism ? Is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their religion or ethnic origin ? Please give an honest answer.\",\"I have read that there will be some concrete proposals concerning creation of a \\\"palestinian police force\\\" during the talk's next stage.

Assuming you're serious, I guess you'd be surprised to hear that us GUYS don't think so. I would guess that a tiny fraction of 1% of the folks reading your post agree with it. I kind of doubt that even you agree with it.  I'm not going to go through your points one at a time, because,  after all, not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball.  I'm only replying to this because you brought up Pam Postema, the AAA umpire who sued (is suing?) baseball on the grounds of sex discrimination because she wasn't promoted to the majors.   I've never seen her ump a game. I have no first hand experience with her ability as an umpire.  But I have seen her on talk shows. And her point seems to be that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. It seems to me that she is missing the point and if that's how she sees the role of umpires in the game, well I wouldn't promote her either.  The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners safe or out; hell, Joe Lundy could do that. Their primary function is to maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the players from trying to kill each other.   Umpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies most of us, both men and women. And if Ms. Postema thinks that she deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of the rulebook, then I think that disqualifies her as well. Umpires need to command the game; command of the rulebook is secondary.   \",\"     Oh, then, I guess that shooting THOSE kind of babies is all right.

Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of 17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff-bound Blues.  The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3. With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit playing.  They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired.  ``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,\\\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.  If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues' disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry's anger.  ``It wasn't pretty at the end,\\\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but it did.\\\"  Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end. Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium.  The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points, their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay, which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.  The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.  ``It's a shame we let down,\\\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others. ``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\\\"  Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. ``We won, and that's all that matters,\\\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3 for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\\\"  Some players didn't have a problem.  ``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,\\\" said Rich Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.  ``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\\\"  Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow, he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.  ``I didn't know it was final,\\\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs, and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end.\\\"  The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.  ``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,\\\" Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.\\\"  If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.  Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then, Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.  With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.  Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.  Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the  rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend.  Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.  ``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\\\" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and I know he was watching. I know he's happy.\\\"  Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo at 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds later, making it 5-1.  Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.  Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third period.  The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the winner. ``We were in there,\\\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\\\"\",\" I've noticed some of you mentioning owning a Quadra 800 8/230 with CD300 and 1meg of VRAM.

The idea is commercialized in at least one product, the Private Eye.  That's a small cube-shaped device that the user straps around the head similar to a sweat band.  There is a boom that comes from the side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned in front of the user's eye.  The Private Eye we had here for evaluation was Hercules-MDA compatible.  The innards are a row (~400 LEDs) that are swept up and down by a galvonometer-like movement.  The result is that the sweeping LED bar forms a fused raster.  There is a virtual image projected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse with the background.  I didn't like the device very much.  I found it easiest to use if I looked at a blank white wall.  I had problems with focus tracking if I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key. The unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which I found annoying.  Some people didn't seem to mind the buzz.  Properly used, however, the image clarity was quite crisp.  I don't know if the company has taken the technology any further in the last year or two, but it did seem to have promise.  \",\"   Ah, so you finally found a use for that super slo-mo and frame advance other than scrutinizing \\\"Sorority Babes in Heat\\\". Congrats!      Trust me, you'd have a helluva time manipulating them. Besides, if you converted the film to video you'd have all kinds of artifacts because of the difference in frame rate (unless you're an expert at doing 3/2 pulldown for a laserdisc company or something).      Hey, no fair! What about 'Fettucine' Alfredo Griffin? The guy practically has to pivot the bat around along with his body.      Daulton doesn't strike me as all that strange. He's a little bit quiet at  the plate but, like Franco, gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level plane. The first time I watched Julio Franco, I didn't think *anyone* could hit like that. Now I marvel at how easy he makes it look; every time he makes contact, it's *solid*. He's got good power to all fields and rarely is he caught not ready for a pitch.     I wonder if Phil Plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to practice his swing while 'on the throne'? :-) Sure looks like it :-)     How 'bout one to add to your list: Travis Fryman? The guy plants his front foot and seems to swing *across* his body. He generates a lot of power, but I keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot out of his hips.      Well, they're already spoken for (by several people), but ..     I'd add Robbie Alomar's name to the list, among others. I really like Dean Palmer's swing, for some twisted reason, as well as Pedro Munoz's swing.      A thought about May: It looks like they've taught him to turn on the ball. IMHO, he's going to fall in love with his newfound power and start pulling off the ball to the point that he's going to see *lots* of sinkers/sliders low and away. Unless he adjusts quickly and starts rifling doubles to left  and left-center, IMHO you're going to see a good number of weak grounders to  the right side of the infield in the next month.  \",\" I had this problem as well - It had to do with the CG6 graphics card that comes with the IPX.

But unfortunely the Yards (a definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots. Ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost gone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for most of the year like '89).   On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.  Fernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching staff looks pretty good.

In addition, I wanted to get one that I could access via AppleTalk, so that eliminated the new line of inexpensive  printers from Apple.  The print quality is good to excellent based on what  font you're using and what paper you use.  I'm still experimenting with  different papers, but a medium grade laser printer paper seems to work fine.  Printing envelopes, transpariencies, letter head, or other single feed jobs is very easy.  There is an adjustable, automatic centering, guide on top of the sheet feeder which aligns the paper properly (and doesn't feed a sheet from the sheet feeder, as some do).
