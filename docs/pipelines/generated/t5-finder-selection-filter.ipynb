In a nutshell the problem is that I lose the first 0.625 inches of information from my left margin, be it white space or TrueType font output, and margins are not preserved on subsequent pages past the first.  WordPerfect had a workaround consisting of using the \\\"Default\\\" location for the printers instead of \\\"Tractor\\\" or \\\"Manual\\\".  They have also filed this as a bug and are continuing to investigate it.  MS Write, of course, has no problem with these printer drivers, proving that Microsoft knows something the rest of us don't!  Are you surprised?  I'm not.  Publish It!/WIN is still investigating this problem, and while I was consider- my options (rejecting the one about buying an $800 DTP package, for *surely* they wouldn't have this problem, right?) I stumbled onto a global workaround.

Many thanks,     ---Mark\",\"  Anyone care to speculate on this? I'll let the rest of the net judge this on its own merits. Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished  of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only  the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian  Armenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of  Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines  genocide as acting with a     'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a     national, ethnic, racial or religious group.'   History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate  the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the  Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including  U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy  as a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of  the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the  extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor  those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians.   The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established, beyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people during the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian  territories.  The Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed. The massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian  Government.  The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were Dro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri, Karakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.

A very small part   of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the  cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering  from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived  in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.

The SR-71, and teh X-15  both highly ambitious  aero-space projects were done on very narrow engineering budgets.   Partly because they didn't spend much on paper  pushing.   There is some company in missouri  trying to get funding to build light commercial transporters  on a low cost basis, mostly by reducing FAA  certification costs.\",\"Excuse me to every one. I am an Amiga owner and tired to have the same graphic modes. So I saw on nn there was a little bridgeboard that made the Amiga's PC slots communicate with the stanndard Amiga's slot. The building mother house of this little gadget assure me that using this thing I can use all the pc boards included the SVGA cards. I am interested in computer graphics and I do not know many things about pc in general. So, what is the best (ISA slot) card on the market ?

You can set up different config.sys and autoexec.bat commands for each user, and they just have to select their menu option on bootup.  Then you can have the autoexec.bat copy the win.ini and system.ini files and change directories for them.  When they exit windows, it can copy back generic .ini files if you want.  This is the only way I can think of.  There may be some programs somewhere that allow you to do this better, though using DOS 6 allows each person to have a custom config.sys and autoexec.bat.\",\" Dean, there's an old engineering saying concerning inventions and wheels.  Contact #0099, he's done several runs of patches, and there is some patch-making company out there with the artwork already set up and paid for. \",\" True.  At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It seemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war, that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It's like they were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was \\\"nice and clean\\\" (smart missiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead, dying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!   [ discussion about blanket-bombing and A-bombs deleted.]                             ^^^^^^^^^  I should have said here \\\"militarily justified\\\".  It seems from your comments below that you understood this as meaning \\\"morally justified\\\". I apologize.   I have often wondered about this.  I've always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of Truk.  A good, inpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could've been held back for use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.  Yes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately, the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's ulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.   I don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the  circumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the suffering caused by those decisions.    [...]   Actually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US and allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other back-water country, we probably wouldn't intervene.  Not that we don't care, but we can't be the world's policman.  Or if a coup had occured in Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn't have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to Saudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil  interests, caused us to take action.   [...]  I'm not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the war, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep Kuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.  Well, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler would lead their nation to.   They suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much? The world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable, but that's The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.  [...]  Probably because we're not the saviors of the world.  We can't police each and every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or some other places.  Tell me how we could stop them and I'll support it.  I, for one, do not agree with the present US policy of \\\"sucking up to them\\\" as you put it. I agree that it is deplorable.   Are they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in order.)  I'm not an expert on California law, or even US law, but it seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize the system, but let's not have unfounded allegations of racial  prejudice thrown around.   No, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks on the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.   Germans, perhaps.  \\\"Peers\\\" doesn't mean \\\"those who do the same thing\\\", like having murderers judge murderers.  It means \\\"having people from the same station in life\\\", presumably because they are in a better position to understand the defendent's motivation(s).   OK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your* logical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.  The media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing liberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)  BTW, I never used the word \\\"conspiracy\\\".  I don't accept (without *far* more evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.   Hardly.  I didn't say that it's a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people if the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn't say it is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.   I would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering.  I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved. And perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let's say) we now know.  That doesn't mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as being necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it.  But don't assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I don't!  I just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances.   You certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist. I, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.   Wrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply refuse to condemn them for their decision.  One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action; even this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of that, and I am prepared to do so.  I don't believe that you can make the same claim.   And BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being  \\\"so deplorable\\\".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War, precision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted *in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians (proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing in WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some civilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories of \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk. Yes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But  we are expected to swallow that \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of  *civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with  the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!   What hogwash.  If \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi civilians died,  it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to  the Allied bombing.  Regards,\",\"  Too right it does!   The --VERY VERY FIRST-- thing you do is make sure that --ALL-- files on the floppies that you can currently read in the drive, which aren't already on your HD or another floppy (if you have -two- floppy drives) get copied to your HD (and/or to a floppy in your other drive).  If you don't do this before fixing the alignment problem you have kissd those files goodbye.  (Well, you can -try- to re-misalign the drive back to read your floppies, but don't count on be able to do so!)

It is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normal civlized life. They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967 without civil and political rights.   It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country, Palestine. Gaza is not a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreign country for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians are concerned and as far as common sense has it.   It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens and the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists will begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same rights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.  Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel is entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should be entitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel to enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master and slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.  To close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistence and means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a crime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss  to which Israeli society has degraded.   I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain why Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return and live there ? Would they be allowed to, if they converted to Judaism ? Is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their religion or ethnic origin ?

THe best sound conversion program I've ever seen is SoundTool, which is shareware from Germany.

It's GREAT at converting files of all types, including Mac, NExT, Sun, and various PC formats... It's also a great player and editor, with various special effects that put Windows' Sound Recorder to shame.  It requires a driver for various sound cards... The only builtin one is for the pc speaker (and even that sounds pretty good), but if you're just using it to convert things, you can convert them in SoundTool and then play them in Sound Recorder.

However, I think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answers to the simple(?) question:  Which would YOU choose, and why?  Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50.  I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?  Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?  Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost?  I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI HD's SCSI-2?

The magnitude of such accelerations he estimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not be a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published in 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very long-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in fact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of course. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration? Can this be extended to larger accelerations?\",\" KY>To all those who have PASSATs, do you recommend using Super Unleaded or just KY>regular Unleaded Gasoline. I have been using Regular Unleaded.

Overacker writes, responding to Simon:     I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the    net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in    schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside    the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?    Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as    provided for in canon law.  Here's some of the theology involved for the interested.  There is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's \\\"schism\\\"; often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:  - true obedience - false obedience - disobedience - schism  Take the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2 important elements involved here for my purposes:  1) a command 2) the response made to the command  As far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be ILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god Dagon when every other full moon comes around.  As far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do what is commanded, or to COMPLY.  Making a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:  command         response            name ----------------------------------------------------- LEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience ILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience LEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience ILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience  So now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.  Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of the commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to consider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are \\\"obedient\\\" or \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad.  In my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god Dagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!  As far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.  And there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been commanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of course disagreed.  So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the traditional teaching of the Church is.  The problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of American Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You will never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press in this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I get -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the Society of Saint Pius X.)  Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some soundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually some Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand, there is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the Popes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.  In fact, if the situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very least, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing to love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this badly.  Schism... let's move on to schism.  What is it?  Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate command).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it's a superset, so it doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are schismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with the Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.  So what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.  You must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any decent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find: the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command.  Here's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:      ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this     character it must include besides the trangression of the commands     of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.     (from the CE article \\\"Schism\\\")  Is the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear no: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every day.  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.  What all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position is a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and schism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone who finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)  Now, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the Holy Father's motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", you can find out.  It's the definitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically Papal act.  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter that the Pope has possibly never even read.  It's from the Pope himself.  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.  In this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:  1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre constituted a schismatic act.  2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of Tradtion.  Both are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.  As far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting article in a translation of the Italian magazine \\\"Si Si No No\\\".  It all gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then they would truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is this: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power of Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the Pope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite well, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.  The \\\"Si Si No No\\\" article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel, post-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea, episcopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article to a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.  I believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.  The Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me. There's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic theology.  So why does the Pope think this?  As far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here's the passage in question:      The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete     and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does     not take sufficiently into the account the living character of     Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,          comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the         help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into         the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes         about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and         study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.         It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which         they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who         have received, along with their right of succession in the         espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.      But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which     opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the     Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to     remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond     with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ     himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.      (Papal motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", 2 July 1988)  It seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following:  - Vatican Council II has happened. - I am the Pope.  The argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that Archbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them. This is weak, to say the least!  It would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed Archbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II's stand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius IX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to ignore what all these Popes said on the subject?  I don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the SSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.  --------------------------------------------------------------  [Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey \\\"justified disobedience\\\" or even \\\"obeying God rather than man\\\". Calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in Wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.  Similarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope says that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it exists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break, that there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will shortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?  It seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in the process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his powers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It's something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is all in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally it has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope. While they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated. This would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command that you say defines schism.\",\"Hi Steve,  As the author of Multiverse, I feel I had better respond to your mailnote questioning whether anyone had managed to compile this software - the quick answer is yes!

April 23, 1993 (Phone:  202/358-1780)  Kyle Herring Johnson Space Center, Houston (Phone:  713/483-5111)  RELEASE:  93-76  HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS   The December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability for an additional two, if needed.   The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times required using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actual EVA tasks on previous missions.   \\\"Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three is to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the dynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks,\\\" Mission Director Randy Brinkley said. \\\"It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.\\\"   In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the spacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays and the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives during the mission.   \\\"When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through lowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays, WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each spacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate,\\\" said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight Director for the mission.   While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than previous missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.   \\\"We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,\\\" Heflin said.  \\\"In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible to accomplish the mission objectives.\\\"   Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions that include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated simulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone underwater training \\\"runs\\\" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.   Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the mission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight will be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.   Endeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will include spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission. The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.   Also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the experience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and trainers.   Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.   The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that time the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in 1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have become necessary.\",\"                                                            The Israelis    used to arrest and sometimes to kill some of these neutral reporters.

You are correct about 'majority.'  Somewhere between 1 out of three and  one out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent  assault.  The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems like heart attack and stroke.  'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1,000,000 Americans using firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some may have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in  using firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population. (Yes, I know that is a REAL rough estimate.  We're closer to 270 million now,  but many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage if anything is low.)  At any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred  to as 'tiny' minorities, so I don't see how the other part of the group  can be referred to as the 'vast' majority.  A little more work might  support a 'simple' majority of Americans never use, own or display a firearm.  Certainly when you are talking about OWNERSHIP you are wrong.  Nearly half of your fellow citizens own one or more firearms.     Please provide a list of other means that are as effective.  Then you might  convince your local police departments to switch.

So far, Israe  continues to propose that they remain. The Palestinians propose that they  leave. Why should either change their view? It is worth pointing out that  the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a reduction in the Israeli presence. Israel proposes no such reduction.... and in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating. ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Tim:   There seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. The first is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, so there is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in  exchange for pieces of paper, \\\"expectations\\\", \\\"hopes\\\", etc. The second is that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand that these \\\"tangible concessions\\\" be made by Israel **without** it receiving anything **tangible** back.  Given this, the gap between the two stances seems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns for its expected concessions. By \\\"tangible\\\" is meant something that 1) provides Israel with \\\"comparable\\\" protection (from the land it is to  give up), 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine  **will be** accountable and held actively (not just \\\"diplomatically)  responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens  or \\\"visitors\\\").  In essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinian statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israel was assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to**  co-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel  from its territory.  Aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,  how *could* such \\\"guarantees\\\" be instilled? For example,  how could such \\\"guarantees\\\"/\\\"controls\\\" be added to the  Palestinian PISGA proposals?  Israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute it lets go (gives lands back to Arab states, no more \\\"buffer zone\\\", gives full autonomy to Palestinians), ANY and/or ALL of the Arab parties could (and *would*, if not \\\"controlled\\\" somehow) EASILY return to the  traditional anti-Israel position. The question then is HOW to *really* ensure that that will not happen.\",\" It was shafting on the part of the Arab land owners for doing it  without notifying their tenant farmers and for not being responsible  enough to make provisions for them, but rather just leaving them to their fate.  The point is that the land was sold legally, often at prices above its actual value.  It was legal, and good business for the sellers, though it left the Palestinians who worked the land in a poor situation.    I don't know if others share this opinion.  It is mine, and I'm sure there are some who agree and some who don't The way I see it, the fallahin were caught in circumstances  beyond their control, in that since they didn't own the land, they didn't have a say. Of course, now for the sake of the \\\"greater  Arab unity\\\" the Arabs are angry that the land was sold to the Jews (an act that is illegal in Jordan), but when it happened, it was just  business.     The purpose of buying the land was to provide space and jobs for  Jewish immigrants.  In any case, no matter what the purpose,  the sales were legal, so I really don't see any grounds for  contesting them.\",\"S P H E R I C A L   D E S I G N I N G\",\"Michael Bushnell writes;   Which is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your use of the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it said the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that has changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the Nicene - Constantinopolitan did not.  Of course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene Creed (it wasn't there to begin with), but they certainly did from the Athanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.  I might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in ways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East emphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father through the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the Son.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see below)   \\\"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do call God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the root and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the river are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms, but coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must necessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on that account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there are two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is third from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit of the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river, and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray.\\\"  -Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)  and   \\\"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father through the Son\\\"  -Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)  And as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36, Articles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of generation, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession emphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in a more preeminent way.   \\\"For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it from the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the Father alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called unbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of theologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a matter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives to the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit proceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of the Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound mind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each, however, but proceeds from each and both.\\\"  -St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)  So, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at least), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but in proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the procession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the Father through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father, the Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any mention of the Son being necessary.  In any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope St. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St. Damsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose of Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the Fathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic position, which I enunciated above.  As for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I will point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke of the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone \\\"to produce, write, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by the Fathers of Nicea.\\\"  That Creed is a different Creed than that of Constantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of course in that they were condemning the adoption of the Constantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of Nicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious, who had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the Church, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy Spirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan Creed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council Chalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been against explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves approved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations of the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work done by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows that the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed by the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians in Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until many years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was not disputed, I provide more quotes below.   \\\"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to God, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly clear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding from it.\\\"  -St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial Trinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)   \\\"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he is the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone loves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him'; and again it is written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the Holy Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel, that the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,' and that `He shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you.'\\\"  -Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)   \\\"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the appelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to the Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the Father,' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,' and `will receive of mine,' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the Son, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit divine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of the Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like soul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father and of the Son, a third by appelation....  \\\"The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit breathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor is the Spirit created.\\\"  -St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored, 8 and 75 (374 AD)   \\\"Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is it necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him, it is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary to speak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and the Son, His Sources.\\\"  -St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)   Thus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt, Palastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time, all have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine expressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church that they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus who all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is not enough to bring up the \\\"proceeds from the Father\\\" line of the Creed or the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.  But it does not say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son, only that He does proceed from the Father.\",\"   I was wondering if anyone can shed any light on just how it is that these electronic odometers remember the total elapsed mileage?

I have sometimes tried to put myself in the feet of one of Jesus's disciples.  Basically, they gave up a lot --- career, possibly family, and well, a whole bunch, to follow Jesus.  So what is the difference?  It is quite plain.  Jesus was good and David Koresh was not.  The problem is, I think, is that we try to legislate what is good and what is bad in terms of principles.  For instance, there are thousands of  laws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not.  Often, it is hard to bring people to justice, because it is not possible to find a legal way to do it.  If only we could trust judges to be just, then we could tell them to administer justice fairly, and justice would be followed.  But since judges don't always get it right, we have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches of other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect (the justice of man) into something perfect.  But what I hear about the justice system in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true.  There is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation more than the material being presented.  So we might consider  a ranting Christian to be bad, but an eloquent person from another religion to be good.  This goes along with the American desire to protect the Constitution at all costs, even if it allows people to do bad things.   I think that it is the message that is important.  If a man is presenting a false message, even if he is ever ever so mild mannered, then that man is performing a tremendous disservice.  I know that I am rambling here.  I guess that what I am trying to say is that we shouldn't be looking for principles that tell us why the Davidians got it wrong.  It is not wrong to follow and worship a person.  But it is important to choose the right person. It is simple.  Choose Jesus, and you got it right.  Choose anyone else, and you got it wrong.  Why?  Because Jesus is the begotten son of God, and nobody else is.  Jesus was without sin, and nobody else was.\",\"Fellow netters,  I'm in the market for a hand scanner.  However, I don't know anyone who has one.  I have my eye on two choices.  Dexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software Catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.  Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales (according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169 mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.  I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400 dpi) and price ($149).    Basically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the best buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of prices.  Which should I buy?  If you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would recommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range (under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.  Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.\",\"General question: Since the world was discovered to be round, the definition of Saturday is, if not ambiguous, at least arbitrary.

I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, I have other xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning.  In case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles, here's a crude picture:   ====================== Figure 1 ====================================  |  |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+  |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C +  |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+  |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C, but +  |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  +  |    +      window, window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     +  |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+  |  ====================== Figure 1 ====================================  Squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack, with easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really need, since I also insist on having a virtual WM.  The only problem is that the title location is static, that is,  it is configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and time-consuming.  Therefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right } functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click of a button, you can change this:      +---------+     + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+  to this:                     +---------+                    + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+   ===============  Okay.

One way would be to post, in comp.windows.x, a description of this enhancement, together with an explanation of why I think it is a Very Good Thing, and hope that someone reads it. :-)  In case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing, look back up at Figure 1, and picture window A moved over on top of windows B and C; now window A's title hides Window B's title; but when you hit f.squeezecenter, the result is:          +=========+   +---------+   +=========+         + title B +   + title A +   + title C +         +-------------------------------------+         +   this is the body of the window,   +         +   window A, which is on top.        +         +-------------------------------------+   ===================  The rest of this posting explains how to implement it, based on my X11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the full diffs would be too long.  The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the ExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c:  #ifdef SHAPE  case F_SQUEEZELEFT:  { static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT, 0, 0 };   if (DeferExecution (context, func, Scr->SelectCursor))     return TRUE;    tmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze;   SetFrameShape( tmp_win );   break;  }  .... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and  squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ... #endif  ( Of course, you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h   and add     { \\\"f.squeezeleft\\\", FKEYWORD, F_SQUEEZELEFT },      ... and so forth ... to parse.c  In order to use these functions, add something like the following to your .twmrc file:  Button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter   =================  About a year ago, I posted this, but our news was broken and I *think* it didn't get out.  Since then, \\\"blast\\\" has appeared in comp.sources.x, Volume 19, Issue 41; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect, by chiseling away at an mwm-style wide title.

GOD of the Bible has given us humans relativly little about how he   intends to judge mankind. the first test is those who have beleived that Jesus   Christ is the Son of GOD and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to   serve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god,   the bible calls this sin. for those who die before the end of the world/have   already died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche.   God must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world. however   there is no plus and minus system for GOD. he has declared that he can not   tolerate spiritual imperfection, thus he can only based your worthiness to   live with him on the wrong in your life.    Good people, yes even Christians are going to constantly sin before GOD, The   Christian hoever thanks GOD that Christ has given his life for his sin's   penalty. the proscribed punishment for sin is death, just as the proscribed   punishment for robbery is time in jail.

He does not want to condem. the Bible says in John   3:17, that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that   through him it might be saved.\\\" when i realize that i have sinned, and i do   with painful regularity, i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin   against me, i have that right and privlige only because of Christ. as for Jews   they are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come, and   dis come in Jesus of Nazereth.

If a player is on the ice when his team scores a lot of goals and only allows a few goals, he must be doing something right. It is especially useful to compare between teammates- as they play for the same team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equally good players.  It can be adjusted- with varying degrees of success to compare between players on different teams.  I agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics- but how useful are the ones that you suggest??  Total ice time would be very useful- it is a missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before.  Somehow measuring the quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless.  It would be a better stat for evaluating coaching- ie are the players given quality ice time actually their talented ones?  A very good player could be given low amounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who doesn't recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of quality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that thinks he is an effective player.  This stat would be much more flawed than +/- and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent.  +/- is a useful stat.  It is quite useful in evaluating player talent. You are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see that being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed is a very positive thing- and should be evaluated as such.\",\" I think this guy is going to be just a little bit disappointed.

On a typical UPS (well, on ours, anyway), there is NO switchover from AC to DC.

If the power fails, big deal -  the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but  there's something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it  takes a while).  If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter, why not do it all the time?  Then there'd be no switchover to screw things up, and no having to sense the failure fast.

This article will provide the essential information for doing so on standard Unix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups are included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com for a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive mailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can list it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the Usenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)  First of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin, or 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also important that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems like you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you have trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is probably not good enough.  Listserv:  There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which is available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this article, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should probably  look at listserv carefully.  The Alias file:  On a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on whichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:  foo:   bar, baz, bletch   which means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is redistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest possible email list is   my-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address my-favorite-car-request: my-address  this has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that you have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can do the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:  my-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list my-favorite-car-request: my-address  Where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated addresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory, owned by the list admin.  Bounced Mail:  this still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the members of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating. Therefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up is instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup, by the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)   school-request:   welty school-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list school: \\\"|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school\\\" owner-school: school-request owner-school-out: school-request   here's what is going on here:  the owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail coming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point of contact for administrative duties.  school is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses, it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending the email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name; the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the actual list members.  the shell script i use is as follows:  ----------------- #!/bin/sh cd /tmp sed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \\\\         (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          cat -) | \\\\         /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\\\                 -F \\\"The ${1} Mailing List\\\" ${1}-rebroadcast exit 0 -------------------  note that this script does not know the name of the list; the name is passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple lists (i run several out of this site.) the script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming message, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to: 99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request or owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.  For digested lists, there is some digestification software around. Hopefully I'll be able to provide more information in a future version of this posting.  richard welty (welty@balltown.cma.com)\",\" [ a lot of religious opinions and quotations from the Bible and from  many Catholic theologians and Papal Bulls ]  [ which, although introduced with a smiley, was not as funny as it might have been (notable exception: subject headers such as \\\"ONE'S  DICK IS ONE'S INSTRUMENT OF REDEMPTION.\\\" ]  [ and indeed, the posting seemed to be more a vehicle for the religious text than for any \\\"literary/moral analysis\\\" ]  I am surprised and saddened. I would expect this kind of behavior from the Evangelical Born-Again Gospel-Thumping In-Your-Face We're- The-Only-True-Christian Protestants, but I have always thought  that Catholics behaved better than this.  Friend Dennis, I urge you to follow the example of your fellow Catholics, of who I count many dozens as my friends, and practice your faith through good example and decent living and respect for the common humanity of others. Please do not stoop to the level of the E B-A G-T I-Y-F W-T-O-T-C Protestants, who think that the best way to witness is to be strident, intrusive, loud, insulting and overbearingly self-righteous.  The imagery in the Song of Solomon is a little bit dated (get it?  Middle East - date palms - oh, never mind) but apparently acceptable,  on a steaminess level, to be accepted as part of the canon. From this fact I derive that erotica itself is not incompatible with Catholic doctrine.  Is there such a thing as Catholic erotica? Not necessarily a love story between people of that faith, but a love story that is not exploitative, does not seek redemption through penis size, pays proper respect to the dignity of each partner, and is still erotic enough to have a place on a.s.s.  I would submit that the _Darknites_ series of stories qualify, also most of the _Journal Entries_, and _Rings I and II_.  I would guess that your aim is to cut down on the pornography and increase the erotica. I actually agree with you that nearly all of the \\\"I've got an enormous dick, and I shot my wad all over her face\\\" stories are crap. I count them as noise, which makes my take on the signal-to-noise ration much lower than many other people's.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS      Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints     have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on     microfilm.      The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it     is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like     guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB     have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch     from.      By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify     the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean     sheet design.       WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE      Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access     for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an     opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being     \\\"scooped\\\" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently     releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early     in a mission.       RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES      There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to     block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium     thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in     worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental     reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.     Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2     RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather     satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months     with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar     module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which     was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in     the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10     half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].

Hanson, editor; DOE Document No.  DOE/TIC-22800;     Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., April 1980.)       IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER      From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from     the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible     for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted     study, Charles Jackman.      The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was     organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space     Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia     (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space     Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and     Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects     of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.      The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:         Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year    Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year    Shuttle sources:   725,000 kilograms/year      The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are     launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the     total stratospheric chlorine sources.      The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would     be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.      The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and     Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch     schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons     do at the present time.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE      If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a     minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your     breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to     watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your     Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal     experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no     immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do     not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.      Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \\\"the bends\\\", certainly some     [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from     lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,     you're dying. The limits are not really known.

HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED      The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is     a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.     What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank     came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the     astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin     team's medical/forensic report.      The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the     water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks     underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team     examined them, they were sent off to be buried.       USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT      You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit     because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry     enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.      Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of     that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in     the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly     specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it     higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit     spacecraft.      [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]       THE \\\"FACE ON MARS\\\"      There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid     face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:     35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often     published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13     (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).      Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is     artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an     extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the     resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a     smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere     on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't     know the address) to study the Face.      The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution     camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this     question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is     best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or     sci.astro.      V. DiPeitro and G.

I also worship on Saturday to honor the Lord.  Your mention of \\\"[esteeming]  all days alike\\\" IMO has to do with the fast days observed by the Jews.  But  no matter how you interpret that passage, I do accept your worship on Sunday  as being done in honor of the Lord, in contrast with what many of my fellow  SDA believers may believe.  To me, though, the bible overwhelmingly points  to Saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of God's  deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.  To those who would  attempt to point out that my observance of Saturday is being legalistic,  this is simply not the case.  Rather, keeping Saturday allows me a full day  to rest and contemplate God's goodness and grace.    The idea was introduced to me once that the reason Paul wanted the  Corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the first day of the  week was because that was when they received their weekly wages.  Paul  wanted them to lay aside money for the collection as first priority, before  spending their money on other things.  I do not have any proof in front of  me for this though, although it would explain why they would lay aside money  in their homes instead of a meeting.     It would seem to me that you assume that the christians in the NT regularly  worshipped on the first day.  I assume that the christians in the NT  regularly worshipped on the seventh day.

I feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties more than names honouring personages.  And of course, they would not appear nearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time.   Another thing that bothers me is the points system.  Percentages, as used in the other major sports are clearly more informative.  When I look at the NHL standings the first thing I have to do is make a quick calculation to account for games in hand (which is almost always the case).  Some will object to percentages, claiming perhaps, that it is an \\\"Americanization\\\" of the sport but I feel that using percentages is more informative and whether it is \\\"American\\\" or not is irrelevant.

Mark all of the edges in F as \\\"OK\\\",        and add them to a queue (check for duplicates, and especially        inconsistencies - don't let the queue have both (p,q) and (q,p)).      2) remove an edge from the queue, and go to 1).  If a *marked* edge is discovered to be inconsistent, then you lose.  If step 1) finds more than one face sharing a particular edge, then you lose.

Au contraire; he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella.      Which reports are those?      I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play him IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter. Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem.       I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners. Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases.     As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak  defensively if Blauser plays.

I took cafergot, but it didn't help and the pain started although it wasn't as intense as it usually is and about 9pm that night, the pain subsided.  This isn't the first time that I've had a migraine occur after exercise. I'm wondering if anyone else has had the same experience and I wonder what triggers the migraine in this situation (heat buildup? dehydration?). I'm not giving up tennis so is there anything I can do (besides get into  shape and don't play at high noon) to prevent this?

I understand (from an unreliable source) that Canseco was considered expendable by the A's when he refused to accept any coaching about his batting stance.  The A's brain trust came to believe that his back problems were exacerbated, if not caused, by having a wide open stance, closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque (that's a paraphrase of what I remember).  In any event, Canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide his stance, and the A's began to believe that he would either reinjure himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power.     Apparently, you sound like LaRussa.   The A's also objected about this.    Again, I'm just repeating something I heard.  But possibly the cause and effect is the reverse of that.      -- The Beastmaster  \",\"Archive-name: atheism/introduction Alt-atheism-archive-name: introduction Last-modified: 5 April 1993 Version: 1.2  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----                            An Introduction to Atheism                        by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>  This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst I have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some relevant books are listed in a companion article.  To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.  Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism.  So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine being.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it may not.  \\\"What is atheism?\\\"  Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is often referred to as the \\\"weak atheist\\\" position, and the latter as \\\"strong atheism\\\".  It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \\\"Weak atheism\\\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \\\"Strong atheism\\\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \\\"strong atheists\\\".  Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making flat-out denials.  \\\"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?\\\"  Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not.  Which brings us to agnosticism.  \\\"What is agnosticism then?\\\"  The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed (\\\"strong\\\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable.  Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether God exists.  Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people use agnosticism to mean \\\"weak atheism\\\", and use the word \\\"atheism\\\" only when referring to \\\"strong atheism\\\".  Beware also that because the word \\\"atheist\\\" has so many shades of meaning, it is very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for sure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe.  \\\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\\\"  There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.  Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that such a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they see no evidence that God exists.  \\\"But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\\\"  There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects obeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly well-defined is a matter for debate.  However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of God.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.  If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest primes, because we can prove that they don't exist.  Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of the time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.  To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be tested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to prove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by default that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.  Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God exists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be possible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious book does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described by any present-day religion exists.  In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of God are not really applicable.  \\\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\\\"  If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction must be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable.  If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue that if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no importance whether he exists or not.  If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites. Surely he should still be detectable today?  Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically verifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him from all the other things that don't exist?  \\\"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but  isn't it still a religious belief?\\\"  One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \\\"the redefinition game\\\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:  Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out that it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He then records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to it, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \\\"agreed fact\\\", but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.  The point of this digression is that the answer to the question \\\"Isn't atheism a religious belief?\\\" depends crucially upon what is meant by \\\"religious\\\".  \\\"Religion\\\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and worship.  [ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not   \\\"religion\\\" according to such a definition. ]  Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of \\\"religious\\\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \\\"religious\\\" as well -- such as science, politics, and watching TV.  \\\"OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is  still just an act of faith, like religion is?\\\"  Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in.  Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt.  Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are the sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called \\\"acts of faith\\\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.  Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something. According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is \\\"certain\\\".  This is not a general tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists.  Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof. Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism has no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or the lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.  \\\"If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?\\\"  It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \\\"for\\\" or \\\"against\\\", \\\"friend\\\" or \\\"enemy\\\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.  Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense, it can be said to be \\\"anti-religion\\\".  However, when religious believers speak of atheists being \\\"anti-religious\\\" they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.  This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair. Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.  Most atheists take a \\\"live and let live\\\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they will not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of course, this may be in part because atheism is not \\\"socially acceptable\\\" in many countries.  A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \\\"convert\\\" others when possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.  (To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished.  The institution of \\\"state atheism\\\" came about when Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population.)  Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example, the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate.  \\\"But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,  surely that's the same as state atheism?\\\"  The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of another, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in nature.  Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For example, religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters, and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say.  \\\"What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people  pray?\\\"  Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things that those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in schools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they need not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event.  Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other motives.  \\\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about  atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't  atheists object to the religious charities?\\\"  There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for the sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis.  Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in connection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday matter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say self-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs.  To \\\"weak\\\" atheists, building a hospital to say \\\"I do not believe in God\\\" is a rather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say \\\"Today is not my birthday\\\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.  \\\"You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against  one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?\\\"  Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists.  It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the other hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others.  On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently.  \\\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\\\"  They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.  Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a Verdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts, they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy of the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!  Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance.  \\\"Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?\\\"  That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course atheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when one talks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\\\"right\\\") and unacceptable (\\\"wrong\\\") behaviour within society.  Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must co-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from \\\"anti-social\\\" or \\\"immoral\\\" behaviour, purely for the purposes of self-preservation.  Many atheists behave in a \\\"moral\\\" or \\\"compassionate\\\" way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care what happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.  Naturally, there are some people who behave \\\"immorally\\\" and try to use atheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who behave \\\"immorally\\\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions.  For example:    \\\"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ    came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was    shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited    patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive    eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,    be honor and glory forever and ever.\\\"  The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a religious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?     A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior    deteriorated after \\\"born again\\\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents    said they had driven intoxicated before being \\\"born again,\\\" 12% had done    so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before    conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex    before salvation; 5% after.                                 [\\\"Freethought Today\\\", September 1991, p. 12.]  So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour.  \\\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\\\"  If you mean \\\"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\\\", then the answer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people.  If you mean \\\"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\\\", then the answer is no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \\\"moral rules\\\" as theists, but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by humans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.  \\\"Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?\\\"  A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them.  Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are unbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.  This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that individual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only choice that person can honestly make.  \\\"But don't atheists want to believe in God?\\\"  Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many of them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the \\\"Big Brother\\\" figure might be.  Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of such an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.  \\\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are  unwilling in their souls to see!\\\"  Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained above, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God exists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.  Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded. Comments such as \\\"Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly\\\" are likely to be viewed as patronizing.  Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is futile.  \\\"Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\\\"  Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives meaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives count, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other people who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.  It is a natural human tendency to look for \\\"meaning\\\" or \\\"purpose\\\" in random events.  However, it is by no means obvious that \\\"life\\\" is the sort of thing that has a \\\"meaning\\\".  To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \\\"What is the meaning of life?\\\" is as silly as asking \\\"What is the meaning of a cup of coffee?\\\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.  \\\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\\\"  There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets. Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.  That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so what?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?  In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just hard luck.  \\\"Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\\\"  The short answer is \\\"No, do you?\\\"  Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.  Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of the existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.  \\\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments  apply?\\\"  No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is the sceptical \\\"default position\\\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism is a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.  Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers, but to everyone else.  \\\"What sort of harm?\\\"  Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings; think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on. Imagine how that effort could be better spent.  Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances of ill people being \\\"healed\\\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.  It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- and condoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many third-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.  Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion.  \\\"Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some  sort of excuse.\\\"  What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hard to tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all convinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight and kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REAL Christian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like the Catholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?  In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who calls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his actions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians are just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if the Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't be much of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he have made it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs aren't a perversion of what your God intended?  If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so? Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a Christian.  \\\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since  nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely  that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\\\"  That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue, positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns don't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.  It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \\\"weak\\\" atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still.  \\\"Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?\\\"  Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \\\"correct\\\" it is, or whether it \\\"works\\\"; consider how many people believe in astrology, graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.  Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.  Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world, we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other purposes as well.  \\\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say  something?\\\"  Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's worth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of concept of God in the Christian sense.  Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.  \\\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded  that God exists?\\\"  For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who does not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders.  A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.  \\\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates  nothing?\\\"  Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far.  The theory of memetics talks of \\\"memes\\\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure to keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes.  Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it.  \\\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important  messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\\\"  There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a few of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions.     There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.     Be especially sceptical of positive claims.     If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to    find it.     Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.     Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.     It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change    yourself.     Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.     If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.

According to Luke 3:23     And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about     thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,    the son of Eli,  Aside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible interpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother. Clearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son of Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man to whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at straws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no intention of tracing Mary's genealogy (in which case he would have named her) but that he traces her husband's, from David's son Nathan.  The Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's son, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:     And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born    Jesus, who is called Christ.   There are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the two paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David, Solomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph relavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was not Jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quite correct, that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on truth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus's divine nature was.  The second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not involved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy Spirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also capable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this work.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss solely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of purity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that neither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they had not \\\"known\\\"each other).  Thus the first gospel's dedication of half its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant to Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.  To the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more problems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating  the births of two entirely different children of two entirely different sets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and  the birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two  stories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years later with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his explanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge with their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his resolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external documents, and the discussion of \\\"how this could be\\\" might bring us beyond the limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the details are described in Steiner's \\\"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human  Being and of Humanity\\\", \\\"The Gospel of St. Luke\\\", and \\\"The Gospel of St. Matthew\\\".   Whether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted as valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent contradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.  As for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother, this was never an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary's Jewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal line of descent from David, the king.\",\"GB> From: geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks) GB> >(I am excepting migraine, which is arguably neurologic). GB> I hope you meant \\\"inarguably\\\".  Given the choice, I would rather argue <g>.  No arguments about migranous aura; in fact, current best evidence is that aura is intrinsicially neuronal (a la spreading depression of Leao) rather than vascular (something causing vasoconstriction and secondary neuronal ischemia).  Migraine without aura, however, is a fuzzier issue.  There do not seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The Copenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF studies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura, but like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.  From one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in the absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From another (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of the specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache, therefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.  Whether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling headaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic colleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients they can get.  Working on a salary, however, I would rather not fill my office with patients holding their heads in pain.\",\" Something else to consider:  Alomar's H-R splits were .500-.363 SLG, .444-.369 OBP!

First, there were intermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining 5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.  Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems. Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I then insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the IIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me another RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see the drive there's a definite hardware problem.  Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send me a *new* one, but they said \\\"no.\\\" Also, within three weeks after I purchased my original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.  I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these facts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again reinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data recovery.)  It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new.   I feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La Cie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful. But c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent a letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even  have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)  What's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy any other products from La Cie in the future.

This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through history.  The Greek, for example, could say, \\\"better a beggar in the land of the living than a king in the land of the dead.\\\" (Iliad, I think).  The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is an ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adam or Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in their sins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentile humanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to him.  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him, through whom Satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment.   It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely extended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imagine an eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.  It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous were lost. This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness that fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with the sense world.  It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient people's ideas of life after death.   Mankind fell into mist and darkness, and at \\\"the turning point of time\\\" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, and we are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much new revelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.  Our new vision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and much more as well.  (At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf Steiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my views on this subject).   The way you refer to it as \\\"doctrine\\\" puts a modern intellectual coloring on it. I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or teachings today can be received.  I am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed on, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception and experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different people's ideas of the time immediately after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  In any case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid, but by contemplating the principles themselves.  On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity that originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the human being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is created at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas dominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does today. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our eternal spiritual being had grown dim.   Indeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a single earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in terms that did not try to spell it out. \",\"--  73, Tom ================================================================================ Tom Wagner, Audio Visual Technician.

The following letter, which represents a small portion  of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical  documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs,  was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors,  program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and  radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide  of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people  of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the  lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is  mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their  lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations  may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and  prosperously.  ------------------------- letter ----------------------------------  During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government  has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which  not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the  method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day,  Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order  to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland,  which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia  continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:  1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility.  2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism  Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish  Genocide.  3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to  silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.  4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.  Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government  is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.  Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its  terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks  to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically  exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on  this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of  governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition  of the Turkish Genocide.  With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial demands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims of the Turkish Genocide demand:  1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian  Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;  2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and Kurdish people;  3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for  their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;  4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian political pressure;  5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it  has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially  recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be  supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;  6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact  of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of  2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.  The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first  genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new  generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically mature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through all necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the  armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon all Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in  the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.

Fixed disk sectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is quite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the controller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 wasn't cached, the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance, and it's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more loss of CPU cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence.  The floppy, on the other hand, is not buffered, so that using the CPU for floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr, by the way) really does stink.\",\"MJM>HI, I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related MJM>subjects.

The arrogance being attacked is that we \\\"think we are the only ones who know what the absolutes are\\\".  In short, many evangelicals claim that they are infallible on the matter of religious texts.  In particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can think of epistemology as \\\"how do you know?\\\"  That question, it turns out, is a very troubling one.  The problem with `absolute certainty' is that, at the bottom, at least some of the thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that everything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to discover a source of truth is in question.  And that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of authority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.   Let's take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional Inerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of Papal Infallibility, too.)  Zeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and several other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and possibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute Truth.  He may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct. His conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made mistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His conclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made mistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made mistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)  Everything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that happened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what he does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own infallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own reasoning, that belief cannot be considered \\\"absolutely certain\\\".  Zeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief is only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can say that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.  Any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on your own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible thinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.   This is easy to demonstrate.  Let's go back to our shorthand method of doing epistemology: \\\"how do you know?\\\"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:   A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.   B: How do you know?   A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church     teachings and came to this conclusion.   B: How do you know you studied history correctly?   A: Well, I double-checked everything.   B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?   A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.   B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn't mean it is     true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?   A: ...  And, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say \\\"I can't prove that there are no mistakes\\\" -- and as long as you may have made a mistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.  There is no way out of the loop.   This is where the \\\"arrogance of Christians\\\" arises: many people believe that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the doctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are infallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.  Claiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led you to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.   *  People who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to find _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking the idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well), but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is knowably Inerrant. \",\"I saw once an article about a new line of Macs configured to  work more optimally as file servers.

Thus, the line lies completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon, or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.  Now, the phrasing of this question says \\\"if a line intersects a polygon\\\", so this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.  In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript.  (See \\\"PostScript Language\\\", by Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).  So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P, and then \\\"outputs\\\" the answer.  By \\\"output\\\", we mean the program executes a command called \\\"showpage\\\", which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus the original problem.  There are two small problems with this approach.    (1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the  reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of  Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of  Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.   (2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the  PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in  other words, will it halt?   Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a  Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is  undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn  out to be undecidable.

By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc. 37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an acronym) is probably only NP-complete.

Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specifically the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats) will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user, and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed.  Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate with impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from key escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means.  Because life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal very large and conspicuous property (luxury cars), it is reasonable to assume that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous property (a cipher cellular phone).  Just as we have seen in the past with \\\"blue box\\\" technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones, we can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakes criminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stolen instruments.  Because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days, a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.  There will be a continuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies.  In other words, Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, and persistent threat to the general public.  On the other hand, if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a device in a mostly non-ciphered network, the communication will at least stand out as being unusual, and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation.  Finally, because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments, there will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communications in the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is discovered, and the instruments involved have been identified).  While recording and archiving may not be feasible for wireline networks, it is probably feasible across the more limited bandwidth of radio networks.

Alexander Mogilny led the comeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at 3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots on goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and LaFontaine all night.  Roster move:  Andre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy scratch.  Lines:  Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-McGill  Tommy Soderstrom  Game Summary:  Say, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that woman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!  The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have been shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the first period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday when they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that he was getting bored back there...  Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After Buffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead to Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed the puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and in on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the right past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and Garry should turn down their assists :-).  The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong and kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive struggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when Terry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into the boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not a terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got a post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.  Keith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to give the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league didn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a good scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards the end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept missing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give the Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots were 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.  Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered a rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the season went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was Russ Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed Snider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd do it all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the end of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup. He expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title the following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.  He's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \\\"outstanding\\\"). Happy with the current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable. Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a consensus.  The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May took a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble getting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres blue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling through the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.  Then Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line and went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was all over it.  The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them. Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when Barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer took a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln't get started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the FLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and headed the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to make it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John Muckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.  But the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to just get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all over them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through Soderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it. Mistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and mistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn't even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks end for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.  Lindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking minor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get set up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued to keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended. Things evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill allowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a faceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of him. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and that meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major, 7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.  The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long they could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to Ledyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by Soderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had moved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net at 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to put it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.  The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek was strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the neutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS blue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the left circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at 18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between the 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off angles...  That was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.  Into the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the FLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in the slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he hit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.  Than an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood untouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under Soderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on, horn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange reason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...  Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS could not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through, but were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck from a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass, but twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.  But the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate out, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew in, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at 5:24 to tie the game at 4.  Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up in the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in the middle. While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44.  Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19. The FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind'Amour and Ledyard went after it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated to the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing through the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season for Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th of the season.  Then Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres power play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the chances on the FLYERS resulting power play.  Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big saves. The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running  out as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres. Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found Dineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the right of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton chipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48 on his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo, and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the game.  So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much in his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night (unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so). The FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against with three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals despite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place since the Rangers lose the tie breaker.  A couple misc notes:  Forget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.  In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award, but I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.  The Times of Trenton has reported that \\\"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\\\" has looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near future.  Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he expected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back, he feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a role scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.

Or check out the medical dictionary cite which a doctor mentioned earlier in this thread?    Among others, see Olney's  \\\"Excitotoxic Food Aditives - Relevance of Animal Studies to Human Safety\\\" (1982) Neurobehav. Toxicol. Teratol. vol 6: 455-462.

Why don't *you* point us to some studies? Maybe then this exchange could be productive.   They're unable to metabolise it.   Who said anything about 'received wisdom'? There is no question that orally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence. These areas are responsible for the production of hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal development of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Now what, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brain necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing? Are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary, ANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone?   How do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It's unethical to \\\"sacrifice\\\" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food industry knows this. That's why the animal model is used in medicine and psych.  If you're talking about straight sensitivity, it would be useful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies on psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and physiology.  I suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities (You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its implication for adults (me).  Certainly the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than for the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copious and increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their hidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the endocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels* attained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC.    Olney's work provides a putative causal mechanism for some sensitivities. Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally administered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone fluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant supression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transient release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH is responsible not only for control of growth during development, but also converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause of headaches?

Also, buying good protective clothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong, you are likely to be less severely injured.  First thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course, this will get you started on the right foot -- they teach control of the vehicle and safe riding practices.  Second, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet and a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy  piece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking boots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine for this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay  tied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps are nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the pants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable, preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for a jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though more people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another thing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand leather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.  Third don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after  drinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement and balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditions are such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding in the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly,  brake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick, tired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or otherwise not in average shape.  With care, you should be ok.   I would suggest mid to late 80's japanese mid-sized standard. Something in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  If you are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as low as a 300-400 cc bike.  Possible models:  The Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally inline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to  weakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier  problems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650, it server me well.  The Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series I think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of standard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.  Kawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't know them as well.  For mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able to buy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective  clothing and insurance and licensing costs.\",\"    >>So good that there isn't any diff whether or not ATManager is turned    >>on or not.

I thought the whole idea of God coming down to earth to live as one of us \\\"subject to sin and death\\\" (as one of the consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was that Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity, then Jesus \\\"fully human\\\" (Nicea) would not be \\\"subject to sin\\\", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning, because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguish between \\\"human\\\" and \\\"fallen human\\\" makes Jesus less like one of us at the time we need him most.   First, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius's version -- they  were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical record suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as extreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history) claimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing (I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean, in the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \\\"uncreate\\\" -- surely even  Arians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius's opponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed that she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require two seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because Mary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely, if you accept \\\"Nestorianism\\\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined, a la Chalcedon.  Second, I am not sure that \\\"Nestorianism\\\" is not a better alternative than the orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think rather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate nature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine nature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature prevailed.  Comments on the above warmly appreciated.  Jason Albert  [There may be differences in what we mean by \\\"subject to sin\\\".  The original complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call Jesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree that Jesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by not succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do not have to sin in order to be human.  I again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I agree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to think that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in fact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was not Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of the correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he got the better of them.  However, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to Chalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least \\\"rash and dogmatic\\\" (as the editor of \\\"The Christological Controversy\\\" refers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As regular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an impediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I think are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from Cyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \\\"To attribute also to [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics of the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother, either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the Greeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and Apollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the idea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine Logos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his fearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us who perpetrate the falsehood.\\\"  It's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between humanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based on exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \\\"to some degree\\\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it must be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos' participation in these things.  But there must be some sort of identification between the divine and human, or we don't have an incarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white terms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this area.  You say \\\"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus's human nature was in heaven.\\\"  I don't think that's required by orthodox doctrine.  It's the divine Logos that is eternal.\",\"I want to create a single-line Text widget for entering a small amount of text.

The critical information from the neuron is in the firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials per seconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the signal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit convertor is more then sufficient.

The answers I received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working. However, during this process I have come up with new problems.  1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic string. Is this inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS or VB?  2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the DDE SQL command, (provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names) but how is one meant to update a database?    a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.    b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command from VB cannot       be used because when the macro requests information from VB using a       second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time- outs occur.       (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access to VB channel       is initiated, I guess.)    c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.      The way I eventually managed to update a database was by sending key-    strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. This technique has    the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a    state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB sends.  Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect assumptions? Are there any better work arounds to the above? Are there any signs of an ODBC driver for Access?\",\" Ok, so there are in fact two distinct components transmitted by the chip; the real message encrypted with the \\\"conventional\\\" key, and the serial number and encrypted \\\"conventional\\\" key encrypted with the (IMHO kind of bogus, as the whole concept of \\\"one key that millions of people use which can't be changed\\\" doesn't seem reasonable) \\\"family key\\\".

Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me, I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.  Very little sugar or salt.  Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are recommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard of people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are just too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)  My \\\"clean your plate\\\" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last 10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch up, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.  I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry shortly, and eating won't be practical then).  I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to stores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car. I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps build and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes runs in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable with a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if it drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess ounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim weight from the rider than from the vehicle.)  There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately, it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.  Obviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've done will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who did try it and didn't succeed.   I'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat. I usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty, my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comes off again over a week or two. --  Keith Lynch, kfl@access.digex.com\",\"Can someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral, other than Leviticus? So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses from Leviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be ignored by Christians (haven't seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).  Later, Max (Bob) Muir  [The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonly cited passages are:  the story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and there's no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate position on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the Bible for its sinfulness.  It doesn't seem to have been known specifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a cesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes, homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action described.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about as many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of guests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically about homosexuality.  In the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom 1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil. Note that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's about idolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at least result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this passage.  It does not use the word \\\"homosexuality\\\", and it is referring to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality. So it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality. But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway, that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards  homosexuality.  The other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim 1:10.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used here mean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning, such as \\\"wanton\\\", and that another may be specifically \\\"male prostitute\\\".  Again, we don't have here a precise teaching about homosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul shared the OT's negative judgement on homosexuality.  Jude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it's probably not relevant.  The context in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in Sodom were angels, it seems likely that \\\"strange flesh\\\" refers to intercourse with angels.  As you can see, the NT evidence is such that people's conclusion is determined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that the passages from Paul's letters imply that he accepted the OT prohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT endorsement.  Liberals note that there's no specific teaching, and no clear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in Rom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly do the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is legitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his background and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.  This is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long dissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it's clear to me that that's mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes down to is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they believe that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  This appears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the Bible as a whole, as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today. This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference between Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where both sides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they keep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the other side will finally come to their senses.  That makes things very frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimistic outcome is not very likely...\",\"Hello all,  You, the Net, are my last resort, or I'll just change my job :-) This might be a FAQ (e.g. mixing controllers) but haven't seen any.

Anyway, I think it would be a great idea to  develop such a product, perhaps in the underground, as it would otherwise  probably become illegal pretty quickly here...  It's really very feasible and shouldn't be too expensive - all that's needed is a box with a phone jack on one side, a DSP in the middle to do codec functions of speech->compressed bytestream, and an RS232 on the other side.  You'd plug your phone into it, plug the RS232 into your computer, and have a good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port.  The CPU in the middle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on a byte stream.  With v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream, it should work.  Quality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone.  At the very highest price, you could use one of those voice-mail compatible modems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 on the cost of such a box.  In practice, you really ought to be able to get the price well below $100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap&nasty home RISC box (Acorn Archimedes) with the digitising microphone I bought for 25 pounds, if I knew how to write good speech compression software (which I don't).  The reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one - the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip. Economics, I'm afraid.  However... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even with the bottleneck of a v32bis modem.  When we get ISDN for all (ha ha ha) and the new NREN, it might then be trivial to run compressed speech over a tcp/ip connection on the Internet.  Perhaps we should start thinking now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatible for everyone, and side-step the clipper stuff and use internet for all our phone calls in future :-)  [1/2 joking]\",\"Did you remember to clamp ground to the engine block first?\",\" Yes.

I'd like to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation consoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.  We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes, and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control circuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.  I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the cue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one problem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be a sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute, so to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid cuetape!)  Ideally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function. (A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film) This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second. What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit of some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!

Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not    yet have the spec)?  Motif 1.2 does not have a multi-column list in it.  Have you looked at commercial sets?  There are also some PD  widget sets,  one of these might have a multi-column list you could port.  \",\"Can someone please remind me who said a well known quotation?

Where can I get patches to X11R5?   The release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced in the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.   Patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other sites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the  newsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in  their source distributions of X11.   People without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has  23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line   send fixes # where # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.   Here are a few complications:  1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request \\\"5a\\\", \\\"5b\\\", \\\"5c\\\" and  \\\"5d\\\" separately  2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was  re-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with Solaris]  3) fix 8 is in two parts: \\\"8a\\\" and \\\"8b\\\"  4) fix 13 is in three parts: \\\"13a\\\", \\\"13b\\\", and \\\"13c\\\"  5) fix 16 is in two parts: \\\"16a\\\" and \\\"16b\\\"  6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which  previously was optional  7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff by asking for \\\"PEXlib.uu.[1234]\\\".  8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, \\\"22a\\\" through \\\"22i\\\"  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?   The xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail  it a request, and it mails back the response.  Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can  have several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help).  The xstuff server treats the \\\"Subject:\\\" header line just like any other line  of the message.  The archives are organized into a series of directories and  subdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an  index. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the  subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.   1) The command \\\"help\\\" or \\\"send help\\\" causes the server to send you a  more detailed version of this help file.  2) if your message contains a line whose first word is \\\"index\\\", then  the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then  the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index.  For example, you can say \\\"send index fixes\\\" (or \\\"index fixes\\\"). A message that  requests an index cannot request data.  3) if your message contains a line whose first word is \\\"send\\\", then the xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name  an item, you give its directory and its name. For example                 send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9  You may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many  safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large  amounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the  day's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day.  Whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out  shortest-first.  4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting  return addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response.  If  you happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like         path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu or         path bar!foo!frotz in the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.   The xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If  your mailer deals in \\\"!\\\" notation, try sending to  {someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.

You can obtain either OSF/Motif source or binaries from a number of  vendors.   Motif 1.2.2 source is now available; it is based on X11R5.  Motif 1.1 is based on the R4.18 Intrinsics and is currently [7/92] at  1.1.5.  An OSF/Motif source license must be obtained from OSF before source can be obtained from the Open Software Foundation or any value-added vendor for any version. Call the Direct Channels Desk at OSF at 617-621-7300 for ordering  information.  Various hardware vendors produce developer's toolkits of binaries,  header files, and documentation; check your hardware vendor, particularly if that vendor is an OSF member.   In addition, independent binary vendors produce Motif toolkits for machines for which Motif is not supported by a vendor; the kits include varied  levels of bug-fixing and support for shared libraries and are based on widely divergent version of Motif:  Quest (408-988-8880) sells kits for Suns, as well;   IXI (+44 223 462 131) offers kits for Sun3 and Sun4.

Motif 1.1.2 is  also available for Sun Sparc based workstations. It has also announced  Motif 1.2 for Solaris systems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  62)  Does Motif work with X11R4? X11R5?   Motif 1.2 is based on X11R5.  Motif 1.1, available in source form from OSF as of August 1990, uses  the \\\"vanilla\\\" X11R4 Intrinsics, where \\\"vanilla\\\" means \\\"with just a few  patches\\\"; the file fix-osf which OSF distributes is obsoleted by MIT's patches  15-17.  The file fix-osf-1.1.1 distributed with the 1.1.1 version or its  subsequent modification needs to be applied after MIT fix-18, though.   Motif 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 will work with X11R5 if X11R5 is compiled with -DMOTIFBC; 1.1.4 and later should work with the vanilla R5, although there are  some known new geometry-management problems.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  63)  Where can I get toolkits implementing OPEN LOOK?

Some widget sets have a widget particularly for this purpose -- a WorkSpace or DrawingArea which doesn't display anything but lets your Xt  application know when it has been re-exposed, resized, and when it has received user key and mouse input.   The best thing to do for other widget sets -- including the Athena set  -- is to create or obtain such a widget; this is preferable to drawing into a  core widget and grabbing events with XtAddEventHandler(), which loses a number  of benefits of Xt and encapsulation of the functionality .    At least one version has been posted to comp.sources.x (name???).   The publicly-available programs xball and xpic include other versions.   The Athena Widget manual (mit/doc/Xaw/Template in the R5 distribution)  includes a tutorial and source code to a simple widget which is suitable for  use.

It turns a Sun 3/50 into a pseudo- X  terminal; most of the overhead of the operating system is side-stepped, so it  is fairly fast and needs little disk space.  A similar approach is to run the regular X server by making /etc/init a shell script which does the minimal setup and then invokes Xsun, like this example script from mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.EDU:  #! /bin/sh exec >/dev/console 2>&1 /etc/fsck -p /dev/nd0 case $? in   0) ;;   4) /etc/reboot -q -n    ;;   8) echo ND fsck failed - get help    /etc/halt    ;;   12) echo Interrupted    /etc/reboot    ;;   *) echo Unknown error in reboot fsck - get help    /etc/halt    ;; esac /bin/dd if=/tmp-fs of=/dev/nd2 bs=512 count=128 >/dev/null 2>&1 /etc/mount /dev/nd2 /tmp /etc/ifconfig le0 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 132.206.41.255 /etc/mount -o ro apollo:/u2/x11/lib /local/lib/X11 /etc/route add default 132.206.41.1 1 >/dev/null set `/etc/ifconfig le0` exec /Xsun -once -multidisp -mux -query \\\\  `(sh -vn </local/lib/X11/xdm-servers/$2 2>&1)`  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  76)  What terminal emulators other than xterm are available?

In that post you stated that the \\\"wrap\\\" was on top of and in addition to any overhead. Geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true.   Come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing what and who is working on integration. This is simply an ad hominum attack and you know it.   Of course there is a fee. It is for administration. Geez Allen any organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate costs, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support a program and \\\"wrap\\\" as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you say is not true. Which is it Allen?   As you have posted on this subject Allen, you state that wrap is over and above overhead and is a seperate charge. You admit here that this is wrong. Nasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get some numbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then howl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.   Integration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was  done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of Reston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There is no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project that it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for  Apollo?   Oh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big. They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it replaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your bias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just how wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it.    I agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful large scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that integration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called leadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for the success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership and responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up as Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC and they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to finally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.  There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that for a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of leadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a symptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your efforts that you do not see this.   No, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have  happened in the first place.  I have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is at reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened, totally ignoring the lack of leadership of congress. This many headed hydra that has grown up at NASA is the true problem of the Agency and to try to  change the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of your position.\",\"For sale:  Precision drafting machine, Bruning OGP-0180.

It was the Phils only win in the three game series, and was the first time the Phillies have lost a series in the young season.   The Phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2 John Kruk 2-run homers and two Wes Chamberlain homers.  However Danny Jackson, and the Phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead. Mitch Williams entered the game with the Phillies leading 8-4, however Candy Maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it.  In the 11th, Dave Hollins hit a three-run shot, his first of the year to push the Phils ahead to stay.  However, in a shaky bottom of the 11th the Cubs scored 2 runs and had the tying runner on base when the Cubs pinch hit Randy Myers for Bob Scanlan (they were out of position players) and Myers bunted into a double play to end the game.\",\"  Harumph. Getting published in these newsletters is hardly something to aspire to. :-)  I can't really argue with your logic, though I think you may be extrapolating a bit recklessly from what appears to be a sample size of one. Even if what you say about this local Pittsburgh guy is true, it is not logical or fair to conclude that this is true of all doctors who treat Lyme disease.  By your logic, I could conclude that all of the physicians who consult for insurance companies and make money by denying benefits to Lyme patients are doing it for the money, rather than because they believe they are encouraging good medicine. I have no idea how sincere these guys are, but their motives are as suspect as the physicians you excoriate for what you believe to be indiscriminate treatment.  I would really feel more comfortable discussing the medical issues in Lyme, rather than speculating as to the motives of the various parties involved. \",\"I just recently bought a 4 MB ram card for my original mac portable  (backlit) and have since had some bizarre crashes.

Also please explain the particular rules that make it okay for terrorists to launch missiles from Lebanon against Israeli civilians, but not okay for the Israelis to try to defend themselves against those missiles. \",\" Perhaps you're using the wrong brand! (Sorry all HP fans, but I have a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their (excellent) gear).  One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is whether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock the instrument into real time capture mode.   I agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are _beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus. However, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students) seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or more knobs required of a \\\"real\\\" scope :-)   This is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at least they appear to be logically laid out.  One more thing about the new, \\\"simpler\\\", front panels. These instruments tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the longevity of the instruments.

It took place in the first intermission of game 1 of the Montreal-Quebec series.   Pre-game comments ----------------- Don's pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies... The goalie who gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series for his team.  Eposode Summary --------------- This episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that he bought from the concession stand.  Ron Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the Toronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow and proclaimed \\\"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks of me. Beauty.\\\"  Next, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to him, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all the arenas in the NHL.  From there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game had great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game in the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All stop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary by Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most penalties gets to ref in the finals.  Next, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for the Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the wins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup and the AHL championships.  Finally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the Rangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved. Don feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had several key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who went cold.

The USA has a higher imprisonment rate (400 per 100,000 population) than any country in Europe by a factor of 10 or so.  In California, it is over 600 per 100,000 population.  The prison population in California is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980.  Most of these inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws.  Police now confiscate property, without trial, under a \\\"good faith probable cause\\\" standard, in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drug dealers of their ill-gotten gains.  Conduct an opinion poll, and a majority will answer \\\"yes\\\" if you ask them whether civil liberties and due process should be diluted in order to Send Our Young People The Message That We Are Serious About Winning The War On Drugs.

According to Jack Herer's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_, over TWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under the marijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their own business and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselves than users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year).  Under the \\\"War on Drugs\\\" campaign of \\\"zero tolerance\\\" due process protections have eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have proliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicians who favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not only legal, but political:  \\\"My fellow Americans, we must send our young people the message that we are serious about winning the War On Murder\\\"--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun prohibition laws.

I was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist, so I have stated this Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about 18.  For some reason, I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the resurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean the raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:  1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was  pretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right now.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the \\\"great judgement\\\" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day). I was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the church -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my \\\"soul\\\" (which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?  2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms  that my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My physical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal so it can be tortured for all eternity?  3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical place to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth? Do you think we could find it if we dig?  Mark Schnitzius schnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.edu Univ. of Central Florida  [There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I think the most common view is that final disposition does not occur until a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the meantime, some believe that people \\\"sleep\\\" until the final resurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death to the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe that souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then. There are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.  The new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a different \\\"technology\\\" than the current one, one which is not mortal. (Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus' resurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not subject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other, but I don't think most people claim to know the details.  I don't think I'd say it's the same atoms.  I'd assume there would be some analog of a physical place, but I wouldn't expect to find it under the earth or up in the sky.  I'd suspect that it's in another dimension, outside this physical world, or whatever.  But again, we have little in the way of details.\",\"I've heard that you can score on Belfour by shooting high  because he goes down a lot, and on Potvin by shooting high  on him and then getting the rebound in because he plays so deep in the net.

He wrote it around 1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all that.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.  Joe Buehler  ...  Schism and Disobedience  According to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the Church united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.  The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection of the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend \\\"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\\\"  It adds that \\\"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\\\"Not only does Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command, but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and his intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \\\"We pray for the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations last June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he is a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor heresy.\\\"  ...  Intrinsically Schismatic?  The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is not true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917 Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope, that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman Pontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the Church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in response.  It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The first part deals with \\\"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the Church\\\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the Church.  But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" which is entitled \\\"Usurpation of Ecclesial Functions and Offenses in their Exercise\\\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is Canon 1382, which reads: \\\"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication reserved to the Holy See.\\\"  The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder.  I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father Patrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs actuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel Church.  Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to      The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not     in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with     offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses     against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are     apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a     pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the     exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the     consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh     Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated     he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because     there was no intention of a breach with the Church.  ....  It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy, and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon Law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred excommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the Church and the salvation of souls.  Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce Association, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he knows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and the Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February 1989 Remnant merits careful study:\",\"  Uh, I'm afraid that your information is slightly out of date...

I assumed that the ol' timers would recognize it for what it is.   Nevertheless, how about a list o' nicknames for alt.atheism posters? If you think of a good one, just post it and see if others like it. We could start with those posters who annoy us the most, like Bobby or Bill.  Jim \\\"D'oh!

[I am WAY to liberal with my quotation marks tonight...]  In this so-called (by me) speech, the character is expressing what  a lousy father he had and he made an interesting point.  He said something to the effect of: \\\"You have to have a license to drive a car.  You have to have a license to own a dog.  You even have to have a license to fish. But, they'll anyone have a kid.\\\" [Keep in mind that I am, in NO way, trying to pass this off as a quote.

At this point the stock anemic 302 would get  short of breath.  This of course was equivalent to about 116mph (hehe).I bet  I really coulda confused this thing if I'd toyed with the engine and rolled the stupid thing (the digits were limited to 199).

My main purpose for posting it here is to show that a _plausible_ argument can be made against extra-marital sex.  At this stage I am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or anything like that, just that it is plausible.  To try to convince you all of this particular point of view, I would probably have to do a lot of work researching what has been done in this field, etc., in order to gather further evidence, which I simply do not have time to do now.    Also note that I said that I think extra-marital sex is \\\"a prime cause\\\" (in my opinion) of the generally greater levels of psychological problems, especially depression, in Western societies.  I am not saying it is \\\"the prime cause\\\" or \\\"the only cause\\\", just \\\"a prime cause\\\" -- i.e. one of the significant contributions to this trend.  I think when you say you think my view is simplistic, you have forgotten this -- I admit that there are probably other factors, but I do think that extra-marital sex (and, IMO, subsequent destabilization of the family) is a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems like depression in Western society this century.\",\"Why don't you just run one LED at 60 KHz and use a flip flop at the receiving end to divide by 2 and give you a good square 30KHz signal. Just a thought. LORI  \",\" Of course if this question was asked in a group dealing with economics, the answer would be that the cause of war was economic. My observations over the past 30 years (and not withstanding a little history reading beside) is that while religious differences do play a part in many of the conflicts, so does (unfortunately) race, economics and any other items that identify one group of men as being different from another.  If we want to couch the cause of conflict in Christian terms, I would put it while Christ died for our sins, we are yet sinners. While some individuals assume \\\"Christlike\\\" natures, most of us do not even come close.  I realize that in many ways this is a trite answer, but I guess that it is my way of rationalizing man's constant (or so it seems) conflict.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------\",\"  OK, the small programme that can be used to switch a SunCD drive into 2048 bytes/block mode for use with MSDOS/Adaptec/APSI it now available by 'ftp' from   ftp.novell.de (193.97.1.1) pub/pc/adaptec/cdblksize.zip\",\"   I am one of those middle-of-the-road GW2000 owners who is satisfied with my system.

It is not lenient. End of argument.   And chopping off the hands or heads of people is not lenient either. It rather appears that you are internalized the claims about the legal system without checking if they suit the description.   And wasn't the argument that it takes five men to rape a woman according to Islamic law?       No, I even believe what I don't like. Can you give better answers than that? Have you got any evidence for your probably opposite claims?       A fact, if memory serves. And most will see the connection between the primitive machism in the Orient and in Islam.     As usually you miss the point. Aids is  neither spread only through sex nor necessarily spread by having sex. Futher, the point is, a very important point, the urge for sex is stronger than the fear of AIDS. It is even stronger than the religious attempts to channel or to forbid sex. The consequences of suppressing sex are worse than the consequences of Aids. Please note that the idea that everybody would end up with AIDS when sex is not controlled is completely counterfactual.  \",\"     Yes, but... the minimization of gates is important in part because of TIMING considerations.  A TTL gate has the basic structure of AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is just exactly ONE gate delay.  The reason to find a minimal sum of products is that this matches a hardware optimization.   A positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) has TWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term) so that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can  be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world. ECL is similar to TTL, in that it can support an OR/AND gate with the minimum delay (unlike TTL, you get both true and inverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL).   PALs are basically large programmable AND/OR/INVERT gates (with your choice of internal connections between the various sections, and perhaps some latches), so a minimum sum of products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into  a few PALs.  It's not comparably easy to design with a minimization of logic gates, but some software packages claim to allow you to do so, and will take just about any mess of gates (as a nodelist with 74xxx series logic ICs) and produce a description of a logic cell array to do the same job.  Xilinx's XACT software does this by treating each logic block as a macro, and expanding it all out, then simplifying.\",\"We no longer use quarter inch tape for backups, and have a case of unopened DC6150s for sale.  I'll sell the lot, or in boxes of 5 tapes each. \",\"          Good I had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case with no solution that worried me.  Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere  that they are on the surface of. Similarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the surface of.  These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design meet these problems neatly.  When determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear the algorithm should afil or return infinite R. When intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilities they are the same line  (the 4 points were on a planar circle) they are different lines but parallel. There is a sphere of in radius.  This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point by taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced  it can also be achieved by  If all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle.   It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar. The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar. (4 points being colinear => coplanar)  Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 points has been found is trivial.  \",\"tes: . s.  Or mug me.

RTF files are generated by a wordprocessor like Word for Dos or W4W.  If this is not the solution be more specific about your application.  Mario\",\" Ah, we are looking for good people just like you. We are a very concerned group of citizens who are absolutely disgusted at the way that the majority of drivers simply disobey traffic rules like going above the speed limit, passing on our right, and riding our tails, while all the while we respectfully abide by the rules of this great country and maintain the mandated speed limits with our calibrated, certified cruise controls, while keeping the respectful 1.5 car length distance/10 mph speed. How many times have you been ticked off by some moron who jumps ahead in the (5.5 * 1.5)8.25 car lengths  that you have left between you and the vehicle ahead of you while driving 55 mph? Finally you have an option. We are a totally member supported group that perform functions for our own good, for the good of this great country  but MOST of all for those unfortunate ones that are too stupid to realize it, bless their souls. For a paltry $10, you can join Citizens for Rationally  Advanced Piloting(C.R.A.P), a non-profit, members only, society. But, but,but, there is a slight hitch, the initiation rite. To be a full fledged member of this exclusive club, you must proof that you are able to be in the fast lane of the busiest interstate in your area, keep the correct 1.5 car lenth/10 mph speedand I know this can be difficult with those morons around, NOT let anybody pass you, not in the next lane, not in the slow lane, not in the breakdown lane, not NOWHERE. For a complete list of acceptable interstates and times, send $5. And by the way, over 90% of our members are highly regarded attorneys in the auto field and they are completely, absolutely positively in the business ONLY to serve your best interests. As a testament to their virtues, they will give members 90% off the initial consultation fee.

The cost is $299, but there  are no license royalties. His name is Eric Johnson in Sacramento, CA phone  916/737-1550. He doesn't have email. Very nice guy... very knowledgeable about  graphics. Seems like he may have a decent package. It's an Object Pascal Framework  that supposedly has a fairly complete set of geometry creation classes.

It is true that TrueType fonts are larger than their ATM counterparts, but ATM fonts *do* get minimal compression. Running Stacker 3.0 report generator, I get:    File Type:      Compression Ratio:   -------------   ------------------   *.TTF (TrueType)     1.4:1.0   *.PFB (ATM)          1.1:1.0   *.PFM (ATM Metric)  11.8:1.0  Although the metric files are small, they compress quite largely. And, as you can see, even the regular .PFB files have *some* compression.  So, doing the math on one such comparitive font file:  TTF Times = 83260 bytes/1.4 = 59471 bytes (compressed) PFB Times = 51549 bytes/1.1 = 46862 bytes (Compressed)  You still win out, even if the ATM Times font *isn't* compressed.

Just curious as to whose bias we are going to see when the numbers  get brought out.     --    bram \",\" I agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result in 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400% does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning by .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus, before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is.   The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a player who gets an out gets a \\\"negative probability\\\" in most cases. Thus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes, they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also, the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given them a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.       No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score  in the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The offence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If I am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth.           No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look, if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers, fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \\\"negative chance\\\" that the team would win.   From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda. At first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really does not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens. So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to player performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15% on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%. I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.  How do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's, etc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched in closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more valuble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better  pitcher?  They were probably about the same.\",\" Gerry Cheevers used to have a mask that had stitches painted all over it.\",\"Forsale:  Proton P1100 preamplifier ========================= About 3.5 years old, originally $299, asking $150 or best offer.

Looks like you can squeeze speech into 4000bps if you have a fast enough computer like a sparcstation (or a Newton with the Acorn Risc Machine in it :-) )  This drops the bandwidth to so low a figure that it's feasible to run speech over tcp/ip running on top of slip down a v32bis modem.  Not only will this let us run point to point encrypted speech, it'll let us run speech internationally over the internet if no-one stops us by getting *very* heavy about regulations.  The thought of this, if the administration realised, would probably scare them shitless.  Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol for internet speech *damn fast*, allowing anyone who feels brave to inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our workstations.  Shouldn't be too difficult.  The CELP stuff is standardised, we use tcp/ip streams, and a protocol allowing silences to be used to catch up on any net lag, and also to avoid sending any data during silences (ie it's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each end because any net delays would add up to big voice-lags)  As for me, I'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as I get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone. It'll save me a fortune in calling my friend in texas every night :) (whether encrypted or not)  You know, surely *someone* is working on this.  Who?  It's so obvious, why doesn't it exist already?

With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that their faith will survive this land.     \\\"There is a fear - a real fear, too,\\\" said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette. \\\"We have one generation to do it or to die.\\\"     Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land. But for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.     Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where \\\"historical sites\\\" are sometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great Persian Empire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ was born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three Zoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians, Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the Zoroastrian prophet.     Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are  a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a people is very much on their minds.     Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance of the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause their young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they actually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children become totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than the world at large - who will be the losers.     \\\"It's important to have an identity,\\\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose, a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \\\"It's important for everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life. You don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect. You can fall back on your own identity.\\\"     For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.     Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was only one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which translates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.  _Good vs. evil_     Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with the good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for good, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity, kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.     But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to follow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact, Joseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths, traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of Mount Hamilton, is \\\"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\\\"     So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India, where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape persecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy; the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.     About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India and Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from Iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state where others had no rights.     Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \\\"good deeds\\\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose, the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because Manou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's dedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the Zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.     The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an Iranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples in North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount Hamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto, and Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on this continent.     Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the property already had a large house that they have converted to a community center.     The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet  Zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted  ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.     Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed- in area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are  sometimes called \\\"fire worshippers,\\\" they actually consider fire just  a symbol of God.  \\\"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the  cross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\\\" Bhujwala said.     The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all Iranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With Zoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the United States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.    For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people came to worship and revel.     \\\"The good things in life are not forbidden,\\\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani, a leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed proved him right.     Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking sandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit and nuts.     Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \\\"People eat the fruit,\\\" Tarapore said.  \\\"It's a way to participate in the ceremony.\\\"  _Santa Claus, sort of_     The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white hair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green symbolic of spring) and red.     He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and played a tambourine.     The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \\\"This is all new for us, too,\\\" one told a visitor who asked what was going on.     A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with the religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have no procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their centuries of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu king who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his people's religion.     But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the San Jose temple whenever he can.     \\\"When I first heard about this religion,\\\" he said, \\\"I thought, my God, this is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.     \\\"People who don't have a tradition, something to lean on, what's the difference with the lower animals?\\\"\",\"oldham@ces.cwru.edu (Daniel Oldham) babbles:  What happened in Waco is not the fault of the BATF. If they would of had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened.   If they'd gone to the door and knocked on it to serve the  warrant, like the Sheriff had done 3 other times, they  wouldn't have needed to HAVE an initial assault.  But then,  Herr Klinton and Attorney Gen'l Reno wouldn't have been  able to have told such heroic stories about how they  \\\"protected\\\" the rest of us from a group of people who  kept to themselves, miles out in the prairie.  The BATF needs more people, better weapons and more armored transports. When they meet hostile fire they should be able to use more force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going to do a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they must have the proper equipment and people to do the job.   The BATF needs to be disbanded.  This out of control group  of Rambo wannabees is a danger to the Republic.  With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed more now then ever. If they blast away a few good fokes then that is the price we all have to pay for law and order in this country.   Well, I figure you're going to get flamed pretty badly by  everybody else for this incredibly stupid statement, so I'll  just let it pass for now.   Case Western reserve, huh?  Do the Feds know about that big   stockpile of automatic weapons and crack you have in  your  house?  Are you the same Daniel Oldham that lives on Orchard  Drive?  Just so they get the address right, that is...  Look at all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country of ours.   Well, it used to be a great country.  Now I'm not so sure.    I knew a few of those good people who died in wars;  I was  in Viet Nam.  I can assure you, none of us fought to protect  the right of the government to attack its own citizens with  military force without provocation.  (Hint: serving a search warrant  is NOT sufficient provocation to stage a military style assault  on a religious group.  At Least not here in the US.  Maybe in  Iraq, or Syria...)  With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with mega fire power. They could of gone in there blasting and killed a few women and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn to death 51 days later.\",\"I recently had a case of shingles and my doctors wanted to give me intravenous Acyclovir.

I'm not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx in advance)  I want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? There \\\"....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies.\\\"          Thanx in advance... Shaz....  [I'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions. The primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style of the translation.  It's pretty unusual to see significant differences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying text.  That's because before printing, manuscripts were copied by hand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the original, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are generally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are something like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved, but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don't think there's much uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of translating is free of error.  But I also don't think there's enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that it has much practical effect.  Whether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot topic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it (though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details that don't affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there being multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in all the versions.  I'm surprised to find a reference to this on the title page though.  What version are you talking about?  I've been referring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get referenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been editions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into single narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor objects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible has long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making editions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from a variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine one of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all inaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it's not any edition that's widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is. (Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It's been alleged that a few translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize inconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best, I'm afraid.)\",\" Actuallay I don't, but on the other hand I don't support the idea of having one newsgroup for every aspect of graphics programming as proposed by Brian, in his reply to my original posting. I would suggest a looser structure more like a comp.graphics.programmer, comp.graphics.hw_and_sw The reason for making as few groups as possible is for the same reason you say we shouldn't spilt up, not to get to few postings every day. I takes to much time to browse through all postings just to find two or  three I'm interested in.  I understand and agree when you say you want all aspects of graphics in one meeting. I agree to some extension. I see news as a forum to exchange ideas, help others or to be helped. I think this is difficult to achive if there are so many different things in one meeting.  Good evening netters|-)\",\"1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes and game reports. ------------------------------------------------- Kings 6 @ Calgary Flames 3 - 04/18/93  The third place Kings opened the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs in Calgary, against the second place Flames and came out with an impressive 6-3 victory in front of a non-sellout crowd of 18,605 at the Saddledome in Calgary.  Symthe Division playoff hockey this was.  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the opening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out- standing team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record their first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on penalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play  and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had their problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10 tries.  The Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the blue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the  Flames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex- pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse in his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to  the dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this  morning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.  1st period:  1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won the draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the puck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up in 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where Sydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the  hash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.  Millen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings failed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert. Dahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30 second 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in the period.  2nd period:  The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed to convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into the stands and received a delay of game.  1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the puck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit  the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated  down the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and skated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him  and he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.  2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play. Shuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed for the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot  where 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson came from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot between the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.  3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off the puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass cross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot, beating a diving Vernon on the glove side.  4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his own rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.  Skrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at 12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they failed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive power plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high sticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The Kings hit 3 goal post in the period.  3rd period: The Kings used the phrase \\\"Initiate, not retaliate\\\" and it was very evident here in the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames  continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.  5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot the puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to cut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him, wacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the crease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.  Sydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.  5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the  crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.  Carson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury tripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where  Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing  a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the  Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at  8:19) took penalties.    5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near  point, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the net, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of Hrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.  6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play to seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone  cut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed  the puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass,  beating Vernon on the ice, stick side.  At the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he went after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames right out of the game.  On the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey as they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent penalty killing.  On the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or the Flames will surely get that power play back on track.  Notes: ------ The Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.  Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.  The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving the opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.  Flames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon  games.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power play over their last 9 games.  The teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season.

NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is NCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such  software packages available.  X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running X11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and  is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote.   It seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard, there will be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various  sorts of hardware.

Hope you like it.      Put up with anything to prevent sin St. Maria Goretti        Maria was born on October 16th 1890 to Luigi and Assunta Goretti,     the  eldest  daughter  in the family of seven. She was a cheerful     girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but     one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.      The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on     the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-     nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally     arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and     give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon     on the  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love     we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to     die rather than commit a mortal sin.      Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy     Eucharist. Her  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father's     absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the rest  of  the     day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is     until         -4-            her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.     Thus ended the happiest day of Maria's life.      Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling     little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her     mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband, Maria     took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.     She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the     Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti's, owning     a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other     children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she     did the Holy Will of God.      During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son) twice     made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On     both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro's     strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she     even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria lived     in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.       On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  \\\"get  a     handkerchief,\\\"  as he  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath     the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the     baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered     what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a     91/2\\\"  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told     him she wouldn't go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He     stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia     instantly realized what he was up to. \\\"No, No, No! Do  not touch     me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!\\\" At this point Alessandro     held the knife over Maria's chest, who was now on the floor.      \\\"Will you or will you not?\\\" Maria gathered all her energy. \\\"No I     will  not, Alessandro,  no!\\\"   She had chosen her martyrdom over     sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the     knife  into   Maria's  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to     his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the     knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying     of the baby Teresa on  the  landing  brought  the attention  to     Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended     and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find     Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.     When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   \\\"He     wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.\\\"      The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro away.     As the  ambulance carried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd     followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for     poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First     Communion         -5-            came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.     He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  \\\"Yes.  For the     love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me     in Paradise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have.\\\" Maria     died at about three o'clock.      Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria's  death  but     because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in     prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-     ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of     a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to     him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God's par-     don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony     in Maria's  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,     on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the     first mother ever to be present at her daughter's canonisation.      May St. Maria Goretti help us  to be  pure  and  grant  us  the     strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.      Saint Maria Goretti, pray for us.       by Brendan Arthur \",\"Has anyone had any experience with a replacement comm driver for windows called TurboComm.

Should I call Apple to complain? =)  Derek \",\" First off, let me congratulate you for not posting a flame about \\\"You sick perverts, you are immoral, you are all going to hell.\\\", which seems to be the usual \\\"religious\\\" post found on the alt.sex.* hierarchy.  Hopefully, you won't get flamed, either.  You will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is built on unsteady ground.  First, I do not believe that there is any way to find an \\\"objective morality\\\".  Morality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a person or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even overwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.   Second, I do not accept the assumptions that you make here.  If, as you say, you are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by using the Christian Bible?  You're defeating your own purpose by doing so.    Third, call me a pessimist, but you won't stop the flamage.  There will always be people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we all are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the religion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring, overbearing totalitarianists?    Hm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to discuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I start off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex with you.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of your own gender.  (Just a note: I really don't know your views on homosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the purposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to have their faces uncovered.  The sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but feels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind.                                                                              (Evidence deleted)  I'm not going to accept your evidence for this.  You ask us to accept \\\"The Word of God\\\" that everything good comes from God.  This is only a valid argument for a person who shares your beliefs.  Still, I must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could be interesting for other reasons than yours, so good luck with this next part.   Hmmm...do I detect just a wee bit of condescence here?                                                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     not very objective.    One could construe this to mean that beautiful people are better, or \\\"more good\\\" than non-beautiful people.  I would hope that people relize that this is not necessarily true.                                           ^^^^       Might I suggest the word \\\"penis\\\"? It seems more in line with the tone of your post.              Bravo!  I respect you and your sense of humor, sir.                                                     Yes, and this theme is usually what the better stories are about.  However, they are not always selfish - I could point to examples in the work of Elf Sternberg, for example.   It serves the same purpose as it does in pornographic movies: it affirms the virility of the male involved, as well as assuring the reader that he (the character) has orgasmed.                         Your Whole Picture [TM] unfortunately only applies to people who accept your church.           In addition, if sex is for procreation, then  1) Why did God make it pleasurable, so that people would want to do it, rather than building it in as instinct? 2) Why did God make it fallible?  Not every sexual encounter results in pregnancy, even among Catholics.  Does this mean that they have sinned?     Granted.   Pornography would not tend in those directions if there were not a demand for it.  Many people have violent fantasies that they would never act out in real life, but will think about and read about and mull over.

People might quibble about what \\\"intrinsically\\\" means but the reason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we are. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good, but great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a  different technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we do not realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking  on water until a little doubt crept in.  Doesn't David ask in the 8th Psalm \\\"what is man that you [God]  should care for him, but you have made him just a little lower  than the angels\\\"?  I probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid David was, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliath was, but David's power easily defeated Goliath's.  Remember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks what he can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments. I always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done that his whole life, probably anticipating an \\\"attaboy\\\" from the  Messiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything and follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples say how can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people. Jesus says anyone can do it, with God's help.  Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid getting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committing adultery, we can control our own desires.   I realize this was not your main point, but I wonder how other people see this.    (Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make.)  Your point about how \\\"hard\\\" other religions are is a good one, just  as your \\\"Parting Question\\\" is a tough question. I think that Muslims worship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name \\\"submission\\\". Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that \\\"God\\\" is impersonal.  Is God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a little more my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater  to be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but you're right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think more I must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond my conception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu's conception. If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmology then maybe I wouldn't have a problem, though that is hard to imagine.

Some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they  were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for \\\"numbers\\\" (though  secretly afraid of them). Others steered clear of such puzzle books because  they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern  mathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't  know how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were  no exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a  specialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \\\"I willingly confess that  any time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was a hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of  my friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route --constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid  using algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it's a fact that is  well known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates,  nor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers (nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It  seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade  teachers.\\\"  Now, I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the  bookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to  recommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most  fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a  relatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to Venus and back.     One for the \\\"road\\\"   They both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley   glanced at the Royal Astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with   a group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. \\\"God   knows what this kind of stuff leads to,\\\" thought Kingsley.   The Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley's book and saw the History   of Herodotus. \\\"Good Lord, next he'll be reading Thucydides,\\\" thought   the Royal Astronomer.      --Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud  The book I'm talking about isn't very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24  elegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same time, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these  problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian  architecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is  now Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant  letters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of  Komitas, or the paintings of Saryan.  An edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a  bibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions of Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh  Century (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).  The abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way  of life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and  worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years  the book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in  Armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just anyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk  Father Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has  brought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the  general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable  problem book.    Vardapet Anania of Shirak   Once fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no   philosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering   it the mother of all wisdom.      --Anania of Shirak  Among ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because  of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his  work. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and Solutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation of scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and Armenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last work was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia,  Movses of Khoren).  In his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:   I, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our  Armenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately,   in the expression of the psalmist, \\\"every day I illuminated the   eyes of my mind.\\\" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,  I came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy,   the mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia   neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the   sciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man   named Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me  that in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,  Christosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But          soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but          only of certain fragmentary facts.   I then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me:   \\\"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the   coast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full   of wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature.\\\" I asked   them how they knew this. They answered: \\\"We saw ourselves that many   people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man.   Indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,  Philagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become   pupils of Tyukhik.\\\" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to   God, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.   I went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I   He sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St.   Gregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself   lived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there.\\\"   Vardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with   me. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated   the science of number, and with such success that my fellow students  at the king's court began to envy me.   I spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not   been translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable   collection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan,   books on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why   enumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did   not have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating  that when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into   Armenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the   translation read as if the work were written in that language   originally.   Tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had   learned the Armenian language. \\\"When I was young,\\\" he said, \\\"I lived   in Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and   for a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I   served as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and   literature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was   wounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to   the Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: \\\"If You prolong my life,   I shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to   collecting treasures of knowledge.\\\" And the Lord heard my prayers.   After I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria   and Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher   from Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned   to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\\\"   After some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for   him, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to   assume the teacher's position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to   God not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because  of his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study   with him.   And I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from   him this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our   country, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God's   help, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me   for my efforts.      Problems and Solutions   A half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed  on verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper;   one forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and   forty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many   copies were printed in all.      --Imitation of Anania of Shirak  A Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\\\"books have their own fate\\\"). The fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The manuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because, according to  Armenian historians, \\\"in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded  from invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children.\\\" Biding their time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of  ancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts). And its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two  manuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction  and commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited,  annotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a  member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).  In the translator's words, the problems of Anania are \\\"amusing, full of life,  and simple.\\\" Orbeli goes on to say: \\\"The subjects of the problems are  generally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland  Shirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are  named, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a  contemporary of Anania.\\\" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used  only \\\"aliquots\\\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is necessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to  represent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).  Like any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the  retelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their  full glory. So let's open Anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages.  Problems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D.  572.  Problem 1  My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the  Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary  heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops.  The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time,  pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third  time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were  still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from  this remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.  Problem 8  During the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak Kamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the Persian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a  day. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent  riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in  a day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.  Problem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian  translation, they are all called \\\"dishes.\\\" But in the original Armenian,  according to Orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are  called mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian  word, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before  Anania's Problems and Solutions.  Problem 18  There was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the  metal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from one fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten  drams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.  Several of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in  Anania's time -- for instance, problem 7.  Problem 7  Once I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank  of the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast.  We caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped out of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found  forty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.  The temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I'll restrain myself and offer you just one more.  Problem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that  inhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no mention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according  to the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of  Shirak offers evidence to the contrary .  Problem 20  The hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik,  was at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild donkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and,  running to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with his brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild  beasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by  arrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were  caught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And  so, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.    \\\"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli\\\"   His biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a   bibliography.     -- K Uzbashyan, Academician      Iosef Abgarovich Orbeli  Anyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the  solution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation  of Anania of Shirak's Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages, has probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders,  and the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great  attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for  a degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma  attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An  advertisement at the end of the book reads: \\\"This book was typeset in  December 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by  me, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with  borders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project  to the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.\\\"  Typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned  orientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage  Museum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had  already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis  Academiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its  rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish  the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian  churches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve  the unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G. Strolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the  blockade of Leningrad in World War II.)  When Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times  were hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania was for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the  printer's craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the  Academy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion of Russian academic typography.     Back to Earth   This book by definition does not exhaust all the most important   works in this domain. The editor hopes that those who are guilty   of this incompleteness will read these lines and, stung by shame,   will work up, if not a collection like this, at least a monograph.     --V. Bonch-Bruyevich introduction to the    Russian translation of Solid-Body    Symmetry by R. Knox and A.

Maybe one of the space travelers will take  this very copy of Quantum, and another, looking over her shoulder, will read  this article and say to himself: \\\"This Anania from Shirak seems like a pretty  interesting guy. When I get home I'll try to find his problems.\\\"  Good luck, my young friend! Anania is sure to entertain you. Perhaps by then there will be more than n copies of his timeless Problems and Solutions. And  we can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by  Iosef Orbeli.  [1] Vardapet (or vartabed) means teacher or learned man in Armenian. (The     Armenian language suffers in English from a dual transliteration scheme.

(1894-1977)            When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about      Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:                   Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son                of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief                priests and unto the scribes, and they shall                condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him                to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and                to crucify Him; and the third day He shall                rise again\\\" (Matthew 20:18-19).            Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,      who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving      reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He      knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious      leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that      one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual      death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly      how He would die--*by crucifixion.*            All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the      minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted      would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise      again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.            But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-      tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-      tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.            The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth      between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and      ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which      had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against      the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had      predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and      on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the      disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some      of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the      tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,      they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back      to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus' friends, Peter and      John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the      tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came      hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them      to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).            How did this tomb become empty?            One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--      professor of New Testament literature in a large theological      seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*      the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by      bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb      became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the      chimney at Christmas time.            But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down      any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa      Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the      tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.            Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-      bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by      mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.            Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,      tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar      in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)      that the women went to the wrong tomb.            The facts are these:            First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to      which by mistake they could have gone.            Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or      more people to forget the place where they have buried their      dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women      did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to      the wrong tomb?            Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?            There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the      evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.                    Now when they were going, behold, some                of the watch came into the city and showed                unto the chief priests all the things that                were done.  And when they were assembled                with the leaders and had taken counsel, they                gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,                Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole                Him away while we slept.  And if this come to                the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and                secure you.  So they took the money, and did                as they were taught:  and this saying is com-                monly reported among the Jews until this day                (Matthew 28:11-15).            This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the      fact that the tomb was empty.            You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never      questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to      see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.            Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that      the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples      came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*            How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?      Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.            Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject      the explanation, the very character and the later history of the      disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away      the body of Jesus.            First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in      Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to      contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His      resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there      had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,      then proved.            Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would      have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.      It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most      of these men did.            The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ      had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it      would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed      pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing      humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today      as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.            But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to      leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to      what had happened to Him.            Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.            He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning      (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-      18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He      walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that      night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper      room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).            A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at      the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren      on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the      apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-      8).            As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-      ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed      attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are      unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the      unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the      appearances.            Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our      leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are      antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest      thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.      Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;      Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of      Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president      of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.            But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has      it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:      it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.            Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He      claimed to have come down *from* God.            He said He was the way *to* God.            He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.            He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one      else had it.            He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to      us.            Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed      that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*            Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe      that His words are all true?            The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us      that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?            And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead      testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some      day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.            In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all      this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For      He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-      ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a      hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.\",\"#>This happened about a year ago on the Washington DC Beltway. #>Snot nosed drunken kids decided it would be really cool to #>throw huge rocks down on cars from an overpass.

I #>can see boyhood pranks of peeing off of bridges and such, but #>20 pound rocks??!  Has our society really stooped this low??     Yes. Nobody is watching them.  If they get caught, there is no punishment  at all.  In the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping  with a good-sized belt, and then taken into some hospital to see first hand  what kind of damage such accidents cause.   Of course this doesn't happen  any more.  That whipping would probably save the kid's life by teaching  him some respect for others.  A person with that little respect would  inevitably wind up dead early anyway.     The problem is creeping gradualism.  If you put a frog into hot water,  he just jumps out.  But if you put him into cold water and then ever-so-  gradually heat it, the frog will cook.  This is what the entertainment  industry and lack of religious, moral, and educational standards in our  modern North American society have done to us over the years.  Now that  we are about to be 'cooked', we may have woken up too late.  #> #>Erik velapold #  #Society, as we have known it, it coming apart at the seams! The basic reason #is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is #\\\"No Big Deal\\\". Kid's see hundreds on murderous acts on TV, we can abort  #children on demand, and kill the sick and old at will. So why be surprised #when some kids drop 20 lbs rocks and kill people. They don't care because the #message they hear is \\\"Life is Cheap\\\"!    And the education system and the Religious Leaders aren't doing much   about it, either.  With both parents working in this society, where is  the stabilizing influence at home?   Latchkey children are everywhere!  And these latchkey kids can watch whatever rotten videos and listen to  whatever violent hate-promoting \\\"music\\\" and videos they like because no  one is home to stop it.    This day and age, when there is about 100 times more things to learn  than when I went to school, our answer to this increased knowledge is  shorter school hours and more leisure time!  I say keep the kids in  school longer, feed them good food and teach them something, and when  they get home, have a parent there to interact and monitor them.  There  is a very old and now forgotten proverb: a child left on his own will  bring a parent to grief.  Daycare systems are not the answer.  This is  just shifting the parents' own responsibilities off on someone else to  whom it's not a life-long committment, but rather just a job.   #  #AT    Followups should go to alt.parents-teens    Fred W.

I remember seeing an old Nova or The Nature of Things where this idea was touched upon (it might have been some other TV show).  If nothing else, I know such liquids ARE possible because...  They showed a large glass full of this liquid, and put a white mouse (rat?) in it.  Since the liquid was not dense, the mouse would float, so it was held down by tongs clutching its tail.  The thing struggled quite a bit, but it was certainly held down long enough so that it was breathing the liquid.  It never did slow down in its frantic attempts to swim to the top.  Now, this may not have been the most humane of demonstrations, but it certainly shows breathable liquids can be made.\",\"When I use telix (or kermit) in WIN 3.1, or use telix after exiting windows to dos, telix can not find the serial port.

They have not, to my knowledge, announced such a device for the LCII, but they could make one, technologically.  The PDS card that goes to the cage simply needs the NuBus controller circuitry present on NuBus Macs.  Why, though, does anyone care about this? dgr has a three-PDS adapter for the LC/LCII. They will soon have one for the LCIII. PDS is better than NuBus for most people in most applications. Granted, there are more NuBus cards. But, most applications that require a NuBus card (like full-motion video capture) shouldn't be done on an LC/LCII/LCIII

That is it's primary (and I would argue only)   purpose.  To continue to kill people by a practice that has   almost no utility, especially when you know you will be killing   innocents, is unconscionable.    At the very least, the existence of the prison system and our   transportation system are based on their merits to society, not   their detriments.  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent   lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued   existence of these systems.  One has to stretch the evidence and   the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.    Just in case I wasn't clear again:  We maintain a capital   punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with   no net positive gain.  Why?

She reported that she did this on Thursday (3/11), he had a seizure on Saturday and then went 4 weeks without a seizure!!  On Easter he went to Grandma's and ate  candy, pop - anything he wanted.  He had a seizure the next day.  She  sees sensitivity to nutrasweet, sugar, colors, caffine and corn.  With corn she says, he gets very nervous and aggresive.

Her brother, on the other hand, is a junk food addict!  \",\"    The following is from a critique of a \\\"60 Minutes\\\" presentation on MSG    which was aired on November 3rd, 1991.  The critique comes from THE TUFTS    DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...]   \\\"Chances are good that if you watched '60 Minutes' last November  3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In  the segment entitled 'No MSG,' for instance, show host Ed Bradley  makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them  ('millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently  sick'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven  personal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the  substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive   those studies are.   Consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to  a study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order  to back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that MSG,  a flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as  in many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOT  make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on  humans but on rabbits.   One of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist  Patricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that  a small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get   headaches from it.  'But,' she explains, 'the show probably   overemphasized the extent of the problem.'   A second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor  at the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley  remarks, 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory  animals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters' because  it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney's  research with lab animals does not 'show' anything about human  youngsters.   In fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney's   experiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected  extremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing   their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly,  and when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance  to very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither  of those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG   with food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by  enzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little  reaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human  blood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations  found in Dr. Olney's lab animals.....   The World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of  that fact.  And so does the European Communities' Scientific  Committee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies,  have concluded that MSG is safe.   Their determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never  been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed  to it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a  burning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe  of clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently  exonerated the much-maligned substance.   That's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of  monosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever  we eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one  of the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken  down into glutamate during digestion.   It's a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the  most abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes  up about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in  milk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.   That doesn't mean it's entirely unimaginable that a small number  of people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore  sensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, international  professional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensus  reached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large.\\\" \",\"/ hpcc01:rec.motorcycles / cookson@mbunix.mitre.org (Cookson) /  2:02 pm  Apr  2, 1993 /  All right people, this inane bug wibbling is just getting to much.

Blackman, Research Coordinator for NRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89. -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear sir:  By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are drawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of  momentus \\\"scientific\\\" findings. These are regularly released to the press without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings. Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however meaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle serious studies by criminologists.  The latest effort -- \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities,\\\" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying  editorial, \\\"Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,\\\" by two employees of the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular order.   1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to   support the statement that \\\"some have argued that restricting  access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate  of homicide.\\\" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that  contention.    2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very  similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,  demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities  are very different with very different demographic characteristics  which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in  Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white  and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be  the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-  grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various  ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.    3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,  compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all  the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect  in 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-  1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth  involving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM  article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving  handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that  one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding  that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that  a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day  for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without  at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?    4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national  gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily  selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because  it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific  reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which  involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar \\\"control\\\"?  Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite  \\\"scientific\\\" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide  rate *exceeds* that of such \\\"wild west\\\" cities in Texas as  El Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado  Springs. (Ref. 3)    5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or  handguns \\\"are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in  Vancouver.\\\" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending  to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is  an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry  permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in  Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of  handguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun  owners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number  of handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns  for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns  legally for protection, registration figures are  meaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York  City (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,  that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population  in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver  has a greater \\\"prevalence of weapons\\\" than New York City.    The second method of measuring gun density is \\\"Cook's gun  prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity  differences.\\\" But the validation was by Cook of his own  theory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a  different doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is  based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement  in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking  a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide  (42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in  homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in  Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-  ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and  Vancouver.    6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and  Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that  Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to  the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian  law for owning and carrying handguns for personal  protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more  difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually  the case.    7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain  the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the  penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of   clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a  firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number  of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making  arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest  rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences  imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,  or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social  scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,  the authors of the NEJM \\\"tale of two cities\\\" fail even to mention  most factors related to crime control.    8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective  means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not  the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost  650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from  criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the  liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be  completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury  to the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors  reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides  without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle  accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides  involving firearms.    9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the \\\"study,\\\"  editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it \\\"applied  scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb  advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly  handguns.\\\" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly  be mistaken for \\\"scientific methods\\\" by a sociologists or  criminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle \\\"study\\\" is the equivolent  of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding  two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25  and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,  administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while  giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure  and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure,   announcing in a \\\"special article\\\" a new medical breakthrough.  It would be nice to think that such a \\\"study\\\" would neither be  funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.    Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC  make them willing to present shoddy research as \\\"scientific  breakthroughs\\\" in \\\"special articles\\\" and editorials relating  to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying  the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight  over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about  the distortions contained in \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,  and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities\\\" and \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call  for Science.\\\" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside  whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize  an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.

Wright           (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)     suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\\\"  The problem is demonstrated    by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting    to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by    the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal    of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and    suggested that a handgun ban \\\"may reduce the rate of homicide in a     community.\\\"       The nine medical doctors who published \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime,    Assaults, and Homicide\\\" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite    many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver    has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations    make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems    indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period    1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.    Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,    Why?       The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case    to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,    that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their    evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and     unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point    does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support    of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody    knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We    are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that    a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates    when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.       Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two    indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-    weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons    permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the    permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable. *     The second bit of evidence is \\\"Cook's gun prevalence index,\\\" which stands *  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index *  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in  *  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage *  of homicides and suicides involving firearms. *     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides, *  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take *  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be *  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides *  is directly related to their relative availability in the general  *  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To *  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to \\\"prove\\\" it on the basis of *  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.       Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that    guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.    The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun    ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates    reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,    that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.       In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of    violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the     consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin     Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime    for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke    an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.       Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data    on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are \\\"similar in    many ways,\\\" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law    stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish    the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that \\\"all    else is equal\\\" among things being compared. *     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look  *  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime *  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage *  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle *  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent. *  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the *  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half- *  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown *  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out. *     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is *  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates *  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide *  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver. *  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due *  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks, *  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics *  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison *  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial *  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle *  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain *  in either city.       Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the    cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority     groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in \\\"gun availability\\\"    (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not    matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why    blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed    in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,    do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)       Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between    Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have     anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol     abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city    of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the     Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the    United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian    percentage?       The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many    ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent    more detailed analysis, nearly any of these \\\"many ways\\\" might explain part    or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such    as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal. *     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide *  result in a \\\"complex picture.\\\"  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing *  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They *  also acknowledge that \\\"socio-economic status is probably an important *  confounding factor in our comparison,\\\" remarking further that \\\"blacks    *  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of *  Vancouver's population.\\\"  Given the evidence presented in the article, *  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle *  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial *  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility, *  since \\\"detailed information about household incomes according to race *  is not available for Vancouver.\\\"       The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in     gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple    example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms    of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one     would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.    Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce     crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into    account?  In this example, the \\\"hidden variable\\\" is city size: Guns are    more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city    problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the    appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very    seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities    for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,    and their results are impossible to interpret.       In the editorial \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science\\\" accompanying    the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the    authors for applying \\\"scientific methods\\\" to a problem of grave public    heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from    nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate    plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them    out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are    little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this    study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical    identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--    is cause for further concern.

Without delving into a deep discussion of : >>creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code : >>perfect and without flaw.  : >  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~  Do you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and has degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement, shouldn't we?  Perhaps the biggest \\\"imperfection\\\" of the code is that it is full of non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains.  Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that intron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes.   On the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted later, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused, if introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated, since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are conserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and these are not found in or near intron sequences.   I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting \\\"theological arguments\\\" like this.  Try Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish & Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.  : Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does : God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a : theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely : scientific perspective, just different.  Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas  theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.   : I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect, : but that doesn't mean it's perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.  For the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support your assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective, unless you support it by some evidence.  In fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we've thought - for instance, sex might have evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by computer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.)    : Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma : rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.  In fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action.   : Actually, neither of us \\\"knows\\\" what the atmosphere was like at the : time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most : biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after : all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth : was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I : seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for : the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?  I'd replace \\\"created\\\" with \\\"formed\\\", since there is no need to  invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one. Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8 billion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but organic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years. This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve.

I hope you don't forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests  everything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against this conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in  anything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the  right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so, and not to present one's own conclusions prior to this.   Theology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions.  : >>Human DNA, being more \\\"complex\\\", tends to accumulate errors adversely : >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the  : >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in  : >>causing infection and disease.

Bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators from degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to  survive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it  to the present.   And for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection, and thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for either claim.   : But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in : answering John's question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases, : and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require : babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God's fault? (the original : question) -- I say no, it is not.  Of course, nothing \\\"evil\\\" is god's fault.  But your explanation does not work, it fails miserably.   : You may be right.  But the fact is that you don't know that : Satan is not responsible, and neither do I. :  : Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it : be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills : that affect mankind?  I don't think so.  He could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is, it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution.  : Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference. : Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the : point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I : never said that people are \\\"meant\\\" (presumably by God) \\\"to be : punished by getting diseases\\\".  Why I did say is that free moral : choices have attendent consequences.

This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer is not as clear-cut as it seems to be.

This is why we recommend these books.  Is there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence for this? If the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al) suggest, why do people still insist on this?   : Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.

Not much it seems.    It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about. If only those christian \\\"scientists\\\" would take note.  (In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian  scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics.  For example, there are a few chaps who are  trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed  light has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been  accounted for. :-] )   Or (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never  intended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one up?   Millions of people have \\\"died for a lie\\\".  This  point is difficult to  substantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments work in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed  themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.     That is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone) to become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to the claim that Jesus was the \\\"real thing\\\".    Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the point, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based  (I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with  his principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler was sane....      Hmmm.... I don't think his arguments warrant the use of a \\\"Therefore...\\\"   This is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or she will end up in all sorts of shit.     Tony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone,  who thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say \\\"a is equal to b because a is equal to b\\\".

I'am arguing about  : the Armenian-Nazi colaboration during World War II. Any comment?   It could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941,  while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration  camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian  battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had  grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the  cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party  leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by  this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed  and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the  members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of  extermination of the Jews.  This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \\\"encore\\\" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.  Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province of Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia claimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia (around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it had already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who could be expected to oppose their plans.   On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian and military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even  though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over 60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the  British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left  the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few  Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One British soldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring.   Rawlinson wired to his superiors,   \\\"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in  independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops   being without discipline and not being under effective control,  atrocities were constantly being committed.\\\"    Come again?  : \\\"These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...

The Subject:  After-market cruise controls  The Background: I recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five  screws, yuk! :-( ).  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my home) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to drive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of a good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do all the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.  My question: What is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I realize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a thing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of accuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle.  I have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with kettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not electronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying to give information as completly as I can).  I found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system  instead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy this CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?  It has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the  negative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I understand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read it in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but harder to install.  Is there really a big difference?  It has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a sensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which would wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned  the thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it were for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.  The installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal and a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm not sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what exactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it?  I think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative side tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and all that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:   1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a      device?  2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?  3.  Are \\\"professionally\\\" installed CCs signifacantly better and      worth the cabbage?  4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just      that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple       needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,      the questions above)?  My father and I built a \\\"Veep\\\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in high school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and cars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain that I get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my Veep. :-)  I appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  If you would like to share some of your wisdom, please email as I don't get over this group very often (but I check my mail all the time).

Its hard to predicatbaly drift a stock Mustang because of the suspension.   Yes. When i think Mustang, I think school-bus +  F16 motor. In my mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90 or so. It just isn't safe, check out your local junkyard, Mustangs outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in junkyards.  I find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the Mustang for poor brakes in relation to power. Ford should at least standardize on the SVO rear brakes for all 5.0's.     True of Northern Europe, latin countries are something else.  Kindof true. remember they were build by adolf in the '30's.   Yes.   \\\"Autobahn\\\" is the german word for freeway. Other countries have different names for loose equivalents; autostrada, autoroute, motorway etc.   Europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasn't passed as far as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than the US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred to the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things you really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more professional attitude to driving. You just never see two cars running parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.   You're wrong. GTI's  go this fast. Just kind of noisy, not the ideal  autobahn car. A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers foot on the floor. How do I know? - when you're not making any ground on the identical car in front of you!   If something happens at 130-150 you're dead, but the same goes for much over 35. Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. I feel much safer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical US traffic because most people seem to be awake. I've never seen any driver reading a book on an autobahn, I see it all too often in the US.

Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is a *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.  Consider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom of the 13th.  Who won the game?  -Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs. -Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent  defensive plays behind him to do so. -Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and  got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of  the inning.  Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for the win.  How about the offense? -Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either  one, the Sox would have lost in nine. -Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single. -Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first  to third when... -Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning. -Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of  a help, but it was something. -Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the  way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)  Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were credited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit that set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as much as Richardson?  Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than runs.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the game-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with only one out!  Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  You can argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the clutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.  At least OBP and SLG don't *claim* to try to tell you that.

Your fascist government got away with  the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying  the fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away  with the genocide's cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in  Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem  districts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed and hundreds of civilians also perished.     Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included     the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank,    Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives,     children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians     joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan     districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of    3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished    to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to    the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and    seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell    into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims    themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels    also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the    large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from    occupying the city.     The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out    the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the    neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha's nephew alive. They    raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours'    distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them.     At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar,    Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible    atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in    the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the    neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat.     Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the    Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four    villages, including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori,    they continued to spread death and destruction among the    Muslims and other Christian communities, refusing to lay down    their arms.

I have a IIsi that came with a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.   First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum quarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them was stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a problem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for over two months.  The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal hard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard connector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare cable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found in any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of shorts or bad connections.  Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk ribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another male connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again, and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not damaged, and I can go back to the original setup.  Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this day.   In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of the drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are intact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal should be terminated at all the ends.  Let me know if you have any more questions.\",\"I was in the great storm.....my Mazda MPV was damaged so bad they are  going to replace the top, doors and hood.

Also, isn't the point of \\\"professional\\\" hockey to make money for all those involved, which would include the players.  What I think you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as should have been their due, and it is the players that are what make the game great not the people who put them on the ice, so naming division after management people rather than players is adding insult (in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was deserved).   \",\"    Hey, sounds great.

To suggest that AIDS is \\\"deserved\\\" IS ludicrous.  I sin.  I can resolve to abstain from  sin, and do weekly (more often, actually).  Yet I routinely fail. I surely do deserve what I get, yet God compassionately provided  the Incarnate Logos, Jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation. If AIDS is deserved, I surely deserve instant death just as much, as do we all, as St. Paul so cogently remids us.  To willingly judge \\\"others\\\" as deserving punishment seems to me to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.      So what's the point here?  I can get AIDS and NEVER engage in \\\"deviant\\\" sexual behavior.  In fact, I could engage in LOTS of deviant sexual behavior with HIV+ people and never be infected.  AIDS is a consequence of particular behaviors, many of which are not sexual.  And not all sexual behaviors carry the risk of transmission.      The end of all things is to know, love and serve God, growing daily closer through prayer, meditation and discipline.  Even so I could get AIDS.

But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only \\\"real solution\\\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both  legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the \\\"internal nerves\\\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd  always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that \\\"force\\\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.  Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\",\" Pat> In article <SHAFER.93Apr6094402@rigel.dfrf.nasa.gov>   Pat> Gee, I thought the X-15 was Cable controlled.

I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created a colormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the lines in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using XPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay around when the window is refreshed.  Currently, to draw interactively, I begin with:     /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */    /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */    palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;    palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;    palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;    XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);    XFlush( myDisplay);     XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);    XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex);  Then to draw I do:     XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);    XFlush( myDisplay);  And when I'm all done, to return things to normal I do:     XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy);   What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of whatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are over a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.

(818) 354-5011  Contact:  Mary A. Hardin  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993 #1506       Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to measure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.       The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airport reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took measurements as part of a program established to correlate data with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).         The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle Discovery.       \\\"We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an ongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three important ways,\\\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on the balloon research campaign.         \\\"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\\\" he continued.  \\\"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists, and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own right.\\\"       The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring.  Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps scientists construct more accurate computer models which are instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.       The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL instruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere; a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the atmosphere absorbs sunlight.        Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three- hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130 kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground stations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m. Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded to separate from the balloon.       \\\"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared measurements,\\\" Margitan explained, \\\"and we also needed to fly in darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\\\"       It will be several weeks before scientists will have the completed results of their experiments.  They will then forward their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS scientists.           The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon Facility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a contract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was launched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.       The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds and is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.       The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements Program.                        \",\" Nevertheless, DWI is F*ckin serious.

Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren Rychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think Vernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men, as Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King inserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's game. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; no idea how serious - he didn't return.  I still think the Flames should win this series, but they better buckle down.\",\"I installed Windows for Workgroups on my network and I'm having problems  mapping drives in the file-manager.

Lin  \",\"  No matter how \\\"absurd\\\" it is to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a workable moral system created for everyday use.  The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of Israel were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.  It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo- Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was written down by man.  This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers have done).  Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I think the important aspect is the result.

An expert in a field can also predict things based on experience. Beware of predictions like \\\"The volcano will erupt tomorrow!\\\"  Don't follow the preacher because of such statements that come true.  Note also, that if I'm describing a (hypothetical) death of a friend as a result of his passion for fast motorcycles, I might say \\\"his mother predicted he would die.\\\"  Of course, his father may have said \\\"he 'll make good money because of his hobby\\\" and depending upon the final outcome of the situation I end up mentioning the one that's relevant.  A reader down the road will get the impression that the mother or father had predicted accurately the event, when it was just a casual statement.  Finally, on prophesies, note that there are many prophesies that can be fulfilled my people, often to fool believers.  If I say, \\\"Beware, the terminal will unexpectedly be shut off!\\\" and then after 2 secs I turn it off (or have someone come out from another room and do it) there was no prediction.  A similar situation arises with the establishment of the Jewish state.  While pressing for it, prominent Jews argued that it was predicted that they'd have a state again, and that the time has come.  (I've read this somewhere, but can't think of the source - if you can, please let me know.)  In this case, the establishment of the state does not really fulfill the  prophesy since the prophesy was used in order to push for the establishment of the state.  Deciding what was truely a fulfillment of prophesy is very tricky.  -leo \",\"I received the following two notes from Martin Hellman with details on how Clipper will work.  They are posted with his permission.  The implications of some details are fascinating.  ------- Date: Sat, 17 Apr 93 23:05:23 PDT From: \\\"Martin Hellman\\\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu> To: (a long list of recipients) Subject: Clipper Chip   Most of you have seen the announcement in Friday's NY Times, etc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology) announcing the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" crypto device. Several messges on the net have asked for more technical details, and some have been laboring under understandable misunderstandings given the lack of details in the news  articles. So here to help out is your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Friday to get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing details. I was told the info was public, so here it is (the cc of this to Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my facts since I assume he is aware of all this; please let me know if I have anything wrong):  The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in  Silicon. Each chip will have two secret, 80-bit keys. One will be the  same for all chips (ie a system-wide key) and the other will be unit  specific. I don't know what NIST and NSA will call them, but I will  call them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message.  The IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so  that the system key can be kept secret. (Aside: It is clear that  they also want to keep the algorithm secret and, in my opinion,  it may be as much for that as this stated purpose.) The unit key  will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1  and K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow  authorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be  decided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that  they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they  must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased.  When a law enforcement agency gets a court order, they will  present it to these two escrow authorities and receive K1 and  K2, thereby allowing access to the unit key UK.  In addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his  or her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key  plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be  encrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK,  and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part  message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK  producing       E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}  When a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law  enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information  flowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that  they may do this constantly on all links, with or without a  court order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links  over which a message will flow.] This gives the agency access to        E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number  in the above message. They then check the serial number  of the unit and see if it is on the \\\"watch list\\\" for which they  have a court order. If so, they will decrypt E[K; UK] to obtain K,  and then decrypt E[M; K] to obtain M.  I am still in the process of assessing this scheme, so please do  not take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed  scheme. All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme  more knowledgably. But I will say that the need for just one court  order worries me. I would feel more comfortable (though not  necessarily comfortable!) if two separate court orders were  needed, one per escrow authority. While no explanation is needed, the following story adds some color: In researching some ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around, I spoke with Gerald Gunther, the constitutional law expert here at Stanford and he related the following story: When Edward Levi became Pres. Ford's attorney general (right after Watergate), he was visited by an FBI agent asking for \\\"the wiretap authorizations.\\\" When Levy asked for the details so he could review the cases as required by law, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned over 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not comply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear:  No single person or authority should have the power to authorize wiretaps (or worse yet, divulging of personal keys). Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi and sometimes a John Mitchell.

Well, part of the routines I mentioned do a dirty little trick to get around   that problem. First, I create the shared memory segment, attach the client,   attach the X server, and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man   pages on removing of shared memory segments, you will see that the segment   only dies after all attachments are gone.   Now, if the client dies, that's one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you)   and since the X server notices the client has dies, frees up it's resources,   including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment. No more   shared memory segment.   Terrible, but it works.      Regards,\",\"I'm planning on buying a joystick (first time since I sold  my Amiga five years ago :) for a PC.

You are not at position to judge people because you are not civilized enough to give equal rights to your own minorities.

Neil Smith                             WEIRD SCIENCE  Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips  move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are  politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase  \\\"political science\\\" is subject to more than one interpretation.    Years ago, we heard how \\\"scientists\\\" were worried that a new Ice  Age might be coming, and later on that \\\"nuclear winter\\\" -- smoke  and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international  unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even  have killed the dinosaurs.    What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this,  that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended  to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken  values that made America the most successful culture in history,  and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague  when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.    We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William  Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't  supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least  100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never  know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit  their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and  that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.    But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of  science as they are of everything, they trust \\\"scientists\\\" to  unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's \\\"scientists\\\"  have agendas of their own.    Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is  going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that  there is no respectable evidence for \\\"global warming\\\".  The money  and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and  they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical  crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.    The same appears true of \\\"acid rain\\\", a deliberate hoax cooked up  by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private  industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and  foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on  specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.    The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.   \\\"Ozone depletion\\\", for which evidence is even more suspect and  contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than  a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era  when state central planning and the command economy have failed and  can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.    Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth  and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear  power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy  known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount  of energy there is available to any individual in society, the  freer that individual -- and his society -- become.    Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and  self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as  ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive  reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have  been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.    And what the media didn't say about recent EPA \\\"discoveries\\\" on the  effect of \\\"secondhand smoking\\\" is that, although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of  magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a  week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether  there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.    That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically  correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice  to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy  practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's  science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is  highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet  the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There  isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of  government money on the scientific establishment.    Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies  to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one  time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and  religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has  tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of  abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street  -- has wound up being shed.    Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's  lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of  livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate,  to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels  for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates,  when they die from the effects of obesity.    What we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two  more centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of  state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable;  real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will  simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and  everyone will benefit.    L.

For example, the famous 17 mile drive at the Monterrey Peninsula.  And I have stayed at resorts that sported a \\\"No motorcycles allowed\\\" sign at the entrance.  And there have been public places.  Call the AMA and ask for Jim Bensberg (sp?) or any one else in their Legislative Office. They will recound the many public places that they had to bring to court to reverse their ban on bikes.  That includes everything from public parks to full cities.  There are probably a few fights on their books as we now speak.  That is another good reason to donate to their legislative fund. ____________________________________________________________________________    Death is life's way of telling you you've been fired  -- R.

Usually, the line at the bottom of the FileManager (the status bar, I guess) displays the total disk space and the total number of bytes for the current selection.  If I select a whole bunch of files, I will get an exact byte count.  Recently, I notice it incorrectly displays this count; it's truncating! If I select a file that is, say, 532 bytes, it correctly displays '532 bytes'. If I select select a file that is 23,482 bytes, it displays '23 bytes',  not 23 Kbytes, just 23 bytes!  If I select 893,352 it will report only 893 bytes in the selection.  If I select over a Meg worth of files, say 3,356,345 it reports 3 bytes!

This effort will:     o   Use the evolving infrastructure of the U.S. Global Change Research        Program including the Mission To Planet Earth (MTPE) and the Earth        Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Programs.     o   Use the Internet, particularly the High Performance Computing and        Communications Program's NREN (National Research and Education        Network), as a means of providing access to and distribution of        science data and images and value added products.     o   Provide broad access to and utilization of remotely sensed images in        cooperation with other agencies (especially NOAA, EPA, DOE, DEd,        DOI/USGS, and USDA).      o   Support remote sensing image and data users and development        communities.    The user and development communities to be included (but not limited to) as part of this effort are educators, commercial application developers (e.g.,  television weather forecasters), librarians, publishers, agriculture  specialists, transportation, forestry, state and local government planners, and aqua business.   This program will be initiated in 1994.  Your assistance is requested to  identify potential applications of remote sensing images and data.  We would  like your ideas for potential application areas to assist with development of the Implementation Plan.   PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.     We are seeking your ideas in these areas:      (1)  Potential commercial use of remote sensing data and images;      (2)  Potential noncommercial use of remote sensing data and images in         education (especially levels K-12) and other noncommercial areas;     (3)  Types of on-line capabilities and protocols to make the data more         accessible;     (4)  Additional points of contacts for ideas; and      (5)  Addresses and names  from whom to request proposals.

The United States, with its people, have recognized that repression has taken place, with the loss and outright abrogation of civil liberties and constitutional protections of citizens.

With this recognition of repression, at times manifested in the form of collective guilt, I want people to recognize denial.

If, however, the woman is injured or dies, the : *lex talionis* doctrine of \\\"an eye for an eye\\\" applies.

Where the session key is K, and is transmitted encrypted in the unit Key U. Which along with the serial number N is encrypted in the Family key F.  Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The function of this spoof chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the family key   2) Receive Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming integrity of the      law enforcement block is necessary for local operation -      checksums, sequence control, etc.).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  It is probable theere is a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N (34 bits as used in generating U, U1,U2) correctness of the law enforcement block can be determined with only the family key F.  Whereas, no one has proposed Federal Agencies be denied F, and because they could recover it themselves, The correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits of N in E[N; F].  The one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above, but the mutilation could be detected.  A better approach would be to mutilate the entire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption scheme such as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement block can be recovered are lessened.  What do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the serial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmission becomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocol transmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?  One way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the block containing M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.  The goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to  detection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the law enforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original state for use by the clipper chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.  It is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within the clipper chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for, requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting and decrypting E(M; K);  The spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, including on the resulting serial data stream.  Existing clipper products could be subborned.  After all, they are high security encryption systems right?  Super encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without redress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serial number.  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number, which should not be recoverable by other means.  One can see the use of cut outs for procurring clipper phones, or once the number of units is high enough, stealing them.  It would be a mistake on the part of authority, but nice from a point of privacy, if the serial number N were not associated with a particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and  distribution process.  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolen clipper serial numbers N encrypted with F, and the protocols are not  sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream. This could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted stream.  Detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned scheme.  ******************************************************************************  If you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own, and use them in a codebook sustitution with your own, where they point to a valid law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching the remainder of the transmission, you could simply out and out lie, yet deliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement block.   These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators, such as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would require escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.  The M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream and the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key generator synchronized between endpoints.  The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission interception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there's supposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps to the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants an encryption chip with a real time clock?  *****************************************************************************\",\" It would be nice if, as you rightly point out the inherent value of freedom of speech, discussion would also deal with the all-to- frequent ritualized abuses and distortions of that freedom that do  occur.

Sittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly captaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittler's friend) Bobby Clarke.  Instead, Sittler got traded to Detroit.  Rick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and they took the captaincy away from him.  Then he was traded to Chicago.

A:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit     all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in     large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,     Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They     are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.     Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other     jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.  Q:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?  A:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,     but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe     to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.     They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently     available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate     more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.     New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected     by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a     detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned     on.  Q:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?  A:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance     computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target     vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR     system.  Q:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be     able to handle it?   A:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US     in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a     low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the     direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the     radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.     Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low     power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar     detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,     although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such     capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use     is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:     learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they     are used (or else, don't speed.)  Q:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?  A:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.     Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.     Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the     military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the     Federal Communications Commission of the USA.  Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:  Q:  What are understeer and oversteer?  A:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a     car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)     Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to     be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they     tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',     or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)     Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that     untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into     trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle     in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance     oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing     throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle     may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or     spinning.      Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car     will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the     angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling     and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to     travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle     than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater     slip angle than the front wheels.  Q: What is a rev-matched downshift?  A: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear    than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally    you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop    rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle    before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to    the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.  Q: What does heel-and-toe mean?  A: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while    braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot    for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you    use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to    match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;    often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side    on the throttle.     Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the    left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing    the same thing.  Q: What is double-clutch downshifting?  A: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of    three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for    declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the    transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with    rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch    engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission    speed up.     The procedure is as follows:    (0) declutch    (1) move gearshift lever to neutral    (2) engage clutch    (3) match revs    (4) declutch    (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear    (6) engage clutch     This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.    The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the    synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or    with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.    Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at    all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good    condition.  Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and    slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?  A: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and    2) almost never.     In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times    in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the    same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine    that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite    pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from    driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*    major) part of the equation.     Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really    only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically    when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the    comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.    This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads    are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply    of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.     Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the    automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced    by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the    car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making    a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end    of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car    has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'    setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of    caveats could go on for page after page.  Q: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according    to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate    or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?  A: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.     2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics    textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,    none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a    stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating    temperature.     Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser    extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a    substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been    coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match    the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire    at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses    inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling    friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire    is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will    be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its    proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some    part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like    to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.    (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal    street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of    high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)     Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,    it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters    accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than    1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible    for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of    grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques    such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.  Misc. Questions:  Q:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?

A:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and     Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,     which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some     financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may     be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this     is only speculation at this time.\",\" CENTERS [...] [...]  Sanderson will be on Team Canada, but he'd be out of position as a center.

So a \\\"hourglass\\\" cursor should be shown when the application is busy, or a \\\"caution\\\" cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in another. Defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level. So defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain subpart of it, is a rather complicated matter.

I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from  Dennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated at 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to the relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay pins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.  I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube frame used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to do this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two vertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing follows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing. The compressor is about 2\\\" in diameter and about 5\\\" long.  The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small so there should be plenty of good places for it.  I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to mount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side just in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.  The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out about an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look closely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight ahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).  If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try to explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them first.  How do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound more like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock. I have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has not blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).  I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though they know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping the pedestrians on the sidewalk. The bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to those stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives) and are relatively easy to install on the FJ.

One of the advantages and draw-backs of requiring proof on the part of the government before they may take action against citizens.  (and part of the reason some of us believe weapons should be available.)          We are not arguing the absolute sanctity of the U.S. Constitution.  In fact, the fillibuster we're talking about isn't *in* the Constitution.  I objected to your suggestion that the Senate wasn't intended to exercise the power it was clearly given.          I'll point out again that Reagan only had a Republican Majority in the Senate during his first term, and his coalition in the House came apart at about the same time.  Bush never had any real support in Congress.         The real point is that everybody, *everywhere* got their pork, from the big corporations to the guy I saw last night leaving a convenience store with an armful of junk-food he'd bought with food stamps.  (He spent more in food stamps on junk than I *make* in a week and I'm not on government assitance.)          Lessee, let's pull out the old Almanac.         In 1980, total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billion dollars.  In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase of approx. 884 billion dollars.         In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars.  In 192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars. That leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccounted for.  (This represented an increase of 230%)         In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs, Housing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare) cost 86.5 billion dollars.  In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, or more than national defense started.  (This represented an increase of 230%)         In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars on Medicare.  In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars.  (an increase of 368%)         In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housing credits and subsidies of that like.  In 1992 it was 87 billion.         In 1980, Health care services and research was 23 billion dollars.  In 1992, it was 94 billion dollars.         Agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion.         Science, up 11 billion to 16 billion.         Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion.         Education up 14 billion to 45 billion.         Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion.         Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion.              About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under  the Energy category, primarily under \\\"Supply,\\\" and \\\"Community Development,\\\" in the area of \\\"disaster relief,\\\" and between the two of them represent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars.         Where *was* this huge diversion?          Not that's a stretch.  If the current government was pushed by the President to create this mess, wouldn't one expect it to begin to equalize once the pressure is gone?          Only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want to continue. I see very little positive about it.          The Constitution was *designed* to frustrate the democratic process, so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting what they wanted by the time it happened.  Nor do I see putting the brakes on the \\\"democratic process\\\" an inherently bad thing.  Califronia's riding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense it gets worse.

When Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 1948, the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visit religious shrines.  This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan, who did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control.  The Jordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city.  They turned a Jewish cemetary into a hotel, and used the gravestones in their latrines.

Even if we assume that these \\\"trusted agents\\\" are really entering  a wide range of S1 and S2 seeds (rather than using the same one all the  time to reduce the key search space to 30 bits), I assume they are not  doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry  at carefully selected points to encode data.  They would presumably be  punching numbers into a computer, which for all they know could program  the chips in a manner completely independent of the S1 and S2 values they  are feeding into the system.  S1 and S2 are clearly the backdoor - we should assume they are all compromised.  If they're not compromisable, why the hell not use a hardware true random number source.  There isn't a random number source *anywhere* in this proposal.  The whole thing is deterministic from the day the serial number is stamped on the chip.  Nope, it can't be trusted.  This is all about two levels of access - the (possibly honest) key escrow that police forces have to use, and ostensibly the FBI; and the back door that lets the NSA decode *everything* on the fly - and maybe some back-handers to the FBI when they want a warrantless tab in exchange for favours.\",\": I've started to look at some devices doing serial data transmission : over fairly decent distances in fairly noisy environments, and have : seen a variety of schemes for protecting the RS232 transceivers (and : the rest of the circuit) from transients on the serial lines.

How necessary is : it? : [stuff deleted] : What is the wisdom on this out there? :  : Ta, :  : Martin. :  :  From what I know, protection is necessary, esp. if you plan to route the cables into an unknown environment (out of your control).

They have several RS232 transceivers that have overvoltage protection. Among them include the LT1080, LT1081 and MAX250 and MAX251.

This disease is  universally and usually rapidly fatal.  After diagnosis in June 1992, the  tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy.  The forum  member checked extensively on Dr. Burzynki's track record for this disease.   He spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from  glioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had  audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive.   After the forum member's father began Dr. Burzynski's treatment in  September, all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his  oncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of  shrinkage or necrosis.  The patient's oncologist, although telling him he would probably not live  past December 1992, was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr. Burzynski's  treatment.  Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Dr. Burzynski's  treatment, she's since changed her attitude toward continuing these  treatments, saying \\\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\\"  Dr. Burzynski is an M.D., Ph.D. with a research background who found a  protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients, synthesized it,  and administers it to patients with certain cancer types.

In so doing, they eventually come to a point where they have a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace the system.

Perhaps there are some offshoots of Islam that impose this on their followers.  But the standard tithe is 1/40 of one's net worth, once a year.  The same writer also objects to the Bible for teaching that   > \\\"woman was created after man, to be his helper\\\" etc.  This is presumably a reference to Genesis 2. Suppose that that chapter had been written with the sexes reversed. We have God creating woman, and then saying, \\\"It is not good that woman should be alone. I will make a help meet for her.\\\" Feminists would be outraged. The clear implication would be that God had started at the bottom and worked up, making first the plants, then the fish and birds, then the beasts, then woman, and finally His masterpiece, the Male Chauvinist Pig. The statement that woman is not capable of functioning by herself, that she needs a man to open doors for her, would have been seen as a particularly gratuitous insult. The fact that the creation of woman from the dust of the ground was given only briefly and in general, while the creation of the Man was given in six times the number of words, would have been cited as evidence of the author's estimate of the relative importance of the sexes. The verdict would have been unequivocal. \\\"No self-respecting woman can accept this book as a moral guide, or as anything but sexist trash!\\\" I suggest that Moses, fearing this reaction, altered his original draft and described the creation with Adam first and then Eve, so as to appease Miriam and other radical feminists of the day. For some reason, however, it did not work.\",\"Would someone please give me the address for Texas Ranger ticket orders. Thanks very much.\",\"  i'm sorry, as i have never heard of any of this.

I think I have a problem with the stereo sound output on my Quadra 900, but I am not totally sure because my roomate has the same problem on his PowerBook 170.  Any info or experience anyopne has would be greatly appreciated.  When I hook my Quadra up to my home stereo system, the following types of sounds (mono, as far as I can tell) all play fine through BOTH speakers:  system beeps  (already provided ones such as Indigo and ones I record)  Armor Alley Spectre Spaceward Ho!   But, the following games only play out of the left channel:  Lemmings Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW) Glider 4.0 OIDS   But still, STEREO system beeps do play in stereo, through BOTH speakers. (The one I'm specifically referrring to is Apocolyptic Beginning, which my roommate downloaded from some ftp site (sumex?))   All of the symptoms are the same on my rommates 170 (he can't run OOTW because he doesn't have color).  We're both running system 7.1    Does anyone with Lemmings or the other three games I mentioned above get sound out of both speakers on a Mac II class, Quadra, LC, PowerBook 140 or greater, Centris, SE/30, etc... (stereo) machine?  I used to have a Mac II, and I sort of rememeber Lemmings playing in stereo on that machine, not just on the left channel.  (I could be mistaken, though.  If there were a problem with the Quad 900's and PB 170's, I am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo?  If there isn't a problem with our machines, I wonder why the 4 games above are apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of both speakers  (like Spectre, etc. do)?  Quadra 900's and PowerBook 170's have the same ROMS (to my knowledge), so maybe this is a ROM problem?  (if so, though, why wouldn't System 7.1 patch over this problem?)

I was walking down the streets on our campus, and a beggar came up and asked me for any spare change I might have.  I had a dollar or so that I gave her, and - not wanting to give away all my money to strangers (I generally give a dollar as that will buy a little food at McDonalds or something) - I offered her some \\\"spiritual gifts,\\\" as I called them, rather than gifts of money. I talked of how great I felt that God had made such a pretty day, and how nice it was to give to people - she then said she was getting married soon. She talked about how she and her husband had very little (they may not have even had a house, for all I know), but that they felt a very special love in the Lord, an unselfish kind of caring.  It warmed my heart to know that 2 people can have so little monetarily, and realize that spiritually they are indeed very rich.  A good lesson for all of us who say we want more, more, more; what we really need cannot be counted, or sold, or bought.\",\"   The Honda ST1100 was designed by Honda in Germany, originally for the  European market, as competition for the BMW 'K' series.

That you know of.  While I lived in the DBR, a gang robbed a joint US Army/Bundewehr armoury and got several hundred M-16s, ammunition, handguns and some explosives.  When I left two years later, there were no clues.   Who uses them is the problem.  Crime, in the U.S., is \\\"no big deal\\\" if you are the criminal.  How about 5 years for murder.  Credit for time served (in jail, waiting for trial) and you are out in 12 months, worst case.  If we would put criminals, especially violent ones, in the slam for true sentences, crime would drop.  Instead, we reward them for being good and let them out early, very early.   Serbs, Croats and Muslims have been killing each other almost since before the invention of guns.  Old women are throwing stones at UN trucks.  This is a hatred that goes beyond reason.  Yes, the problem is the user.  Question back (since you are one of the rational ones):  If all gun crime were to stop, would you support dropping all gun controls?   They did not believe, from experience, that the \\\"police\\\" (including National Guard) could/would protect them.  Unless you want to argue that a human being does not have a right to protect him/herself, they did the right thing.  What would you suggest as a defense against a mob throwing bottles and rocks, and also likely armed with stolen firearms?   Criminals would move to Scandinavia??? :-)  The average criminal would look for a less hazardous job, and the rest would likely be buried at county expense.   Personally, I criticize the fools who send money to the IRA to \\\"make Ireland free\\\".  Of course, this is the last thing the IRA wants, because they lose power if England pulls out.

Hooligan is a word never used when reffering to sports fans here.  I guess that's where the different cultures thing comes in.   Yes.  The question is, is the problem one of too many guns (mostly from the army) or not enough (nonSerbians can not defend themselves.   But disarming responsible gun owners is not the solution.

As for 'war' I am not sure how I would define it. If you just look at attacks on villages then there is no way of deciding when it started. Would you count the riots in the 20's and 30's? Violence but not war. I personally think that 'war', as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever, requires organisation, planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces. Perhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts. I could easily be convinced it was so. From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone organisation. The Haganah and Palmach certainly did. That is not a cause for criticism, it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the 'Zionist' camp.   Now you are being silly aren't you? In any case the war did NOT start with the invasion of the Arab Armies. You see we both agree on something. And the previous posters were wrong, no?   Again I am not sure, I doubt you want my opinion anyway, but I think war requires organisation as I said before. It needs a group to command and plan. If Fatah lauches rockets from Southern Lebanon (and are you sure you have the right group - not the Moslems again?) then that sounds like war to me. Stone throwing does not.

I saw him play in the Swedish championship  game for junior players this year, and he played very well, a physical game,  but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie does (I suspect you would like to  have a Ulf type-of-player on the B's team too? :)  As for Mariusz Czerkawski, he has had a *great* season for Hammarby in  division 1. He scored -if I remember correctly- 93 points this season,  and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in Sweden is  considered *very good* due to the limited number of games. Mariusz is  Djurgarden property (he was just on loan to Hammarby), so he will play  in Elitserien next season, unless the B's can get him of course.  I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to  watch in Swedish hockey this season.

TRANSLATION   The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self.                                    PURPORT   All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the beginning of transcendental life.   As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.  Bhagavad-Gita As It is Books of A.C.

That was their argument to prove that you don't go wrong buying the Ford Taurus over the Camry.   Now, if I remember correctly, the Camry costs about $4000 or so more in initial costs.  Essentially, it means that you spend about $4000 extra on repairs on the Taurus.  That is ridiculous.  Every time your car needs repairs, it is extra hassles, loss of time and a dozen other things.

The bible was written by some male chavnist thousands of years ago (as were all of the \\\"holy\\\" books). Follow the parts that you think are suitable for modern life. Ignore the others. For heaven's (!) sake don't take it literally.      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   So you think it is easy to be a Muslim? Or be a Buddhist? The Buddha's commandments are 500 yrs older than Christ's and in my opinion tougher to follow. Moreover the Buddha says that we are  intrinsically good (as against Christ's \\\"we are all sinners\\\").  Only we allow ourselves to be distracted. By meditating we can awaken  ourselves (etc etc). Also there is no concept of God in Buddhism.  (In my opinion you can be an Atheist and a Buddhist). But to \\\"awaken\\\" yourself is no easy task. Can you stay away from eating meat? Can you sit still and think of nothing (meditate) for sometime everyday? Buddhists do (or are supposed to). Can you pray five times a day?  Can you fast for a month every year (Ramzan). Are you willing to give 1/6 th of your income as tithe? Muslims do. In fact I think  Jesus was an ordinary man (just as Buddha and Mohamed) probably with a  philosopy ahead of the times (where he lived).  Considering the fact that Christianity is a young religion (compared to Hindiusm, Judaism, Zorasterism, Buddihsm) it is also very probable that the Bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideas. (There was a good deal of trade between the eastern lands and the middle east at the time of Christ). And perhaps some more. But leave the crap in it out (\\\"woman was created after man, to be his helper\\\" etc). aras       When ever I turn on my TV there is this Pat Robertson and other brain washers (Oh boy, what an act they put on!) with an 1-800 number to turn in your pledges.

It gives the nicest outputs, with only a minor loss of quality.   For all intensive purposes (papers, letters, resumes), I treat my Deskjet like a laser printer (You *do* have to look a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters).  Only one grudge, the ink that HP gives you does smudge rather quickly in the presence of moisture (Even though the ink is waterproof).  However, you would have to spend about $500 more for laser quality.  The cannon bubblejets are nice, however they don't seem to have as much support (eg: drivers for popular programs) as the HP ink-jets. Also HP Deskjet (regular,plus,500,500c) accepts xerox paper (I believe that the cut-sheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet).  If you don't mind refilling your printer with cheap ink (say fountain-pen ink), then the HP deskjets are *very* cheap to maintain (I paid $3.50 for my last bottle of ink and I expect it to last 9 months).    -Kimball (who doesn't work for HP, but just loves his printer     very much!)\",\"  I think the passage you're looking for is the following.  Matthew 5:17    \\\"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the  prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them.  Matthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away,  not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.  Matthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments  and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he  who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of  heaven.  Matthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of  the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.   There are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  This is a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to. (A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded in Acts 15.)  However there's more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.  Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed. For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.  While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law.  The \\\"not an iota or dot\\\" would suggest a rather literal reading, but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the \\\"ceremonial law\\\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards.  The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish ceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much trouble.\",\"The actual algorithm is classified, however, their main thrust here is for cellular phones, and encryption is only over the radio end, not end to end, I think.

There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.

Final Solution for the Gaza ghetto ? ------------------------------------  While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto, they repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and attempt to starve the Gazans.  The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world, has been cut off from the world for weeks. The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the strip and seek work in Israel.  While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help the Gazan resistance. The only help given to Gazans by Israeli Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.  The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of justice. A population denied basic human rights is entitled to rise up against its tormentors.  As is known, the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel, although they are considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels, shops and fields. Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in Israel. They may not live there, for these areas are reserved for the Master Race.  The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the right to self- administration.  They selected Jews to pacify the occupied population and preventing any form of resistance. Some Jewish collaborators were killed. Israel also wishes to rule over Gaza through Arab collaborators.  As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible with basic human rights and international law, that of becoming Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for self-determination, it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish society does not consider Gazans full human beings. This attitude is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews. The current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister Yitzhak Rabin that 'Gaza sink into the sea'. One is led to ask oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister goals towards the Gazans ? Whether they have some Final Solution up their sleeve ?  I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever they can to help the Gazans regain their full human, civil and political rights, to which they are entitled as human beings.

The two statements following ARE consistent:  (1) I do not believe that you are wearing lilac socks (2) I do not believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks  The two statements following are NOT consistent:  (3) I do believe that you are wearing lilac socks (4) I do believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks  Statements (1) and (2) require no faith, they make no presumptions about the nature of reality.  Statements (3) and (4) require belief.  Many atheists (myself included) take the following position:  (5) I do not believe that there is a god. (6) I do not believe that there is not a god.\",\"Do you or does anyone you know have a wrecked 1981 or later R80(anything) or R100(anything) that they are interested in getting rid of?

The specific recommandation cited in the Hurt study was that a formal \\\"street strategy\\\", like SIPDE for example, was the most important component of any rider education curriculum.  The specific skills of emergency braking, cornering and swerving must be taught and practiced as well, but more significant was that 35% of rider did NOTHING confronted with a potential accident, and another third collided or fell over as a result of rider error.  The choice of specific maneuver is much less significant to the outcome than early detection and the proper execution of ANY effective countermeasure.\",\"Well, it looks like I'm F*cked for insurance.

Any documentation for VESA standard?  2. At a higher resolution than 320x200x256 or 640x480x16 VGA mode,    where the video memory A0000-AFFFF is no longer sufficient to hold    all info, what is the trick to do fast image manipulation?  I    heard about memory mapping or video memory bank switching but know    nothing on how it is implemented.   Any advice, anyone?    3. My interest is in 640x480x256 mode.  Should this mode be called    SVGA mode?  What is the technique for fast image scrolling for the    above mode?  How to deal with different SVGA cards?     Your guidance to books or any other sources to the above questions would be greatly appreciated.  Please send me mail.

I am a divorced father. Chance would have it that \\\"my weekend\\\" with my  daughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.  Although I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decided that the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith was too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a date), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.  During the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church.   When our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she  be baptised as Catholic. This wasn't a problem with me.  During a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease that affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward for two months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated \\\"effectively\\\".  In other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.  During the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over my daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday visitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study books to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.  Last fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings. At that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time, I started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend. I did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a religious community.  Today, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for  Communion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine (The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the pew in front of us.  I feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her religious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments if you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.  My daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and mature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly for religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with my daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.  My initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith in Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays with her again.  I do not want to \\\"drive her from the fold\\\", and would be willing to allow her to continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only for two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.  Any suggestions?  If you have a response, please e-mail me a copy. (I'm not a regular reader of this newsgroup.) (Naturally, feel free to post too!)  Thanks, and I hope you've had a happy Easter.

Thanks,  Tom Ostrand \",\"  Well, I've said that when an innocent person has been executed, this is objectively a murder.  However, who is at blame is another question. It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions-- realizing the risks--is to blame.   Yes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this.   And I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact, many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents.   But, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals on the road.  Again, the blame is on society.   Yes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do so much to prevent false witnesses.   Okay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not all such \\\"murders\\\" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong, no matter what the circumstances?   But, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of society shares this blame.  And, most people's definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an execution, is it?   Murder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing it at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim is.   Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth matters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That is, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.   But then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the conviction was unfair.   Yes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all possible information), we can't always determine the difference in our flawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible, but it still isn't objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn't matter if we *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.   But what we know has no effect on an objective system.   Why are you so sure?   Why is *your* reality important?   But, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely. And, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective system.   Well, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal. We can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible.   Yes, we all bear the responsibility.  Most people seem willing to do this.   We must realize the consequences of all our actions.  Why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack?   I don't think our country has an objective system, but I think such an objective system can exist, in theory.  Without omniscience, an objective system is not possible in practice.\",\"The real problem w/ the Stealth from what I've heard is that Diamond won't tell anyone how to program their proprietary clock stuff, so X under Linux and 386BSD won't run.... \",\"We're about ready to take a bold step into the 90s around here by accelerating our rather large collection of stock MacPlus computers.

A net-contact in L.A. tells me that the alert will remain over this weekend, as some elements may find excuse over the not-guilty verdicts on three of five charges (the aiding-and-abetting).  Those acquittals seem to balance out the fact that Rodney King himself was not any kind of angel that night, speeding and fleeing et al.  However ...  Another consideration is any street celebrations over the two convictions on the excessive force charges (Koons for incompetance, and Powell for overreacting --- both guilty as heck even from the view of NYPD cops interviewed) that might get out of hand. )-;  Also, some elements may take the acquittals as an excuse to challenge the cops (a dumb move, obviously).  And, Koreans are still scared and certain people are really mad over how they have armed themselves in the last year.

Because his messengership is universal, he has been distinguished by  miracles that relate to almost all species of creation.     Just as the supreme aide of a renowned ruler, arriving with many gifts in a city where various people live, will be welcomed by a representative of each people who acclaims him and bids him welcome in his own language so, too, when the supreme messenger of the Monarch of Pre- and  Post-Eternity  (Ezel and Ebed  Sultani) honored the universe by coming as an envoy to the inhabitants of the earth, and brought with him the light of truth and spiritual gifts sent by the Creator of the universe and derived from the realities of the whole universe, each species of creation -from water, rocks, trees, animals and human beings to the moon, sun and stars- welcomed him and acclaimed his prophethood, each in its own language, and each bearing one of his miracles.     Now it would require a voluminous work to mention all his miracles.  As the punctilious scholars have written many volumes concerning the proofs of His prophethood, here we will briefly point out only the general category into which fall fhe miracles that are definite and accepted as accurate reports.     The evidences of the prophethood of Muhammad (SAW) fall into two main categories:        The first is called irhasat and includes the paranormal  events that happened at the time of his birth, or before his  declaration of prophethood.        The second group pertains to all the remaining evidences  of the prophethood, and contains two subdivisions:       1) Those wonders that were manifested after his departure from this world in order to confirm his prophethood, and   2) Those that he exhibited during the era of his prophethood.  The latter has also two parts:    2.1) The evidences of his prophethood that became manifest in his own personality, his inner and outer being, his moral conduct and perfection, and      2.2) The miracles that: related to substantial matters.   The last part again has two branches:    2.2.1) Those concerning the Qur'an and spirituality, and   2.2.2) Those relating to matter and creation.  This last  branch is again divided into two categories:    2.2.2.1) The first involves the paranormal happenings  that occured during his mission either to break the  stubbornness of the unbelievers, or to augment the faith of the belivers.  This category has twenty different sorts, such as the splitting of the moon, the flowing of water from the fingers, the satisfying of large numbers with a little food, and the speaking of trees, rocks and animals Each of these sons has also many instances, and thus has, in meaning, the strength of confirmation by consensus.    2.2.2.2)  As for the second category, this includes events lying in the future that occured as he had predicted upon Allah (SWT)'s instructions.  Now starting from the last category, we will summarize a list of them.(1)  (1) Unfonunately, I could not write as I had intended without choice, I wrote as my head dictated, and I could not completely conform to the order of this classification. \",\" :  Nice cop out bill.

We wanted to talk to the internet with the mail package so we got the smtp gateway.  You also need a tcp/ip transport package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that's what they require to get the smtp gateway to work.  You need a dedicated pc for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff.  We do not have the remote mail going but you indicate that that is what you want to do.    There is a glitch somewhere in the system though.  I don't know if it is MS mail, the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent.  The scenario is this.  The outgoing mail goes to a Unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go.  If that mail is routed to the VAX, the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail. Most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the VAX forwarded to some other location.  That is the main gotcha. Where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying \\\"Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)\\\".  If you can stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok.  The system people of course say that the VAX is not the problem, the gateway is probably the problem.  If anyone wants to get help it is only $175.00 for one support call.

(And I'm not entirely joking about  those two names)  I'm really not entirely sure I trust EFF any more to be honest.  Anyway, any organisation can be deeply infiltrated.  Look at CND in Britain a dozen years ago - one of their top members was an SIS spy who stole their complete address list.

I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU is essentially a group of auditors: they audit how people's civil liberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to get involved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good reason.  When I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the auditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a security point of view, but wouldn't tell us how to fix it.  I always figured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix the problem.  Then I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason. Auditors don't like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a bad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The auditee can say, \\\"Well, you told us this way would be OK.\\\"  It compromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor's job.  Taking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar. Suppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU's part, a key half gets away that shouldn't, and is used to deprive someone of her civil liberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court. But they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant and of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.  There are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one place where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed automatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum was kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and was brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.  I believe the difference between this situation and the key registration situation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll checks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again today, he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they can be destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are legit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could put the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU conflict of interest.  As always, my opinions are my own.\",\"The Bmw speedo is triggered by a reed switch\\\\magnet assembly in the differential.

I'm writing a program to convert .dxf files to a database format used by a 3D graphics program I've written.  My program stores the points of a polygon in CCW order.  I've used 3D Concepts a  little and it seems that the points are stored in the order they are drawn.  Does the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the  points are stored in, CW or CCW?  Its easy enough to convert, but if I don't know which way they are stored, I dont know  which direction the polygon should be visible from.  If DXF doesn't handle this, can anyone recommend a workaround? The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one in the DXF file, one stored CW and the other CCW.  But that doubles the number of polygons and decreases speed...  Thanks in advance for any help,\",\"  : I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of : the world  if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group : of the population.   I've been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties with Christianity. It is surprising to note that a large majority of people, at least in Finland, seem to be apatheists - even though 90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland, religious people are actually a minority.   Could it be possible that many people believe in god \\\"just in case\\\"? It seems people do not want to seek the truth; they fall prey to Pascal's Wager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believe reads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn't care - it believes, but doesn't know what or how.   People don't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle, they only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say that they are not \\\"born in the Spirit\\\", but this does not disturb them. Religion is not something to think about.   I'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless -  a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to. Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop, too many people take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow (and unconsciously hope god wouldn't notice ;-) )  : Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a : higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The : typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the : same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the : other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn : somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core, : than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it : expresses its own selfishness.  If logic and reason are valued, then I would claim that atheistic thinking is of higher value than the theistic exposition. Theists make unnecessary assumptions they believe in - I've yet to see good reasons to believe in gods, or to take a leap of faith at all. A revelation would do.  However, why do we value logic and reasoning? This questions bears some resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science: why mathematics works? Strong deep structuralists, like Atkins, have proposed that perhaps, after all, everything _is_ mathematics.   Is usefulness any criterion?  Petri \",\"Hello netters!  I'm visiting the US (I'm from Sweden) in August. I will probably rent a Chevy Beretta from Alamo. I've been quoted $225 for a week/ $54 for additional days.

My 2 cents worth:  The speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker.  A speaker being a coil, it's bidirectional and makes no difference which way you attach.  Turbo switch.   There are three wires to control how you want turbo to become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I think the middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in, and which two wires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriate two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard.  LED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending which way the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard, if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the board, the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboard is like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn't light, power off, reverse the connectors and try again.   It should work.  If it does, then attach the turbo switch to the board.  Hope this helps.\",\"I can tell you that when AMSAT launched some birds along a Spot satellite (French), that during installation of some instruments on Spot 2, there heavily armed legionaires who had a `take no prisoners' look on there faces. Spot satellites are completely capable of doing some very good on orbit surveillance.  BMc --\",\" Do you mean the icons _of_ the program groups, or the icons of the individual programs _in_ the program groups?  I assume you mean the latter, and the answer is: sure you can.  Just click once (not double) on the application icon, then Alt-F P (File | Properties).  Click on the Change Icon box and tell it the icon filename.  Or use the Browse sub-selection.   I use Alt-Tab.  Hold the Alt key and repeatedly press Tab until you see Program Mangler up.  Then release the Alt key.  \",\" The only time I've seen similar behaviour is when an X application forked a child without setting close on exec on the X display connection file descriptor. The shell waited for a ConfigureNotify event that never arrived because it got picked up by the child.  Sometimes the shell correctly got the ConfigureNotify if the timing was 'right'. \",\"Maine beat LSSU 5-4.  \",\" And that, of course, is the point.   You can't simply divide the world into atheists and non-atheists on the basis of god-belief.  If all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity, and have nothing to say about behaviour, then belief in a supernatural being is your criterion.  But once you start talking about behaviour, then someone's suscept- ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you  are - I assume - worried about.  And in that area, what you care about is whether someone is sceptical, critical and autonomous on the one hand, or gullible, excitable and easily led on the other.  I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates that a person is easily led.   Whether they have a worship or belief  in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be beside the point.\",\"     Yow - get some sleep Brad!  You mean that people (i.e. life-is-cheap terrorists & drug-dealing warlords) who want to communicate in privacy will prefer to break into my house, kill or kidnap me, and steal my telephone, rather than:          - Spending $15 at K-mart to buy a new phone.          - Purchasing a load of phones from the black market / flea market /           super market.          - Talking (*gasp*) face-to-face.          - Walking down to any one of millions of pay phones.          - Using messengers.          - Going to excruciating effort to think of code phrases like \\\"I had           a blowout on the freeway today\\\".      Look, this system does nothing to threaten folks who _know_ they're being wiretapped, since it's trivial to find other avenues of communication; they'd have no reason to resort to extreme measures, since a plethora of simple alternatives are easily available to them.      Among all the legitimate reasons to damn the proposed system, I don't think we need to worry about terrorist commie drug warlord assasin thugs murdering our families, kicking the dog and leaving the toilet seat up just to steal a $15 telephone.  The system is more like urine testing:  it catches some small number of very stupid people, has no effect on the \\\"bad guys\\\" with at least three neurons working in unison who wish to subvert it, and penalizes most heavily those who have no cause to be subject to it.\",\"  Sorry, but it is *virtually* impossible to win a division with \\\"no talent\\\" over 162 games.  I would amend your definition to:  underdog:  a team expected to lose, but which wins thanks to underestimated            talent.\",\"Hi, anyone have the latest drivers for the Actix Graphics Accelerator Card?

Madness.  /* Written  4:34 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */ /* ---------- \\\"From Israeli press. Madness.\\\" ---------- */ FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.  Paper: Zman Tel Aviv (Tel Aviv's time). Friday local Tel Aviv's paper, affiliated with Maariv.  Date: 19 February 1993  Journalist: Guy Ehrlich  Subject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan (Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate within the occupied territories.  Excerpts from the article:  \\\"A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as Arabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is that everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one way or another insane\\\".  A man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name is known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be called Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to depart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different from average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service. But in their souls, one can notice something completely different....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them. And they think that to most of their fellows from the Cherry it woundn't be easy either. Yet after they began to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking. The following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness.  (...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in which some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We called such soldiers H.I. 'Hit by the Intifada'. Under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common phenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I should talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On Fridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to until I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The keys of my father's car must be ready for in advance, so that I can go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don't want them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it instantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only there I become normal.(...)  (...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother. It was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how exactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began to laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh straight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov cocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as they deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with the effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I was delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the Arab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit him straight in his ass. We both felt that we'd pulled off something.  Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab, blood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: 'Shut up' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed straight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at something convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: 'All right, wait a moment'. I left him in order to take a look at another wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be saved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all this to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight into my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt I was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over her head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn't know what to say.  (...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a field. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend shot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the hill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it. We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two deer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully inspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We had hit'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too, so as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like beasts of prey. We couldn't explain what had happened to us. We were almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we felt the whole day very badly.  (...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in. This is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may be for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel Godlike of sorts.\\\"  (...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any security-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. 'Why shouldn't I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ? Why shouldn't I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver while being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suits me perfectly. I have no human emotions any more. If I get a reasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to Bosnia in order to fight there.\\\"\",\"Dave Kingman is Jewish\",\"The Harvard Computer Society is pleased to announce its third lecture of the spring.

Phil    ------- Forwarded Message  Subject: text of White House announcement and Q&As on clipper chip encryption  Note:  This file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and via the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.      ---------------------------------------------------                           THE WHITE HOUSE                    Office of the Press Secretary  _________________________________________________________________  For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993                   STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY   The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?\",\"I am very interested in investigations of starvation for improving health.

More along the lines of Hebrews 12:25-29, I reckon...   See that you refuse not him that speaks. For if they  escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much   more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that   speaks from heaven:   Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he has promised,  saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also  heaven.   And this word, Yet once more, signifies the removing of  those things that are shaken, as of things that are made,  that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.   Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved,   let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably   with reverence and godly fear:   For our God is a consuming fire.   Or 2nd Thessalonians 1:7-10...   And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord  Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,   In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God,  and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:   Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from   the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;   When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be  admired in all them that believe (because our testimony   among you was believed) in that day.

Somehow it seems to also apply to the entire physical world as  we know it. LF suggests that God doesn't want that and has sent Koresh  as a reminder.   Seems that those who have been purified through salvation, or that those protected by the Seals, will be the ones who survive. And no -- I don't  have a good idea yet what \\\"being shielded by the seals\\\" actually involves  or how exactly it relates to salvation. (Other than it involves the marriage of the Bridegroom and the Bride... for those of you Biblical well versed.)         - < > -  Me personally, I'm totally 100% dependent on God through Christ, so  if God wants me to understand, good. If not, also good. If God wants to save me, or dispose of me, that's great either way. Being born in the Spirit, means being part of the Body of Christ (Ephesians 2), so who and what I was, matters little. * What's important is loving GOD *  Come Nova, Nuke, or Apocalypse -- who cares?

Not worth fearing or  worrying about though, not before:        -* The Greater Glory of GOD *-     Maybe Koresh is right, maybe he isn't, and it should be interesting to  see the new message (or prophecy). The tour of the Bible I've taken in  studying the passages he points to in the 3-02 text, has been most re- warding. But the test of prophecy is still the fruit it bears -- which  is not yet clear.   Much much more important is \\\"Charity\\\" -- which by definition *is* --                      Love for GOD  (I hope Dear Reader, you've taken all this as an expression of faith,   and not a statement of mere fact.

Jim -- jmd@handheld.com\",\"From the article \\\"What's New\\\" Apr-16-93 in sci.physics.research:  ........ WHAT'S NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC  1. SPACE BILLBOARDS! IS THIS ONE THE \\\"SPINOFFS\\\" WE WERE PROMISED? In 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published \\\"The Man Who Sold the Moon,\\\" which involved a dispute over the sale of rights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this  hideous vision of the future.  Observers were startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the pad with \\\"SCHWARZENEGGER\\\" painted in huge block letters on the side of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged for the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie. Now, Space Marketing is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth orbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However, since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates (WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This may look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of Space Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the project is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozone monitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs. ..........  What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize the night sky? It is not even April 1 anymore. What about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else that it might even be visible during the day, leave alone at night). Is NASA really supporting this junk? Are protesting groups being organized in the States? Really, really depressed.               Enzo\",\" From the limited details released so far, It seems that the clipper chip  system must employ some sort of public key cryptography. Otherwise, the key  management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system  unworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place at the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in  their data base?  This means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key  algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is  rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the feds are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that  could break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.     As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to ban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. Their contention that they  need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likely is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont  have the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q&A session, they talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed. They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without  court order even though tapping a phone line requires one. Also pick up on  their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we'll ban strong crypto outright? I dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all (legal) ways possible.\",\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis   Dear Josh  I appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions.  Having said that, I am not totally happy with your answers.  1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards identify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S. citizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are just trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic country where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or religious identity to any public official who so requests ?  2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all kinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy. You did not respond to my question.  3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is interesting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear weapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ?  4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a Ma'ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about cases like Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about those about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and imprisoned.  5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status of the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it I understand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one for the occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law). The law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron, it seems. If so, why doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ?  6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to return conflicts with what I was told, namely that hundreds of thousands of non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under Israel control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented from returning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who also left, for example to Europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed to return. How can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ? Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in his homeland ?  7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to that information, Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all inhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh, about 50,000 people.  These expulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other atrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book by Israeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, published by Cambridge University Press. Is this book available in your library ?  8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in Israeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is very little evidence available about that. As much as I know, many Arabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but are not accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not want Arabs ?  9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was whether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to discourage intermarriage. You did not address this question but evaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants to keep it what way'. I am certain that if only religious communities in the U.S. would be asked, they would gladly abolish civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests to officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by a secular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory.   I would be glad to have some more input from you after these comments.\",\"You're right ...

I lived in the Negev for many years and I can say for sure that no Beduins were \\\"moved\\\" or harmed in any way. On the contrary, their standard of living has climbed sharply; many of them now live in rather nice, permanent houses, and own cars. There are quite a few Beduin students in the Ben-Gurion university. There are good, friendly relations between them and the rest of the population.  All the Beduins I met would be rather surprised to read Mr. Davidson's poster, I have to say.\",\" I wholeheartedly agree.  Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies seize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.  WE have to take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create laws and rules only to better their positions within the government.  WE have allowed them to take too much power from the people of this nation.  That situation has to be changed.  Allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off drug informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact with the Devil himself.  It's a vicious cycle.  The law enforcement agencies are motivated to seize property to fund their own activities.  And having no easy way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more incentive for the agencies to take property.  It's also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that Clinton would have the \\\"plumbers\\\" out in force shortly.  Clinton and his henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control.  Anytime a leader believes in that, the leader will use every means possible to retain that control and take more.

Certainly the athletes in Munich were victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters). Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by resistance fighters.

So in a way Islamic law does take precendence over secular law but we are instructed to follow the laws of the land that we live in too.  In an Islamic state (one ruled by a Khaliphate) religions other than Islam are allowed to rule by their own religious laws provided they don't affect the genral population and don't come into direct conflict with state  laws, Dhimmis (non-Muslim population) are exempt from most Islamic laws on religion, such as fighting in a Jihad, giving Zakat (alms giving) etc but are given the benefit of these two acts such as Military protection and if they are poor they will receive Zakat.

Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced to give it up (Ramsey's now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from Mike Foligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy Ruff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, who retired, so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it? After all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit. Jim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, in reverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I'm not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroit and Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smith seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I don't know if the captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games he played for Buffalo.  This is actually getting fascinating.  :-)  Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded, almost, unless you're a franchise player. \",\"I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426  chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu  (file is 5426dr13.zip).

Chances are the government has thought of this, and \\\"just anyone\\\" won't be permitted access to enough of the internals to make a \\\"fake\\\" clipper chip. Chances are that the government has classified some details of the internals at a very high level, and manufacturers are required to observe security safeguards and clearances corresponding to that level.  While not perfect, it would prevent Joe Hacker from rolling his own spoofing chip, since not many counterfeiters can survive a background investigation.

While the EC working rules are more liberal than what we have in the 1989 US-Canada FTA, there's probably a law about that (having health insurance coverage is a condition of my being down here, for example).
