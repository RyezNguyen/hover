to A.J. Teel:   Well, the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the  Income Tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures for  stopping withholding, et cetera have been out there for a  while now.  Humbug.  Those letters don't provide \\\"concrete proof\\\" of anything at all in the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu- ally work for ordinary people in everyday situations.  Specifically, show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that income tax is illegal and/or that ordinary working types do not have to pay income tax (and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with- out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness).  This issue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expect something squarely on point from the US Supreme Court (in the case of federal tax) or a state's supreme court (for a state's income tax).  Unless you can do that, I for one am unwilling to call your material \\\"concrete proof\\\".   There has been no refutation to date.  Have the nay-sayers  finally given up as defeated?  Sure would like to hear their  reasons for disbelief at this point.  Refutation??  Refutation of what?  You haven't made a case yet.  You've posted plenty of claims, but you haven't given us any valid reason to believe that any court in the US will agree with you.  Your claims seem on the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that I feel the burden of proof is still on =you= to show that your arguments have any merit whatsoever.  And the cases you've cited involve such strange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are applicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appeal to the Supreme Court.  Why can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regular employee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay his income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva- sion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court with a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally voluntary?  What, you say?  No such case exists?  Hmmm, I wonder why not; why haven't you?   Shall I conclude that the point has been received and the  opposition has forfeited the field?  With all due respect, you can conclude anything you want.  I just hope, for your own sake, that you don't conclude that anyone in a position of authority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit- ical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions.  For that matter, I confess I'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you would be looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since I thought you told us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with big banking interests since the 1938 \\\"admiralty jurisdiction\\\" coverup thing. Do you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the trouble to subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back into their burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right combination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo?  Not only that, but why do you even =care= what the US courts say anyway? Didn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by US officials to classify you as a \\\"14th Amendment federal citizen\\\"?  When the FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tell them they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington, D.C., where they belong?  Or maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which you suggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like. If you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can just declare you an outlaw, OK?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roads with no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your wallet can just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (with plenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207).  Sorry, everyone, it's getting late, and I'm sick and tired of all this garbage.  If I know what's good for me, I'll just clam up and stop try- ing to refute this nonsense, and if anyone falls for it and winds up in jail for tax evasion or what-not, it'll be on their own head.  Needless to say, none of the above represents the opinions of my current employer -- who, in any case, is a Canadian and doesn't really need to care too much about US tax law.  I, on the other hand, am a \\\"14th Amend- ment federal citizen\\\", with a US passport to prove it, and plan to keep on filing Form 1040's for the foreseeable future (though I will probably not owe any US income tax due to the foreign earned income exclusion and/or the foreign tax credit). \",\"I need to reduce the speed of a Boxer fan by about 30-50%.

Thus far into this playoff season, ESPN/ABC has given me more hockey in 2 days (1 game) than SportsChannel did (0 games).  If people want hockey on TV, they should watch hockey on TV. I bet the ratings for hockey on Sunday on ABC went into the toilet. Next week, there will be far fewer ABC affiliates with hockey.

It is possible to objectively determine someone's guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system. I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state that everything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean that it cannot be objective in theory.   Perhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  Anyway, as I noted before, the practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likely the only ones to be considered \\\"immoral\\\" under the previous \\\"definitions\\\" of the natural law.  Therefore, some revisions are in order, since the class of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.   It seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system because perhaps you think that it would imply inherence, which would necessitate some sort of grand design?   I think I have.  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired behaviors, etc.  An immoral behavior could be unwanted, unproductive, or destructive, etc., depending on the goal of the system (that is, immoral to what end?).\",\" The CU people have been, and continue to be big ozone scientists.

What about the Coke/Pepsi thing  a few years back? NASA has been trying to find ways to get other  people into the space funding business for some time. Frankly, I've  thought about trying it too. When the funding gets tight, only the  innovative get funded. One of the things NASA is big on is co-funding.

In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health insurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like socialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary insurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward. With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.  That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund is to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back in Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \\\"libertarian\\\" faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these).  I'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about leftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian newsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100% insurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't know it, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (American conservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who seriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about the Americans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germans who spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that shouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for insurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that the Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite being open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to spend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a different culture.   \\\"Managed Care\\\" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most western nations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France and Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says of HMO/NHS approaches, \\\"We left that behind with East Germany!\\\"). Sure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling doctors with budget strings.  In Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France and Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public hospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisions are different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked \\\"sickness funds\\\" over a century old while Canada divides by their provinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the doctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)  With such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 to the U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The French and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations in more compact geography to improve scales of economy.  gld\",\" It has some of the most impressive performance figures around, and automotive  magazines eat it up.

It is a '75 850-T. The tires that were on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an owners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are: Front, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and 33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi instead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.  The real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for the front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon Roadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger than that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend, and was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first motorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner tube qualities?  The above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current rear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought 100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be very good at getting close to matching mail order prices.  I am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the front and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer  lasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and FJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive behavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable back end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving much better tire milage life. Any comments?  A friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very good, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to mount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be careful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to check out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and I havn't had a chance to check the rim type.  On another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?) Vetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually I would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be fork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame mounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower bars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition runner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe' style. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is just that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)  -----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------                              edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475                              (208)323-2174   P.O.

If we are going to get anywhere in  this (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never  addressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is  \\\"right\\\" or who is \\\"wrong\\\", only that civilians ARE being used as cover  and that, having been placed \\\"in between\\\" the Israelis and the guerillas, they *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.    [The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms   is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that   civilians will not be thought of by the other side as  \\\"combatants\\\". So, what do you think is the \\\"meaning behind\\\",   the intention and the effect when an \\\"army\\\" purposely   *does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look   like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will   receive from this \\\"cover\\\" is more important that the harm  that will come to civilians.*  This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians in \\\"the middle\\\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians.   But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves  at greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \\\"why set   ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made   cover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of   view, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept   some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.   I agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND ineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait  until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that \\\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\\\" will do more to stop attacks.   As I said previously, Israel spent several decades \\\"sitting passively\\\" on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after* the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well. The \\\"host\\\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks  from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact  on the civilians caught in their path.    This is just another \\\"selectively applied\\\" statement.   The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your criteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.  That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for  the \\\"interim\\\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are demanding conditions that essentially define \\\"autonomy\\\" already. They DO NOT trust that Israel will \\\"follow through\\\" the entire process and allow Palestinians to reach full autonomy.   Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians?  If you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians  be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words? Since they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up \\\"tangible assets  (land, control of areas) in exchange for \\\"words\\\". For this reason, they are also concerned about the sorts of \\\"guarantees\\\" they will have  that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.  Absolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the Israelis \\\"word\\\" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being demanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party finally gets HOLD of this \\\"land\\\", what the \\\"other party\\\" does is totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land, your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to keeps its word does NOT get the land back.   While the \\\"major armaments\\\" (those allowing people to wage \\\"civil wars\\\") have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still remain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and \\\"commando\\\" raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.   Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks were commonplace.   There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively \\\"disarmed\\\" UNLESS the state is as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially mirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.  That's what I said, ok? But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to \\\"take over\\\" Lebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that. What both \\\"sides\\\" need is to receive something \\\"tangible\\\". The Arabs/ Palestinians are looking for \\\"land\\\" and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it gives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHEN it gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks\",\"  Yes, it's a shame that the NHL lost a fine team in one of the best hockey markets in the country.

The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives you nothing is an improvement, but notice that XORing with (truely random) bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents.  Using + for XOR, SK for the escrowed key, and A and B for two random bit strings, hand SK+A+B, SK+A, and SK+B to three escrow agents.  It is possible to come with an encoding scheme to match any escrow pattern, for example 3 of 4, such that fewer cooperating escrow agents gives the cracking agency no benefit.  --       Robert I.

Since the \\\"expectation\\\" is that all chips in a particular batch will uses seeds based on the same S1 and S2 and the serial number, getting the keys for one of a batch may give access to all.)    3) There is a backdoor which allows all messages to be deciphered without the keys.  I find this one especially threatening since the scheme seems very open to known plaintext attacks.  (What I need to decipher is the data in the header.  If I talk to someone who has one of these phones, presumably there will be an automatically negotiated key generated.  I'm not trying to decipher the record of the conversation to know what was said, I use it as a known plaintext to recover the backdoor represented by the header, but I know what the header says for conversations I participate in.  Even worse, if the phones in a series have related keys, I can buy a phone/chip from the same production lot.  Then I can recover its keys, either elegantly by talking to myself, or by brute force analysis of the actual chip, then apply the key generation process with those seeds to find the target keys.)      Hmmm!  I don't think I want to ever come close to these phones. Even DES is starting to look good.  Two cans and a string will provide much better security.    --       Robert I.

I am familiar with    the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally    I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use.    If it has a GUI, I can usually accomplish what I want to do    fairly easily, the command line on the other hand often is    a long and painful experience.   What I hate about GUI's:   - Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess    I have a strong one-handed preference. I like to use a    computer with one hand and use the other for holding something    like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. I have configured my    favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be    done with one hand such as navigating, cutting, pasting,    searching, opening and saving files, etc. The main thing I    need to use both hands for is entering text.

It's only a grantable right if the granter has the will and the ability to stop anyone from taking it away from you. Never mind the legal status.   Nick's right about this.  It's always easier to obtain forgiveness than permission.  Not many people remember that Britain's King George III expressly forbid his american subjects to cross the alleghany/appalachian mountains.  Said subjects basically said, \\\"Stop us if you can.\\\"  He couldn't.   That's how the USA started.  Of course, that's also how the Bolivarian Republic started (ca. 1800-1820) in central america.  It didn't have quite the staying power of the USA.  I'm sure there are more examples of going far away and then ignoring authority, but none jump to mind right now.

However, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all five schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against muslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do not know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and open hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know that historically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone by the death penalty.  My understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the law of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the Qur'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy.  I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \\\"fasad\\\". This ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.   I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book. However, the charge of \\\"fasad\\\" can encompass a number of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that the condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the \\\"crisis\\\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people, not books.  The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz, presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred.  Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this point that the fatwa on \\\"fasad\\\" was issued.  The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The crime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being played out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.\",\"         How about \\\"firearm related.\\\"          Texas is unusual in this regard.  It would be nice to reduce them both, though.         As Texas doesn't appear to have an murder rate that much higher than the national average, I would expect it is a result of a much higher suicide rate.          Be nice if you didn't have to suffer at all.          Here's where we run into a problem.  I am perfectly willing to have government regulation on something which is likely to cause others harm.  What we're discussing, though, is the extreme regulation of a large group in order to target a small group, and I don't think that's appropriate.            Does this, then, justify anything?  At some point you have to draw a line (at least to my way of thinking) where the government must have something a little more substantial than a set of percentages with which to punish an individual.          Where do *you* draw the line?  Or is there one?           Virginia.  It passed.           Does it?           Cute analogy.           The U.S. doesn't treat drunk driving like a serious crime.  However, we also don't confiscate cars of people who drink.  We also don't confiscate *all* cars because some people drink and drive.  It's the core of the legal system that in order to punish an individual (and I'd call property confiscation a punishment) you must have evidence against that individual. That is, it isn't enough to show that the majority of people convicted of murder are white  in order to convict a particular white guy of murder.

We have demands from the Armenians. With the Government of x-Soviet Armenia, we would sit down, go over all our outstanding issues, whether it's land or reparations or recognition, whatever it is. We'd like to sit down and ask for it. By all means, lands and properties were taken away from us and they should be returned to the rightful owners, the Turkish and Kurdish  people, who were there 3,000 years, long before the Armenians ever showed up in that area. Entire population of the region was subjected  to genocide beyond belief; genocide which was planned to exterminate  the whole Turkish people of the region to the last man, woman and child.  Armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians. To  assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings  was one of their methods. Even today the traveler in that region is seldom  free from the evidence of these Armenian crimes.

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2) swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.  2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked to the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity from April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay Antenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to 11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.  3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment data; long term trend analysis is continuing.  6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation index is near the optimal level.  7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument. Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed during the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.  9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant changes (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:         a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 260 hours   GDS (Ground Data Systems):  1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21 (Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller (TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry Subsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The 10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was not metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS data from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of the TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.   TRAJECTORY       As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows:   Distance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)  Distance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)  Heliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour  Distance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km  Round Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds   SPECIAL TOPIC\",\"I have been unable to get COM 4 to work - diagnostic programs such as msd show nothing installed.

Claiming that that truth is absolute, though, seems  to imply a literal reading of the Bible.  If it were absolute truth  (constant across time, culture, etc.) then no interpretation would be  necessary.  It may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different  from person to person.  To me, that doesn't mean that one person is  right and the other is wrong.  I believe that God transcends our simple  minds, and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly  this intent.  God knows me, and knows that my needs are different  from yours or anyone else's.  By claiming that scripture is absolute, then at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrong. I just don't believe that God is that rigid.   This is where the arrogance comes in to play.  Since these principles  are crystal clear to evangelicals, maybe the rest of us should just take their word for it?  Maybe it isn't at all crystal clear to *me* that  their fundamental principles are either fundamental *or* principles.  I think we've established that figuring out Biblical truth is a matter  of human interpretation and therefore error-prone.  Yet you can still  claim that some of them may be crystal clear?  Maybe to a certain  segment of Christianity, but to all.   Not at all.  I think it supports my position much more effectively  than yours.  :-)  So, I think that your position is: The Bible is absolute truth, but as we are prone to error in our  interpretation, we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out  what that truth is. Did I get that right?  What's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending  absolute truth, when we can never know what those truths are, and we  can never (or at least shouldn't) act upon them?

Presumably only recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention. The necessity it refers to has always been there, but it's been implicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of the new window.   [...]  This is because the warning you read is incomplete.  You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a border-pixel, and the problem should go away.  There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair, I'm not entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this.)       der Mouse\",\"With the kind of team Montreal has now,  they can take the cup easily.

As a lo-o-o-ong time sufferer of tinnitus and as a neuroscientist who has looked over the literature carefully I believe the following are reasonable conclusions:  1. Millions of people suffer from chronic tinnitus. 2. The cause it not understood. 3. There is no accepted treatment that cures it. 4. Some experimental treatments may have helped some people a bit, but there have be no reports--even anecdotal--of massive good results with any of these experimental drugs. 5. Some people with chronic loud tinnitus use noise blocking to get to sleep. 6. Sudden onset loud tinnitus can be caused by injuries and sometimes abates or goes away after a few months. 7. Aspirin is well known to exacerbate tinnitus in some people. 8. There is a national association of tinnitus sufferers in the US. 9. One usually gets used to it.  Especially when concentrating on something else the tinnitus becomes unnoticed. 10.  Stress and lack of sleep make tinnitus more annoying, sometimes. 11.

But  most people aren't aware that in 1939 Hitler said that he would pattern his elimination of the Jews based upon what the Armenians did to Turkish people in 1914.        'After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?'       (Adolf Hitler, August 22, 1939: Ruth W. Rosenbaum (Durusoy),            \\\"The Turkish Holocaust - Turk Soykirimi\\\", p. 213.)   I refer to the Turks and Kurds as history's forgotten people. It does not serve our society well when most people are totally unaware of what happened in 1914 where a vicious society, run by fascist Armenians, decided to simply use the phoniest of pretexts as an excuse, for wiping  out a peace-loving, industrious, and very intelligent and productive  ethnic group. What we have is a demand from the fascist government of x-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our people. And the only way we can do that is if we can catch hold of and  not lose sight of the historical precedence in this very century. We  cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to  keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because  of their religion or their race. Which means that I support the claims  of the Turks and Kurds to return to their lands in x-Soviet Armenia,  to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

Michael\",\"Facts: ===== - A Netware Server 286A was roughly moved to a new location and left powered down for three months. - From memory it has an 80 MB hard drive. - Manuals and original disks are for SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a - When powered up, the CMOS was wiped. A technician examined it and  pronounced the disk drive unusable.  My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides). When CMOS set this way, COMPSURF runs happily, with 13 bad blocks.  I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive.  Install will proceed \\\"successfully\\\", but when I try to boot the server, it reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware.  Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present, and there is one disk drive (or at least one large single unit).   Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready errors.  Questions: ========= The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware for level II (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes?   So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?  1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this what is causing my serialisation error? 2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, one of which has failed? 3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive? 4. What else can cause a serialisation error? 5. What happens if the keycard fails? 6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments and guides.  Thanks for your time.

I don't think it is the function overloading at all-- I do that sort of thing all of the time in BC++ without a hitch.  The big problems I have encountered in porting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of invalid C++ assumptions.  I have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but the reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in which static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are getting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the owner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all other pieces of ctrltest work fine.  Two other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:  - The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,   rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ   between MSC and BC).  - All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++   assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place   of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for   references).  I am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have not encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope that some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS's hype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that. \",\"  Sherzer Methodology!!!!!!  \",\"This announcement is somewhat disconcerting; it doesn't do anything evil in and of itself, but bodes badly for the future of open algorithms and standards in information security.  I won't start panicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, but I'm a little anxious.  (No doubt it won't be long before someone posts explaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and long-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to subvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.)  My feeling is that the administration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and RSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they'll never be used by a group much wider than us computer geeks.  The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:  1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just     now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time.  2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able     to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I     find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy     for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the     administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for     all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made     widely available.)

If it is symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level encryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate a per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted third party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session key?)

The right way to do communications security is to generate a random session key with Diffie Hellman, use it for a while and then destroy it. Once it's gone, there's no getting it back, and no way to decrypt recordings of the conversation.  To make sure you aren't being attacked by a man in the middle, you have to authenticate your DH exchanges. The AT&T secure phone does this by displaying the DH key so you can compare them verbally over the phone. This is nice and simple, but it relies on user awareness plus the inability of the man in the middle to duplicate the users' voices.  A better way is to authenticate the exchanges with RSA. Since you'd never use RSA for actual encryption, compromising your RSA secret key would only allow someone to impersonate you in a future conversation, and even that only until you revoke your public key.  They would still not be able to decrypt recordings of prior conversations for which the session keys have been destroyed.  I'm convinced that this is how the government's own secure phones (the STU-III) must work.

For a review, refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 and June 1919.  Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War, and was unclassified after the war. Supposedly, the government rethought this soon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.  The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of their signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore, the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.  IF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of the man who INVENTED wireless: Tesla.

Here's how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that  black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars, M(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking appoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time, they don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any of these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of the galaxy.           Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the various satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either Pion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our catalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic distribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of homogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE. Not cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I suppose you are saying, \\\"Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the disk.\\\"  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out to beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here's an  analogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile away sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different, and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe find a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.           I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also.  As I said before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short timescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of behavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound to the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources. When you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk, but you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources  in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of these characteristics.  \",\"   If given a definite definition of \\\"God\\\", it is sometimes possible to  falsify the existance of that God.

You order distinctive ringing from your phone company.  This is $3/month here. You get a second (unpublished) phone number.  When someone calls this number, your phone rings with short rings instead of long rings.  You set up your answering machine on 4 rings and your fax on six rings.  You'd give out the new # as your fax #. A device would measure the length of rings.  When it detects a short ring, it turns off your answering machine. Five rings later your fax picks up the call.  This should be cheaper and more elegant than the $80 switches now available.  But that's not what I did.  I'm giving out the new # to my friends and customers.  This should leave the old # for telemarketers, etc.  I won't pick up the phone when I hear the long rings.\",\"  This newsgroup is for intelligent discussion.

I must congratulate your analytical and excellent reportage about  Diana. From  the writings  of tye biographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe chauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian genes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian, she   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong characteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian ancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian from  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant Thedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady Diana. It is noteworthy  that Eliza Kewark was also referred  to as  Mrs. Forbesian  (a characteristic Armenian  surname  ending).  An  Armenian-Scottish gene mix is dynamite.  Levon K. Topuzian Assistant Professor Northwestern University Skoie, Illinois.  TIME, December 21, 1992 'Letters'   You have set up straw horses and knocked them down. I'm not impressed. Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.   Source: Stanford J.

Their hope was their participation in the Russian  success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of  Ottoman territories.

Neil Smith                     LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE  [AUTHOR'S NOTE:  \\\"Adrian\\\" -- name changed to protect the guilty --  and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with  the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]  Dear Adrian:    I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to  your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and  generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist  mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back  with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present  now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the  future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.    There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger  of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan.  10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition,  shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic  rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll  limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent  with your note.    First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Second, publication of some latter-day \\\"scientific study\\\" doesn't  alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my  interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.    Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Fourth, as often happens with these things, the \\\"study\\\" doesn't  support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions  anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older  body of lies, omissions, and distortions.    Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on  countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND  BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this  present \\\"study\\\" dubious, to say the least.    Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat  (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you  should be better aware than most people how \\\"progress\\\" -- in  designing \\\"studies\\\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our  ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree  on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30  years to create \\\"studies\\\" \\\"proving\\\" that pornography causes crime.   More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s  clearly indicate the contrary.    Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Tenth, another reason to doubt all such \\\"studies\\\" is that human  behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The  attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the  resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.    Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Twelfth, the \\\"study\\\" is also worthless because it incorporates  figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but  basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social  benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a  criminal offense.    Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials  quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are  many), are correct in this instance:  the \\\"study\\\" is meaningless  because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    And because of that, Adrian, even if the \\\"study\\\" were valid, it  wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that  anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however,  whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's  permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists  themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed  people to go out and buy their first gun \\\"while they still can\\\".   Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the \\\"shooting fraternity\\\"  viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate,  ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in  the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys,  and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we  probably manufacture at least that many every year.  The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly  aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what  their real motives are.    Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way,  it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic;  the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the  self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing  this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a  quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \\\"half life\\\"  of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna  be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.  As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law  provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I  will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is  that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands  -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can  only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given  both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics  and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.

Blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration rate for violent crimes.  So I doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism present.  There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories.  Interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in the rest of the United States! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt blacks.  In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).  Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a situation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.

First of all, when I'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a ``breakthrough in factoring'', what I really mean is a breakthrough in the cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are not proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to repeat this every time.  I also have to admit that I don't really know if the ``non-group'' property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I have thought about it a little while, but I can't find a way that a cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That, of course, means nothing at all.  Then I wrote,   What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the cryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA for a long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people would simply use longer moduli.  Both users and cryptanalysts benefit from better technology in the same way.  Hope this keeps the flames away...  Have fun. \",\" Good question; I don't know what the law considers them.

The FBI and the BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their stupidity and lies.      Now before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as  a bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.  They told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet,  whoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into town on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and  wondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers. First, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they didn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got it.  After the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were coming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that. Well, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.  Did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to them they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised Koresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                   The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he  \\\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out. His grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise David Koresh.\\\"  Someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a logical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.  Here's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that they feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must be done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?  I knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how much money this was costing.  That was the start of the \\\"Justification\\\" part part of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.  But, back to the plan.  It is considered \\\"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\\\" to execute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.  They knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not sure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the  compound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.  I spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR (Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training is going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were subjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical  agent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.  I have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of thing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.  We waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these people 51 days.    I stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole thing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks changed my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:  \\\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the operation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal shot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\\\"  It took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.  One more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic weapons on the premises.

The moral lesson of the story is:  The Lamb of God has been sacrificed and His blood has  been used to cleanse us of our sins every moment as God perceives worthy of being done in Heaven.  Mary weeps for The Lamb and for the rest of her offsprings.  This will continue while we  disobey God or sin against Him.  Mary, as a messenger,  has been given the task to make us be 'aware' of the evil serpent (communism, wars, famine, unfaithful, disobedience to God, etc.) running after the rest of her offsprings.    The children who went astray by disobedience led by the dragon is  brought back by her peace and loving messages, reparations for sins,  to obey God's commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence  of The Lamb.  As she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing the Son of God in her womb, Mary has been preparing us, the Church, the Body of Christ, for His second coming (making sure we are  protected from the dragon).  Also, she has been preparing the new  Eden, by reversing the deed of the ancient Eve.  The new Eden will be the sanctuary of the righteous as judged by Christ in His next coming.      I relate the story again:     I believe this and Mary, in one of her apparitions       in 19th or 20th century, she appeared to these           two children who tends goats and cows (I forgot          the exact place).  She was  weeping and telling the      children that she is afraid she's \\\"going to lose her     Son's arm\\\".  She is mourning too for these               townfolks because it was their fault that there          would be drought in their harvest; not much good         food again this year as it was last year.                                                                         Mary tells the children:                             *    Most of the townfolks in this place worked whole    * *    week even on Sundays when they should be in church  * *    honoring God.  These townfolks swears and           * *    uses her Son's name in bad words.  That is          *     why her Son's arm is so heavy in pain.                   Then she asked them if they pray.  The children          said \\\"hardly\\\".  She asked them to pray every             morning and night.  When the children went back          from work they had to tell somebody about this.          When the news was spred and after thorough           *    investigation of the incident, the townfolks        * *    were converted and faith and obedience to God       * *    were restored in their community.                   *   Once again, the Lamb succeeds.\",\"  I think you have to go a little further back.

When a friend of mine went shopping for a small sedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so the salespeople wouldn't give her the \\\"bimbo\\\" treatment. Her first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan Sentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what \\\"we\\\" wanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid kept playing the \\\"let me run this price by the sales manager\\\".  After playing the \\\"good salesman, bad salesman\\\" game, we finally told him that if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps we should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick in the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's \\\"Don't Get Taken Every Time\\\" for a list.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of \\\"you'll have to work with us on this price\\\", also known as \\\"each time you come up a thousand dollars we'll come down ten\\\", the salesmanager gave a signal to his two sales cronies, stood up, and said \\\"well, we can't come down any more so I guess we can't help you\\\" and they trouped out of the room, leaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm. I'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and I mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the door.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on the desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman, and began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few sentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line (!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call another dealership from \\\"his\\\" phone!  I said that since he'd announced that our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our voices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone, anyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom. Sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he begins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore, we're going next door to the Nissan dealership.  Then comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out the front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom, customers and all, \\\"Go ahead!

In other words, the FBI may need a court-ordered release of escrowed keys, but the NSA has the keys before the chip is ever manufactured. There is no need to go through the escrow or to try all keys.

The report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government should grant  social and political  rights to all the  members of minorities that are equal to  those enjoyed by Greek citizens and in addition  they must  recognize the  existence of  the \\\"Turkish Minority\\\" in Western Thrace and  grant them the right to identify themselves as 'Turks'.

NEWSPOT, January 1993   MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.  Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.    Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis) have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in an Athenian magazine.    Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly magazine  \\\"ENA\\\"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek general election.    Bulev said in the interview: \\\"I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.\\\" Sideropoulos said  in the  article that \\\"Greece  should recognise Macedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations against  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the border, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC are falling.\\\"    The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court summons,  was   that  \\\"they  have   spread...intentionally  false information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the citizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the international interests of the country (Greece).\\\"    The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to 1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely concentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state if anyone declares themselves Macedonian.    In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned Macedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian villages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5 million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000 in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.    Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian human rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a few years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of Florina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the majority of ethnic Macedonians live.    Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent, especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its northern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.    Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who largely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the US government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections are over.  Serdar Argic\",\"From: _Quantum_ Magazine, March/April 1993 pages 42-46   The Problem Book of Anania of Shirak  ------------------------------------    \\\"On the ancient peak of Ararat   The centuries have come like seconds   And passed on.\\\"     -Avetik Issahakian  by Yuri Danilov  Some years ago Journalists interviewing celebrities liked to ask them: \\\"What books would you take with you if you were to go off on a space flight?\\\" And  though the number of books allowed on the trip varied from 10 to 30,  depending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer,  and celebrities are people of the most varied tastes, ages, and professions,  not one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them at least one book of arithmetic problems.  Some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they  were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for \\\"numbers\\\" (though  secretly afraid of them). Others steered clear of such puzzle books because  they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern  mathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't  know how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were  no exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a  specialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \\\"I willingly confess that  any time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was a hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of  my friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route --constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid  using algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it's a fact that is  well known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates,  nor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers (nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It  seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade  teachers.\\\"  Now, I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the  bookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to  recommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most  fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a  relatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to Venus and back.     One for the \\\"road\\\"   They both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley   glanced at the Royal Astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with   a group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. \\\"God   knows what this kind of stuff leads to,\\\" thought Kingsley.   The Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley's book and saw the History   of Herodotus. \\\"Good Lord, next he'll be reading Thucydides,\\\" thought   the Royal Astronomer.      --Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud  The book I'm talking about isn't very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24  elegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same time, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these  problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian  architecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is  now Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant  letters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of  Komitas, or the paintings of Saryan.  An edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a  bibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions of Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh  Century (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).  The abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way  of life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and  worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years  the book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in  Armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just anyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk  Father Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has  brought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the  general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable  problem book.    Vardapet Anania of Shirak   Once fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no   philosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering   it the mother of all wisdom.      --Anania of Shirak  Among ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because  of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his  work. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and Solutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation of scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and Armenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last work was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia,  Movses of Khoren).  In his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:   I, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our  Armenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately,   in the expression of the psalmist, \\\"every day I illuminated the   eyes of my mind.\\\" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,  I came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy,   the mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia   neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the   sciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man   named Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me  that in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,  Christosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But          soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but          only of certain fragmentary facts.   I then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me:   \\\"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the   coast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full   of wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature.\\\" I asked   them how they knew this. They answered: \\\"We saw ourselves that many   people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man.   Indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,  Philagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become   pupils of Tyukhik.\\\" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to   God, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.   I went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I   He sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St.   Gregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself   lived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there.\\\"   Vardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with   me. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated   the science of number, and with such success that my fellow students  at the king's court began to envy me.   I spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not   been translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable   collection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan,   books on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why   enumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did   not have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating  that when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into   Armenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the   translation read as if the work were written in that language   originally.   Tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had   learned the Armenian language. \\\"When I was young,\\\" he said, \\\"I lived   in Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and   for a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I   served as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and   literature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was   wounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to   the Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: \\\"If You prolong my life,   I shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to   collecting treasures of knowledge.\\\" And the Lord heard my prayers.   After I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria   and Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher   from Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned   to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\\\"   After some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for   him, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to   assume the teacher's position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to   God not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because  of his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study   with him.   And I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from   him this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our   country, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God's   help, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me   for my efforts.      Problems and Solutions   A half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed  on verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper;   one forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and   forty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many   copies were printed in all.      --Imitation of Anania of Shirak  A Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\\\"books have their own fate\\\"). The fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The manuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because, according to  Armenian historians, \\\"in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded  from invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children.\\\" Biding their time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of  ancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts). And its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two  manuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction  and commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited,  annotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a  member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).  In the translator's words, the problems of Anania are \\\"amusing, full of life,  and simple.\\\" Orbeli goes on to say: \\\"The subjects of the problems are  generally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland  Shirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are  named, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a  contemporary of Anania.\\\" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used  only \\\"aliquots\\\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is necessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to  represent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).  Like any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the  retelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their  full glory. So let's open Anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages.  Problems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D.  572.  Problem 1  My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the  Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary  heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops.  The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time,  pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third  time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were  still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from  this remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.  Problem 8  During the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak Kamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the Persian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a  day. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent  riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in  a day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.  Problem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian  translation, they are all called \\\"dishes.\\\" But in the original Armenian,  according to Orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are  called mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian  word, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before  Anania's Problems and Solutions.  Problem 18  There was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the  metal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from one fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten  drams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.  Several of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in  Anania's time -- for instance, problem 7.  Problem 7  Once I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank  of the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast.  We caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped out of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found  forty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.  The temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I'll restrain myself and offer you just one more.  Problem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that  inhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no mention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according  to the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of  Shirak offers evidence to the contrary .  Problem 20  The hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik,  was at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild donkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and,  running to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with his brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild  beasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by  arrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were  caught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And  so, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.    \\\"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli\\\"   His biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a   bibliography.     -- K Uzbashyan, Academician      Iosef Abgarovich Orbeli  Anyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the  solution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation  of Anania of Shirak's Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages, has probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders,  and the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great  attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for  a degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma  attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An  advertisement at the end of the book reads: \\\"This book was typeset in  December 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by  me, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with  borders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project  to the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.\\\"  Typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned  orientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage  Museum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had  already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis  Academiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its  rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish  the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian  churches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve  the unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G. Strolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the  blockade of Leningrad in World War II.)  When Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times  were hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania was for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the  printer's craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the  Academy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion of Russian academic typography.     Back to Earth   This book by definition does not exhaust all the most important   works in this domain. The editor hopes that those who are guilty   of this incompleteness will read these lines and, stung by shame,   will work up, if not a collection like this, at least a monograph.     --V.

Maybe one of the space travelers will take  this very copy of Quantum, and another, looking over her shoulder, will read  this article and say to himself: \\\"This Anania from Shirak seems like a pretty  interesting guy. When I get home I'll try to find his problems.\\\"  Good luck, my young friend! Anania is sure to entertain you. Perhaps by then there will be more than n copies of his timeless Problems and Solutions. And  we can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by  Iosef Orbeli.  [1] Vardapet (or vartabed) means teacher or learned man in Armenian. (The     Armenian language suffers in English from a dual transliteration scheme.

I'm going to dispel the propaganda that the DEA is putting out by showing you the drug war's *real* status. To help prove my assertions I've also posted two articles from USA Today that clearly demonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on the rise.  If WOD is working, as we're led to believe, then drug abuse should have gone down substantially by now.  The reality is, is that it has not gone down very much.  If anything, substance abuse is on the rise.  I'm also going to supply a possible solution to this problem.  The following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music and pot entitled \\\"Hello Again, Mary Jane\\\" which appears in the current issue of Time magazine (April 19, 1993, p. 59).      Law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing     smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed.  \\\"Perhaps     because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby     is out in full force,\\\" says Robert Bonner, head of the Drug     Enforcement Administration.  \\\"The fact is, they're losing the     battle.\\\"  In 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said     they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and Bonner     says it is still falling.  Bonner also offers a reminder that     studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of     nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.  The chart that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993 issue of USA Today (\\\"Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eigth-graders\\\" by Mike Snider, p. 6D).

I think you can see that one of the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that the \\\"war on drugs\\\" is being won is to selectively quote statistics--- only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone down.  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is an excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to deceive the public.  Usage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the same time usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution). Also, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone down but drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*.  Therefore, if one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all* the statistics, then it's obvious that the so-called \\\"war on drugs\\\" is being lost.  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs go, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants, then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed in its true perspective.  For those of you who don't consider alcohol to be a drug then try drinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me that it's not a drug.  Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal* drugs.  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless attempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch to another drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular.  The solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to legalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be within reasonable limits (you won't drop dead after using it a few times) and then couple this with a massive drug education program. The reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution is because people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the government's efforts to the contrary---the money spent on drug interdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drug education).  Additionally, legalization would reduce crime because the profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often goes along with other kinds of crime.  Not to mention the fact that addicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their money and posessions in order to support their expensive habit; legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall substantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts.  IMHO, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been done to smokers:  make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to employ heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating them.  As you already know, people in the U.S. smoke a lot less than they used to.  This reduction in the number of smokers has been brought about by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people can light up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco in order to reduce consumption, and so on.  I propose that similar methods be used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried out.  They are as follows:      * Drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which       states the possible health hazzards involved with using this       product and recommendations on how the drug should be used.       Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used       ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in.      * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of       revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs       through illegal channels.  Part of the revenue collected from       drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law       enforcement.      * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of       18).  Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the       taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent.       Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning       information should also be a felony.      * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the       purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible.  This       agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad       drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now.  I'm sure that many of the things I've discussed in this article have been hashed out before in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, I thought it was a good idea to give my two cents (actually a buck and a half...) all at once so you could get a good idea of where I currently stand on WOD.  Go ahead and tear into my post; I'm sure there is something in it that you may wish to take a different view on or flame. :) :) :)  BTW, I posted the articles from USA Today to not only help prove my assertions but also to provide information on LSD usage among youths--- something which I noticed some posters to this group were interested in.

I moved there from Novosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferred to Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name is Arutunian, my husband's name . . .  That there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints  and gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the  Russians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past  year. I couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because  I, I'll just say it, couldn't steal, couldn't deceive, and couldn't be  involved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they  told me, \\\"Leave, don't keep the others from working, you aren't cut out for  this kind of work.\\\" And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at  the Armenians, like \\\"The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way they've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live,\\\" and \\\"Things  will be just fine if we get rid of them all.\\\" \\\"No problem, the Turks will  help,\\\" they say, \\\"if we ask them, they'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an  hour.\\\" Well that's the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it  would spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn't imagine it.  Here we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one  even considered such an idea possible.  But I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative  people I would often ask, \\\"Where is this all leading, do people really not see what kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait,  there are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what's going on?\\\" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that  everything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of  it if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the demonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn't be saying this now if I  hadn't received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were  under guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade.  The women told me, \\\"There he is, there he is, that's Muslimzade.\\\" I didn't  believe the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that  they were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, \\\"Are you the First  Secretary of our City Party Committee?\\\" He answers me, \\\"Yes.\\\" And I ask him,  \\\"Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani  flag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don't know  exactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?\\\" And he tells me, \\\"Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it.\\\" Then I asked him another question: \\\"And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering  us? And he said, \\\"I. . . We didn't know what to do, we didn't know, we didn't  anticipate that that would happen in Sumgait.\\\"  Comrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the  Azerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: \\\"No, we actually didn't  anticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain  the crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre.\\\" Those are his  exact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the Armenian SSR.  And now, about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them,  because it may seem that it's not true to someone else. Various rumors  concerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't.  But unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so  horrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of progress, I don't know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in or around Moscow, I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really  a genocide, it was a massacre. That's genuinely what it was.  For example, on that day, the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my  husband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on  the 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, \\\"You're in bed? You don't  know anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they  were overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars  and asking, 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian, then they  turned the car over and burned it.\\\" This isn't made up, the wife of the Senior Investigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was  returning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she's my  neighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the  middle of it, I don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they  were stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him honk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it, and  I said, \\\"Certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?\\\" And she said,  \\\"Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely smashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw  that they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, \\\"Don't break  the shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want. \\\" I didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was torn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians  although he's an Azerbaijani.  While we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova is the first to look out the window and say, \\\"Look, there's a crowd out  there.\\\" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had  already started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian  family there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I  don't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my  husband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3.  There was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things  were going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once  wasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished the Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they  beat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing  the hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on  television, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell  us why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't  have touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the  Armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.  At the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there,  and so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly  off a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down  there, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At  first I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband,  \\\"Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there.\\\" And he answered, \\\"I  don't know, could be.\\\" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw  it, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way,  he didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging  her. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell  down, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their  balconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of  blocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two  from here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.  Then the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can of course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And I also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented that woman, because I had just seen that.  I asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, \\\"You kill me first, and then  let them do what they want with the corpse.\\\" But our neighbors, it's true,  defended us, they said, \\\"There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away,  only Muslims live here.\\\" Disaster missed us that time.  But at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately,  came back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's  upset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to  balcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as  though it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever,  and I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look  and the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first  time they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the  morning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the  Azerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them  too. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking garbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went  toward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you  could see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke  Azerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, \\\"What do you want?\\\" And  they answered, \\\"We want the Armenian family that lives here\\\" [pointing toward  the second floor with their hands]. She says, \\\"I already told you, we don't  have any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman  talking to you,\\\" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around her and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they  seemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing  and left. That was the second time death was at our door.  I forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there,  I don't know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we  really didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth  floor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight  months, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to  earn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture  and was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas, everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything  out the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on  the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that  hadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means  that the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to  be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been  foreseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of  apartments. Something on the order of \\\"We'll move the Armenians out and take  over their apartments.\\\"  I have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I  came as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the  Consulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I  knew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in  Sumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that Party membership was  bought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were  no ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw  all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.  I can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I went out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they  had arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some  Russian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and joined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with  the situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on  the buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure  people would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for  the Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But  having analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having  thought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people.  If a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed,  and that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to  calm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom he could whisper at the last minute, \\\"Go and announce it on television:  Citizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let's protect our  neighbors from this massacre?\\\" Those crowds weren't such that there was no  controlling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn't have firearms,  mostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature  shafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we  noticed them: there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were  brought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was  saying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend  us, why wasn't it arranged? It means that the government didn't want to do  it. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik,  what, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out! The crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won't mention the things  I didn't see myself, I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They  were in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when I saw them from the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one  o'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They hadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8.  When they returned to our building I told my husband, \\\"Lendrush, now the  police are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably  going to find out and come to our aid.\\\" Well, alas, no, there were to be no  authorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single  ambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out, beginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments, and burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned,  it was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in  Block 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they  attacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed soldiers, and how on that square, I can't remember the name of it, where there is that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I'm upset and I can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and  from the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers,  wearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against  that mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using  stones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have  guessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under  the Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under  Soviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get  involved.  If you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the truth, I've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five  years that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered  me a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I'm an adventure seeker, and some, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become outraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a  Soviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property, or the property of some magnate, or some \\\"mafia\\\": If I want to, I'll get you  out of here; If I want to, I'll get rid of you; If I want to, I'll do  something else? And there's a black market price for everything, in the most  brazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so much. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had  the nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, I'm afraid, I heard with my own ears: \\\"Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something that you know will never have any effect? You're alone against everyone, so  instead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything  will go fine for you.\\\" I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I  do, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless. And the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see it. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed  it, I still have a copy, but what's the use? When the General Procuracy got  involved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to  the information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony  about the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don't know  if they're going to pursue it or not. Because, you'll excuse me, I no longer  believe in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It's all  dead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most  important, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that's nonsense, that all comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in  you--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...  I want to tell of one incident. I just don't know, at the time I was in such a state that I didn't even take minor things into account. Here is an example. Of course, it's not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a son, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy, Vitaly [Danielian], I don't know his last name, goes to school with him, or rather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to make a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there's one important detail: When the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in  Armenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments. But the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call  anywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off for no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they liked They weren't afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap  their hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.  Now I'm going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an Armenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class.  According to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the same apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put through--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to his mother and said, \\\"Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they kill him? Maybe he's still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow. . . . He's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart.\\\" His  mother wouldn't let him go. In tears, she says, \\\"Valery, you can't go because  I am afraid.\\\" He says, \\\"Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch,  just have a look.\\\" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's parents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a  superficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken  everywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian  apartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that  the windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows  in that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and  Vitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already  been murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks  ago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we  left Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to  Yerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this  straight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family has been killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and his classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit  them, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in  a coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being  kicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought  there in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .  When we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another,  throw ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if  these friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And when you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When you saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.  If you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of  things it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped  were entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I'm not lying,  that girlfriend came up to one of them and said, \\\"What happened?\\\" and she  bared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . .  those rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that  I don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.  Now . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided, well, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny, some six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group of people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a point when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw so much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .  Yes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians around Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground with bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who  don't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when  I arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are  not only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they  were guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a  single person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan  all the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack  anyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there could have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are  guilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in Azerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not only perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it  seems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; \\\"Did  you know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31  people, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an  Armenian?\\\"  Of course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and not become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to the time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee. When I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I  couldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already mentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, \\\"Why  did you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at  these women who are strewn about on the floor?\\\" The overcrowding there was  tremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were already sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They  cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but  the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at  it everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they  were never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized to do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening that Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait,  was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored  personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart  advised him, and relocate people to the military unit.  But that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically,  tried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party Committee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the hand and said, \\\"Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office. I told him, \\\"No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of  what you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the  traces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . \\\" Oh  yes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even  very funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice,  expensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, \\\"Oh, why  did you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume, you're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came to ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are already getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at them?\\\" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who  he was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head  and hid it. Then I said, \\\"My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We  didn't come to you with the intention of stealing!\\\" \\\"Well kill me, kill me!\\\"  Muslimzade says to me, \\\"But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not guilty.\\\" And I say, \\\"OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give  us an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and  raping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things,  carrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you  then?\\\" \\\"You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't  anticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.\\\" I started  laughing and said, \\\"It's truly funny.\\\" He says, \\\"What could I do? We didn't  know what to do.\\\" And I say, \\\"I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell  you: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in  front with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross  over his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was  during the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself; either he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran  away, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid,  excuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you,  you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done?  That's right,\\\" I told him, \\\"the City party committee got confused, all the  party committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused,  they all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with  impunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two  days, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would  have finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some  Russians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told  them, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too.\\\"  And by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was the one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later arrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to the military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We  asked him, \\\"What? How? What will come of us?\\\" He openly said, \\\"You know, for  us the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll stay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later.\\\" The  General Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all  cities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because  the affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke; as everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When  he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit,  by the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it,  because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen,  and he said, \\\"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's horrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely  punished, in accordance with our laws.\\\" And that's a quote. Then one mother  throws herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says, \\\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\\\" They tried  to calm her down, and he said, \\\"In order for us to conduct a proper  investigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you  must help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang  who is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe  someone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that  you're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having  lived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth  about, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge  later. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you  can throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The  names of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the information. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is  necessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening  gibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put  the information into the urn.\\\"  Two soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people,  people who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she  came up and said, \\\"You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as  will happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you  please write it down for me.\\\" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like her . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down everything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if  it will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that  information. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply  can't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example,  should someone say that black is white if it is really black?     The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani SSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council  of Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the  one who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their  previous dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him,  and it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very  politely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and  when I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, \\\"Where were you personally when they were beating us? Now you're trying to convince us to  return, why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where  it was all leading?\\\" he says, \\\"You're telling the truth. Let's not mince  words. You've told me right to my face, and I'll tell you straight. I'll tell  you the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole  government was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about  45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its  fine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku.\\\" I say, \\\"So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting  it?\\\" And he says, \\\"You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it  in Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . \\\" I say, \\\"Fine,  you didn't know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have  known. Why did no one help us?\\\" And he says, \\\"Well, OK, we didn't know what to do\\\" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from  Muslimzade. Later, when he said, \\\"You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is  favorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the  Azerbaijanis . . . \\\" To this l answered, \\\"You know what . . . I'm speaking  with you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with  Armenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me,  please, Comrade Mamedov, \\\" I asked him, \\\"What would you say about this honestly, if you were being completely frank with us?\\\" Then he said, \\\"Yes, I  admit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we  have disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before  the whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign  radio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too.\\\" And I say, \\\"There's nothing to add to what really happened. I don't think it's possible to add anything more awful.\\\" He says, \\\"Yes, I agree with you, I  understand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence.\\\" I repeat that he said \\\"unfortunate occurrence.\\\" And then he suddenly remembered himself, what  he was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously-- and said, \\\"Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . \\\" I take this to mean that  he really thinks it's an \\\"unfortunate occurrence.\\\" \\\"And of course,\\\" he says,  \\\"I understand that having gone through all this you can't return to Sumgait,  but it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being  tried.\\\" And he even gave a detail, which, I don't know if it matters or not,  that 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody  affair.  Yes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in Baku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an  Azerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, \\\"What, they didn't nail your husband? They screwed up.\\\" I was floored, I hadn't imagined that anyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up to see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was going to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from  February 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, \\\"I don't know,  Tatyana, go to the head of the conductors' pool. Be grateful if they don't  put it down as unexcused absence.\\\" I was really discouraged by this. They all  know that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here  they're telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying  myself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name is Rasulov, and he's had that position for many years. Incidentally, he's a  Party member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and  said, \\\"Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . \\\" He looked at me askance and said, \\\"And why are you\\\"--he knows me by my previous last name--\\\"why did you get wrapped up in this mess?\\\" I say, \\\"What do you mean, why did I get  wrapped up in this mess? My husband's an Armenian,\\\" I tell him, \\\"I have an  Armenian last name.\\\" And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as  though he had eaten something sour, and said, \\\"I didn't expect that you would . . . \\\" What did he mean by that? And \\\"how\\\" should he behave, the chief of the pool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it's true, there was a  reduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And  if someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what  can you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?! He's going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this,  the Armenians are like that, and so on . . .  By the way, that Mamedov--now I'm going back to Mamedov's office when I asked  him \\\"Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return  to Sumgait?\\\" he answered, \\\"Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don't want to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I  won't guarantee them for longer than 50 years.\\\" I say, \\\"So you've got another thing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they'll be quiet and then  in another 50 years it'll happen again?!\\\" I couldn't contain myself any more, and I also told him, \\\"And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew about it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in  Sumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received complaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did  everyone ignore what was going on? Didn't you prepare people for this by the  way you treated them?\\\" And he says, \\\"You know, you're finally starting to  insult me!\\\" He threw his pen on the desk. \\\"Maybe now you'll say I'm a  scoundrel too?\\\" I say, \\\"You know, I'm not talking about you because I don't  know. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that  comrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain. \\\"Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors,  that 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had  gotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good.  \\\"We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of  the Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of  Armenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in Sumgait.\\\" When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, ' \\\"Well, I walked down the street.\\\" And I said, \\\"Walking down the street in any  city, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation because I would be a guest, I don't have any contact with people, but if you  spend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn't  know you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you'd  hear something quite different.\\\" I told him, for example, that I drew my  conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took us all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit; they got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the  neighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I  thought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general, of a mass nature, some anti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it was the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier  accompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything  there were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with us, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young  people, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they  were making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when police detachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and  tanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when  the situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they  withdraw protection from the city altogether? There will be more outrages, of  course, perhaps not organized, but in the alleys . . .

Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to 3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).  A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.  - A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull   the trigger again. - A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,   but will fire merely by pulling the trigger. - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again   to rotate to the next round. - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the   hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an   easy motion, even one handed. - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines   on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.  - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell   first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often   lost as you realize \\\"hey, it's jammed!\\\" before starting to do anything   about clearing it. - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round   and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the    chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider   this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed   of employment as a revolver. - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of   operation of many of them requires more training.  Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having accidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks require rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a VCR.  Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter and pay attention. I do not seek here to say \\\"semi-autos are junk\\\" merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot.  Gun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a  wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything. Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit. I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit what I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously wrong somewheres.

Of cause, the R4-version  did not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass    instead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition    (formerly XtTblPosition).  Since compiling with R5, the program causes a zero width or height error  (on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the  model_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText   widgets) exist, XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of    zero.   Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the    width and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup   or XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on    whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource    file or not).    Question: Does anyone know, why XtQueryGeometry returns so low prefered    values when working on table widgets or perhaps what    to do about?   I'll be happy, if someone is able to help me.

I haven't seen anybody write that AIDS was a *punishment* for certain types of sin (this includes Mark Ashley who you were responding to here).  I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way that curses will come on you and others.  Although one definition of 'curse' is 'retribution', I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used the word.  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in his Bible.  God doesn't cause curses, he warns us of them.  Kevin Davis wrote (a while ago):  The Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death (which is much worse than AIDS) -- we have all hurt God with our sin.  Paul Conditt reveals his feelings:  The first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is \\\"obvious\\\"ly wrong to be angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angry which is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at us for putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was \\\"forgive them Father, they know not what they do.\\\"  Knowing how forgiving Jesus has been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of love for Him.  Please don't give in to anger, it will only cause foolish quarrels and more bad feelings.  It's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need to address it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone out there was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with AIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I would frame a response something like this:  \\\"It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which is simply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishment for people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of his children equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  We will all be judged after we die, but until then we all have the opportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him with all of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of our sin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new life for him.  Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is not to short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart or a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even through the worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all men that they may perhaps reach out and find him.\\\"  The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears of people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing is actually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in the earlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't been expressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount your perceptions, but please try to be open-minded.  You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people because they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters and I do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of the city and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with some brothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so that you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.  The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual contracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their salvation in that there may be repetence involved.  The important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God's commands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm or misfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way to prevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways, is to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife or husband.  I hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.  Love,\",\"Hi net! Due to further investigation I would like to study the following article:  Peterson, \\\"Ray tracing general B-Splines\\\",  Proc.

Thanks a lot,  Joerg Haber \",\"for SRC  In most languages, the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is known as the PASCH, or PASQUE, or some variation thereof, a word which comes from the Hebrew PESACH, meaning \\\"Passover.\\\" In English, German, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER, or some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the origin of this term.  One explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE RATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great scholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived 673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of the word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well established before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely that his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that there had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name, and the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance (surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should have a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf convincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does not make it more so.  Assuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the Christian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some centuries before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots. It would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians and beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every spring, called it by the name that to them meant simply \\\"Spring Festival.\\\"  However, Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J Knoblech, in \\\"Die Sprach,\\\" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5 (Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:  Among Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast of the Resurrection was known as \\\"hebdomada alba\\\" (white week), since the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their white baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was referred to simply as \\\"albae.\\\" Translaters rendering this into German mistook it for the plural of \\\"alba,\\\" meaning \\\"dawn.\\\" They accordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for \\\"dawn.\\\" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.

If this were so, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide would be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in cities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show a higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this not to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks (which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants), the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the proportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.  What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on the part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended to show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave physical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the head neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this pattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.

If you drop out the   : drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.  There are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I'm not fond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and Americans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic differences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I don't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent crime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every law-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.  On the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more culturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive, seven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates of Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities with roughly the same population, urban economy, geography and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.  In Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After a 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed weapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.  In Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason to purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted. Recreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are regulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a restricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box. In short, gun control but not unreasonably so.  Both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for gun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers studied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated), burglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from 1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same standard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.  Results: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver (1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99). 18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in Vancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 / 1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher (1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by weapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged. Although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were far more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.  Over the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle (11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000). After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations, the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as compared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.  When homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate of homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in Seattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver. Virtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns accounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns were 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than in Vancouver.  The authors of the report also investigated \\\"legally justifiable\\\" homicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during the seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only 21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in Seattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After excluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these earlier findings.  -------  This is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the argument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because Vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times that of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports annual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC, Chicago, Los Angeles and Houston.  Critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a gun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently. If the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to be higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study interval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns was not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that few would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.  As well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding citizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did experience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these cases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities during the course of the study period.  And, as was reported, Seattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category over Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for self-defense.

Madness takes its toll - please have exact change                             \",\" Ok, so there are in fact two distinct components transmitted by the chip; the real message encrypted with the \\\"conventional\\\" key, and the serial number and encrypted \\\"conventional\\\" key encrypted with the (IMHO kind of bogus, as the whole concept of \\\"one key that millions of people use which can't be changed\\\" doesn't seem reasonable) \\\"family key\\\".  Suppose I analyze the output of this chip and I'm able to determine which bits are the encrypted packet which contains the serial number and session key.  Suppose I also design a simple algorithm based on this information which takes the data containing the encrypted session key and twiddles a bit (or several) before it's sent down the line.  Mind you, I'm sure the NSA thought of this along with a dozen other attacks I can't imagine, and the system is probably somehow designed so that manipulation of this information will cause a compliant receiving chip to somehow fail to decrypt successfully.  But how? What if the two parties agree in advance on some kind of consistent bit-twiddling scheme, so the decryption chip sees the restored \\\"proper\\\" bitstream but an eavesdropper gets a E[K; UK] packet that's wrong?  I suppose this could be easily defeated if the chip \\\"sends\\\" that information out many times in slightly different ways, making it effectively impossible to be certain you know all the information being sent.\",\" I was trying to avoid a discussion of the whether Clintons views should be endorsed or not.  All I was trying to find out was  whether the newspaper article was correct in making these statements about the President by obtaining some information about when and where he made these statements.  Thank you.\",\"Here are four pseudo-random character generators, based on irreducible trinomials.  Each contains 16 separate trinomials, one of which is selected on initialization (there are 64 distinct trinomials between the 4 PRCGs).  The PRCGs are initialized with a 32-bit seed, and a 4-bit trinomial- selector.  I would like to get comments on these by anyone who is interested enough to look them over.

It seems that many of these Lebanese youth are unable to restrain themselves from violence, and unable to to realize that their actions prolong Israels stay in South Lebanon.   If the Lebanese army was able to maintain the peace, then Israel would not have to be there.  Until it is, Israel prefers that its soldiers die rather than its children.     Israel should withdraw from Lebanon when a peace treaty is signed.  Not a day before.  Withdraw because of casualties would tell the Lebanese people that all they need to do to push Israel around is kill a few soldiers.  Its not gonna happen.     Why should Israel not demand this while holding the buffer zone?  It seems to me that the better bargaining position is while holding your neighbors land.  If Lebanon were willing to agree to those conditions, Israel would quite probably have left already. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that the Lebanese can disarm the Hizbolah, and maintain the peace.

The answers I received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working. However, during this process I have come up with new problems.  1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic string. Is this inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS or VB?  2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the DDE SQL command, (provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names) but how is one meant to update a database?    a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.    b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command from VB cannot       be used because when the macro requests information from VB using a       second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time- outs occur.       (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access to VB channel       is initiated, I guess.)    c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.      The way I eventually managed to update a database was by sending key-    strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. This technique has    the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a    state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB sends.  Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect assumptions? Are there any better work arounds to the above?

He works hard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an offensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed to make the team next year.  #3 DAVID WILLIAMS  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, free agent from New Jersey Grade:  C/C-  IMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92, playing a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and good defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City, was good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that '91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he was prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last year.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.  #4 JAYSON MORE  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft Grade:  B+  After being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp before '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not particularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then, proceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most reliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash. Offensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73 games), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.  #5 NEIL WILKINSON  Season: 4th Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  B-  Wilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However, partially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25 games total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed even when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners; that is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if he can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.  #6 SANDIS OZOLINSH  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft Grade:  I (A)  At the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers), Ozolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury in that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games), but he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points), which, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from their defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still susceptible to so-called \\\"rookie mistakes,\\\" but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back from his injuries, he is ready to be a star.  #19 DOUG ZMOLEK  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  B  Zmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks to play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but after being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points). He was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the team; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to become a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and defensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.\",\"   No, he does not.

The Palestinian leadership    has stopped, or at least this is what has been said in the media, this    happened on the way to the dialogue with the United States, the PLO    recognized something called \\\"Israel\\\"...  A: No, no, no!  We do not recognize the State of Israel.  We said    \\\"recognition\\\" -- when a Palestinian state is established.  It will then    decide if to recognize Israel or not.  When it is established, its    parliament will convene and decide.    And replace them with what?  If Israel is to withdraw its control of any territory, there must be two prerequsites.  One is that it leads to a reduction in deaths.  The second is that it should not weaken Israels bargianing position with respect to peace talks.   Leaving Gaza unilateraly is a bad idea because it encourages arabs to think they can get what they want by killing Jews.  The only way Israel should pull out of Gaza is at the end of negotiations. These negotiations should lead to a mutually agreeable solution with security guarantees for both sides.

Trev\",\"Today marks the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and x-Soviet Armenia. The following letter, which represents a small portion  of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical  documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs,  was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors,  program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and  radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide  of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people  of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the  lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is  mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their  lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations  may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and  prosperously.  ------------------------- letter ----------------------------------  During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government  has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which  not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the  method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day,  Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order  to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland,  which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia  continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:  1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility.  2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism  Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish  Genocide.  3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to  silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.  4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.  Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government  is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.  Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its  terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks  to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically  exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on  this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of  governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition  of the Turkish Genocide.  With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial demands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims of the Turkish Genocide demand:  1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian  Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;  2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and Kurdish people;  3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for  their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;  4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian political pressure;  5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it  has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially  recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be  supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;  6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact  of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of  2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.  The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first  genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new  generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically mature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through all necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the  armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon all Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in  the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.

I'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I can help a little.    Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects for both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on high-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames per second).     It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is. True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations.  Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15 frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general does not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the UNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time operation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes.  Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time operation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not even SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due to their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.  From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2 systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.    You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop VR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.  Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which dominates the cost of the project.\",\"(2nd posting of the question that just doesn't seem to get answered)  Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib graphics.  A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window.

Using an expose event handler is a \\\"proper\\\" way to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is guaranteed to be mapped.  The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow \\\"tickle\\\" the Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.\",\" [KAAN] Who the hell is this guy David Davidian.

Again from my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}: Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some   specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller   specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.    Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the   end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a  SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2  which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it   needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be   very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst   {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and  reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between  SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.  IBM HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: [...] IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.  So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES  the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can. The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}\",\" I, too, have a XC68882RC50 math coprocessor, which I installed succesfully in my Mega Midget Racer (clocked at 33 MHz).

Several people responded with good information, but I don't think I communicated  exactly what I am looking for.  I'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a host via RS-232.  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and require about 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM).  In looking around, I see that lots of people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to be interfaced to your custom I/O devices.  It's been done so much, that it  would be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to use an 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then  transfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROM needs to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytes to/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS). Everything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much for this application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UART built-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.  Does anyone know a  company that markets a good board in this range, or some public domain  circuitry I can use?

Dick.\",\" excellent question timothy. i hpoe the answers you get will be satisfactory   as we can not understand the mind of god. but to attempt to answer you   clearly. GOD of the Bible has given us humans relativly little about how he   intends to judge mankind. the first test is those who have beleived that Jesus   Christ is the Son of GOD and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to   serve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god,   the bible calls this sin. for those who die before the end of the world/have   already died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche.   God must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world. however   there is no plus and minus system for GOD. he has declared that he can not   tolerate spiritual imperfection, thus he can only based your worthiness to   live with him on the wrong in your life.    Good people, yes even Christians are going to constantly sin before GOD, The   Christian hoever thanks GOD that Christ has given his life for his sin's   penalty. the proscribed punishment for sin is death, just as the proscribed   punishment for robbery is time in jail. God then cannot ask for anything but   punishement for those sins. He does not want to condem. the Bible says in John   3:17, that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that   through him it might be saved.\\\" when i realize that i have sinned, and i do   with painful regularity, i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin   against me, i have that right and privlige only because of Christ. as for Jews   they are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come, and   dis come in Jesus of Nazereth. Muslims, i fear have been given a lie from the   fater of lies, Satan. They need Christ as do us all.   for those who don't have that right, in the view of the bible they stand   olone in their defense. are you going to hell? i can not answer that for you.   i can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to   Hell? that step is much more rewarding.  stan toney stoney@oyster.smcm.edu my opinions are my own, you may borrow them\",\"This is for a friend of mine.

Around a million Americans every year defend themselves with firearms.  In many of these cases the defender doesn't even have to fire a shot!  The mere presence of a gun is oftentimes all the deterrent that is needed.  I don't like violence anymore than anyone else does.  But, taking away the right of Americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent crime problem in this country.  If honest, law-abiding citizens are unable to get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will be able to acquire guns through illegal channels.  Expect to start seeing the crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling guns.  Believe me this will happen.  There is *plenty* of economic incentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns should be banned by the Klintonistas.   Statistics, por favor?   See my previous post.  That ought to set you straight.   People have the right to keep and bear arms no matter what the Constitution says.  That means that even if the 2nd Amendment is repealed the *people* (that's all American citizens FYI) will *still* have the right to keep and bear arms.

You lurkers can join in at any time, you know!  Ahhh.. Talk.politics.guns -- the kindler, gentler newsgroup.  Who would have thought?    I remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5' a reasonable space limitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to those nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at what distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the endangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility of being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and draw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user. Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault rifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has only range and acurracy going for it.    I disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this is not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change quite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians intent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.    That seems to be the case already, given that heavy weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low numbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks, whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.    I had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers of a select group, and the like would exercise control over the heavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman tank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders from the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large, though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should therefore be jointly maintained and operated.    This I'll agree with to a point.  The State having control over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state to have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that the ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise, I would have to assume that State control would rest on the authority of the Governor and militia officers.    I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons, fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few people with government support.  Just as you argued above that the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry. I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.    We have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble. I'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their armory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in. I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.    So would I, but the resources often aren't available to outfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to call in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster than anything else.    Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up field pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton trucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff of a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units in Iowa are currently fielding in some units.   Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy equipment under State control, with little but numbers and light stuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local ranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly, hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally, the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for other responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a very minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias for these functions.\",\"The BusLogic cards have an OS/2 2.0 driver that does work with the March 2.1 beta.

Mr. Read         said you can't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and         then throwing the frog in.  His reflexes are so quick that         as soon as his feet touch the water, he will leap away.         You must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it         up bit by bit.  By the time the frog realizes he's being         cooked, it is too late.  It is the same with Americans.         If anyone tried to take our freedoms all at once, we         would naturally rebel and suppress the tyrant.  But as         with successful frog cooking, our liberties can be taken         a little bit at a time.  The last line of the article says, \\\"It's not too late for us, but the water is getting pretty warm.\\\"  I'd have toagree that it's warm and the Clipper is keeping the temperature on an upward course.  NOTE: followups redirected to alt.privacy.clipper \",\" This algorithm works well for me:  Algorithm to attempt to find outward-facing normals: --------------------------------------------------- First, mark all faces as UNKNOWN.  Then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the faces sharing a given edge (where an edge is two integers representing the two shared vertices).  Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE.  Using the edge dictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of this face.  And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistently orienting the entire surface.  Find the average of the vertices in this surface.  Using that point, calculate a volume measurement, taking into account the face's orientation.  If the volume turns out to be positive, assume the faces are oriented correctly.  If it is negative, reverse their orientations (mark them CLOCKWISE).  If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this, choose another face and go through the algorithm again.  At the end, faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversed before facet normals are found.  (Note: if you are running on Silicon Graphics machines and buy the IRIS Inventor 3D toolkit developers package you have the source to this algorithm-- see /usr/src/Inventor/tools/ivnorm/.  If you're not... sorry, I can't give out the source, and even if I could it relies heavily on Inventor).\",\"I have an 8514/A card, and I am using windows in 1024x768 mode   (normal 8514/A font, not small).

Thanks.\",\" Hi Brad,  I have two comments:  Regarding your hope that the \\\"occupation will end...  belive that stiff resistance..etc. - how about an untried approach, i.e., peace and cooperation.  I can't help but wonder what would happen if all violence against Israelis stopped.  Hopefully, violence against Arabs would stop at the same time.  If a state of non-violence could be  maintained, perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved, i.e., greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the \\\"territories\\\".    Of course, given the current leadership of Israel, your way may work also - but if that leadership changes, e.g., to someone with Ariel Sharon's mentality, then I would predict a considerable loss of life, i.e., no winners.  Secondly, regarding your comment about the U.S. troops responding to \\\"stiff resistance\\\" - the analogy is not quite valid.  The U.S. troops could get out of the neighborhood altogether.  The Israelis could not.  Just my $.02 worth, no offense intended.  Respectfully,     \",\"Quoting pmetzger@snark.shearson.com (Perry E.

Toronto, to the Cup finals???  First of all, has anyone on the planet heard of the team from Detroit?

I don't get it, he says it's an \\\"easy choice\\\"? God, Chicago was 1-4-1 against the Wings, and they won the division by a point or two, followed closely by Toronto, who is also a good team! As for the Leafs beating Detroit--doubt it, but even if they do, they aren't going to get by Chicago.  If (even more amazingly) they get past the Hawks, they would probably face Vancouver, and lose. As for The Habs reaching the Finals, forget it.  Even I, as a devoted Wings fan, will watch the Penguins easily three-peat as Cup winners.  Lemieux, Jagr, Tocchet, Stevens, and Barrasso, its a done deal.  Sorry Detroit, wait til next year. But hey, these were Paul's picks, and everyone has a right to their own opinnions, but the Leafs to the Finals??? Yeah.

This action comes as local, state and federal law enforcement officials continue their assault on the Branch Davidian compound--an assault which has already resulted in the death of one two year old child at the hands of federal agents.

This gives t0' and t1'.  The interval of intersection is then the bit of the line from [t0,t1] INTERSECT [t0',t1'].

My understandingis that former officer Cranston approached a teenager who was being questioned by another officer.   Officer Cranston struck Teenager A in the head with a heavy police flashlight, causing a significant, though not life-threatening.  THere is no evidence that Teenager A was doing anything threatening at the time.  Teenager A was released on bail/recognizance and filed a formal complaint against Officer Cranston.  The Police Chief suspended Cranston pending an  investigation into the use of excessive force.    The above is pretty clear... but what seems to have  happened is this.  The Chief requested Cranston's gun, but Cranston refused to turn it over until the Chief went the Cranston's home  to get it.  Sources said Cranston had always wanted to be a cop and was very afraid of loosing his job because of the complaint against him.  A few days afterward, Cranston allegedly walked into  Wilson's Garage, where Teenager A and friends were known to hang out and work on cars as a hobby.  Cranston fatally shot Teenager A as well as TEenagers B and C.  Teenager D was shot once in the shoulder/chest.  Teenager E was working under the car and was not noticed by Officer Cranston.  Teenager D went to a home and summoned police, who went to Wilson's Garage and found the  3 corpses and one unscathed survivor.\",\"I look at zApp and really liked it. However, I think you should wait for version 2.0 (I think it will be out soon).\",\"  Since running any GUI over a network is going to slow it down by a fair amount, I expect Windows NT will be multiuser only in the sense of sharing filesystems. Someone will likely write a telnetd for it so one could run character-based apps, but graphics-based apps will have to be shared by running the executables on the local CPU. This is how things are shaping up everywhere: client-server architectures are taking over from the old cpu-terminal setups.   Note that the NeXT does this: you can always telnet into a NeXT and run character-based apps but you can't run the GUI.

We know that early Christians suffered totures because of their witness to Christ.  For example:  ACT 5:40    His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had             them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of             Jesus, and let them go.  ACT 5:41    The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been             counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.  It appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion to even hearing Jesus's name. ACT 5:28    \\\"We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,\\\" he said.             \\\"Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are             determined to make us guilty of this man's blood.\\\"  Finally, the first apostle's death, James of Zebedee was certainly not by Rome's hand any more than the first martyr Stephen.     The problem was that if one believed in the Resurrection, then one must believe in Jesus as truly being the Son of God and what He stood for and preached during His ministry on Earth.  That would have been extremely difficult for some people, especially those that had plotted to kill Him.   \",\"Here is the OPI (Offensive Production Index) for all AL players with at least 10 at bats.

<Apr.15.00.58.22.1993.28891@athos.rutgers.edu>, by ruthless@panix.com (Ruth Ditucci):  I do hope that you are not suggesting that merely because a person replies in an \\\"acrid, angry and sarcastic\\\" manner that this demonstrates their 'non-christianity'?  The simple fact is that there is not a Christian on the face of the planet (that I know of!) that is perfect.  I have been known at times to have a fit of temper, or a sulk, but this does not make me any the less a Christian.  One of the points of being a Christian (as I perceive it) is to become MORE LIKE Christ.  This statement inherently suggests that we ARE NOT already like Christ.  Jesus never unrighteously lost his temper.  I do.  Jesus was perfect.  I'm not.   You must understand that this is because Christians often forget to treat others as our role-model - Christ - would.  This is because we are human and falible.  I, for one, do not pretend to be infalible, and I hope that my fellow-men will bear with me when I make mistakes.  This surely is not too much to ask, when I make every effort to bear with _them_.    And don't we know it!   Again I say, we are ALL human!  To my brethren, this:    Ms Duticci has a valid point and we as Christians ought to heed the warning in her article.  We oftimes discredit ourselves and our Saviour, in the way that we treat others.  Strive towards the goal set us by our Lord, but in the meantime, remember :       \\\"There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ...\\\"  When you blow it - go easy on yourself.  Forgive yourself, as your Father in heaven forgives you!  And remember - and this is something I firmly beieve and cling to - one day, we shall see Him face to face, and in that day, we shall (finally!) be perfected.    I look forward to seeing you there.

And anyway, humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts.   You are attaching too many things to the term \\\"moral,\\\" I think. Let's try this:  is it \\\"good\\\" that animals of the same species don't kill each other.  Or, do you think this is right?   Or do you think that animals are machines, and that nothing they do is either right nor wrong?    Those weren't arbitrary killings.  They were slayings related to some sort of mating ritual or whatnot.   Yes it was, but I still don't understand your distinctions.  What do you mean by \\\"consider?\\\"  Can a small child be moral?  How about a gorilla?  A dolphin?  A platypus?  Where is the line drawn?  Does the being need to be self aware?  What *do* you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals of the same species from (arbitrarily) killing each other?  Don't you find the fact that they don't at all significant?\",\"   It's about time.  Why do atheists spend so much time paying attention to the bible, anyway?  Face it, there are better things to do with your life!  I used to chuckle and snort over the silliness in that book and the absurdity of people believing in it as truth, etc.  Why do we spend so little time on the Mayan religion, or the Native Americans?  Heck, the Native Americans have signifigantly more interesting myths.  Also, what about the Egyptians.  I think we pay so much attention to Christianity because we accept it as a _religion_ and not a mythology, which I find more accurate.   I try to be tolerant.  It gets very hard when someone places a book under my nose and tells me it's special.  It's not.\",\"  [ ACT 5:40 - 41 ]  ... ...  The basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance on the biblical text.  Luke's account is highly suspect (I would refer you to the hermeneia commentary on Acts).  Moreover Luke's account is written at least 90 years after the fact.  In the meantime everyone he mentions has died and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established. Moreover, Pauls account of some of the events in Acts (as recorded in  Galatians) fail to establish the acts accounts.   What we need, therefore, is a reliable text, critically appreciated, which documents the death of Christians for belief in the Resurrection.  I would suggest you look at some greek and roman historians.  I think you will be disapointed.\",\" Crullerian.   Crullerian photography isn't educational, except in a purely satiric sense.   Crullerian photography involves putting donuts between grease-covered hot metal plates while illuminating them with a Krypton Stroboscope. Through a unique iteration involving the 4th-dimensional projection of a torus through the semi-stochastic interactions of hot monomolecular lipid layers covering the metal plates (the best metal is iron since it repels Vampires and Succubi) the donuts start developing flutes, and within moments actually become poly-crenellated hot greasy breadtubes. Some people believe that food is the way to a man's heart, but most psychics agree that there is nothing like hot Crullers for breakfast; the chemical composition of crullers is a mystery, some thought evidence of Charles Fort's channeling in Stevie Wonder's production of \\\"The Secret Life of Plants\\\" when played backwards in the theatre of unnaturally fertile Findhorn Farms has deduced that they are complex carbohydrates ordinarily only found by spectoscopy in the Magellenic Clouds. I called Devi on my Orgone Box and asked her if this was really the case, and she TM levitated me a letter across the Atlantic to tell me it was indeed not just another case of misunderstanding Tesla, though the Miskatonic University hasn't confirmed anything at all. At least the Crullers taste good; I got the recipe from Kaspar Hauser.     \",\"Hello--  I just bought a new portable CD player for the office, and I notice that it proudly proclaims \\\"8 TIMES OVERSAMPLING\\\" on the box.  Now while I think I understand what oversampling is (the rate of discrete \\\"samples\\\" exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor), I don't understand this \\\"8 TIMES\\\" business...  It seems to me that when I bought my first CD player (was it REALLY 10 years ago?!), the specs said \\\"4 TIMES\\\" ...  Could someone please tell me whether I'm getting senile?  If I'm not, then what good does it do for the player to take samples at a higher rate?  If I really wanted better fidelity, wouldn't I have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recording process?  Furthermore, am I wrong in interpreting the sampling rate (from the player's point of view) as being the same thing as the data rate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium?  Does this mean that the data rate (related to the rotational speed of the disk) has  changed since 1983?  I'm so confused...    --Cliff \",\"Well i'm not sure about the story nad it did seem biased. What I disagree with is your statement that the U.S. Media is out to ruin Israels reputation. That is rediculous. The U.S. media is the most pro-israeli media in the world. Having lived in Europe I realize that incidences such as the one described in the letter have occured. The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to ignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the Europeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think that might be a reason they report more clearly on the atrocities.  What is a shame is that in Austria, daily reports of the inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing received from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt go away. After all, look how the Jews are treating other races when they got power. It is unfortunate. \",\"It did it again.  This morning, my 88 Ford Ranger was idling at 10,000 RPM. Ok, so I exaggerated a little, but it was idling very fast.  It has a 2 liter carburated engine in it, and no blipping of the throttle would cause the idle to drop back to normal (I don't think the linkage is stuck). What can I do to fix this problem?  This has been a problem from time to time, but has straightened itself out - until now.

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they would call Japan, etc.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would greatly appreciate your sending it to me.

Slimy tactic.\",\"Yes, there is:  consumer confusion.  In the early 80's with the fuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage than comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their 350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big mistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine could not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with these cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer -- DON\\\"T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.  Ask yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving, LOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper in the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them? Trailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines? No, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a 500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.  I own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine. Just keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline engine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that  when they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350 engine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about $2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long and gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine costs about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection pump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again, you never need a tune-up.  If you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal. Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.\",\"THE ARMED CITIZEN +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Mere presence of a firearm, without a shot being fired, prevents crime in many instances, as shown by news reports sent to The Armed Citizen.

Thanks again -- \",\" Many people responded with more anecdotal stories; I think its safe to say the original poster is already familiar with such stories. Presumably, he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about MSG making people ill.   Similarly, debunking such claims without doing research (whether literature and lab), is equally beside the point. The original poster no doubt already knows that some people think 'Chinese Restaurant Syndrome' is bogus.  Placebos are all very interesting, but irrelevant to the question of what effects MSG has. You could have real effects *and* placebo effects; people may have allergies in addition.    Have you read Olney's work? I fail to see how citing results from peer-reviewed studies qualifies as \\\"bizarrely cracked\\\".   Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys, as well. I have never seen a study where the mode of administration was intra-ventricular.  The Glu and Asp were administered orally. Some studies used IV and SC. Intra-ventricular is not a normal admin. method for food tox. studies, for obvious reasons. You must not have read the peer-reviewed works that I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain injection bunk.   Pardon me, but where are you getting this from? Have you read the journals? Have you done a thorough literature search?  But, you're right, mice aren't the best to study this on. They're four times less sensitive than humans to MSG.   The point is exceeding the window. Of course, they're amino acids. Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine.  Olney's research compared infant human diets. Specifically, the amount of freely available Glu in mother's milk versus commercial baby foods, vs. typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged soup mixes. He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin for infant humans by at least four-fold in a single meal of processed foods. Mother's milk was well below the effective dose.    Between who? Over what? I would be most interested in seeing you provide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citations to articles disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever.

Canada is in no imminent danger of being overtaken as the primary  supplier of players...Sweden, Finland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia are all relatively small countries, and cannot really produce players at a greater rate than they are already producing them, and the potential influx from the former Soviet Union is severely blunted because the system has been raided and is starved for finances and will take a decade or two, to recover and become a real threat, and the US will just maintain its slow increase.  Canada should continue to supply 60% plus of the top hockey players in the world for the forseeable future.  Besides we need the European hockey market if hockey is to take its rightful place besides soccer as the two predominant world sports...and since soccer is essentially boring, unlike hockey.   Canadians are under no threat...the European numbers will soon saturate, if they haven't already...and by the time Russia comes online again, the NHL should be a world league, and there will be many more teams to stock and many more jobs for Canadian hockey players.  In the near team, the percentage of Canadians will mostly decline because of  Americans, not because of Europeans.

Generally, today people's `identity' on the internet is primarily   determined by their email address in the sense that this is their   most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm.   This is your   login name qualified by the complete address domain information,   for example ``ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu''.  People see   this address when receiving mail or reading USENET posts from you   and in other situations where programs record usage.  Some obsolete   forms of addresses (such as BITNET) still persist.    In email messages, additional information on the path that a message   takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient.  This   information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the   transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination.  This   type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET   protocol to a lesser extent.  Forging these fields requires   corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and   is very uncommon.  Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the   origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked   at the time the message is created.  Tracing these messages can be   difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of   real machines and represent real transfer routes.  _____ <1.2> Why is identity (un)important on the internet?    The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication,   privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of   computer networks. For example, the convenience of communication   afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for   identification.  But there are many potential abuses of identity   possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive   computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can   potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems.    Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication',   and one classic example of the problems associated with it is   H.G.Well's ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled   segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was   in progress.  Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and   forged identities makes them more insidious.  People and their   reputations can be assaulted by forgery.    However, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of   its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is   harmful.  A professor might carefully explain a topic until he   finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular   occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally   shun him.  Some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many   prejudices are useful!  A scientist might argue he can better   evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more   about the authors.  Likewise, he may be more likely to reject it   based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  On the other side of the   connection,  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in   exerting pressure for acceptance.    Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating   `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'.    Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques   for identification. Heavy reliance will be placed on digital   authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic.    Many government functions and services are based on identification,   and law enforcement frequently hinges on it.  Hence, employees of   many government organizations push toward stronger identification   structures.  But when does identification invade privacy?    The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive   proportions. Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect   many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly   global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or   adverse affects of these actions, intended and inadvertent,  will   literally be magnified exponentially.  _____ <1.3> How does my email address (not) identify me and my background?    Your email address may contain information that influences people's   perceptions of your background.  The address may `identify' you as   from a department at a particular university, an employee at a   company, or a government worker.  It may contain your last name,   initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both.  In   the US some are based on parts of social security numbers.  Others   are in the form 'u2338' where the number is incremented in the   order that new users are added to the system.    Standard internet addresses  also can contain information  on your   broad geographical location or nationhood.  However, none of this   information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all.  The   fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on   rather arbitrary organization, such as (mostly invisible) network   cabling distributions.  The only point to make is that early fields   in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names   or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as   continental domains).  Typically the first field is the name of the   computer receiving mail.    Gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an   inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise.  (For more   information, see the FAQs on email  addresses and known   geographical distributions below.)  However, UNIX utilities exist   to aid in the quest (see the question on this).    Common Suffixes   ---------------    .us    United States   .uk    United Kingdom   .ca    Canada   .fi    Finland   .au    Australia    .edu   university or college   .com   commercial organization   .org   'other' (e.g. nonprofit organization)   .gov   government   .mil   military site   _____ <1.4> How can I find out more about somebody with a given email address?    One simple way is to send email to that address, asking.  Another   way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e.   postmaster@address), although the postmaster's job is more to help   find user ID's of particular people given their real name and solve   mail routing problems.  The sysadmin (i.e. `root@address') may also   be able to supply information.  Users with related email address   may have information.  However, all of these methods rely on the   time and patience of others so use them minimally.    One of the most basic tools for determining identity over the   internet is the UNIX utility 'finger'.  The basic syntax is:      finger user@here.there.everywhere    This utility uses communication protocols to query the computer   named in the address for information on the user named.  The   response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may   be in any format.  Possible responses are as follows:    - A message `unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is     incorrect, two lines with no information and '???'.      - A message 'In real life: ???' in which case the receiving computer     could not find any kind of a match on the username. The finger     utility may return this response in other situations.      - A listing of information associated with multiple users. Some     computers will search only for matching user IDs, others will     attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all     actual full names of users kept in a local database.      At some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the   system with a `finger @address'.  In general this is often   considered weak security, however, because `attackers' know valid   user ID's to `crack' passwords.    More information on the fields returned by `finger' is given below.    More information on `finger' and locating people's email addresses   is given in the email FAQ (such as the WHOIS lookup utility).  Just   as you can use these means to find out about others, they can use   them to find out about you.  You can `finger' yourself to find out   what is publicly reported by your UNIX system about you.  Be   careful when modifying `finger' data; virtually anyone with   internet access worldwide can query this information.  In one   amazing case, the New York Times writer J. Markoff uncovered the   identity of R. Morris, author of the Internet Worm,  through   the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'.  See the book Cyberspace   by K. Hafner and J. Markoff.  _____ <1.5> Why is identification (un)stable on the internet?    Generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept   on the Internet for a variety of reasons.  One is the inherent   fluidity of `cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge   frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the `community'.    Most people remember faces and voices, the primary means of casual   identification in the 'real world'.  The arbitary and cryptic    sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are   not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique   identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on   multiple machines anywhere in the world.    Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances   that the messages in email and USENET are from who they appear to   be. A person's mailing address is far from an identification of an   individual.        - Anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password,     either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address     in the From: line.      - Email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as     they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations.     - As part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the From:     line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many     hackers.        The status and path information prepended to messages by   intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. In general, while   possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in   email.  Besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic   problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification   on the internet:    - Internet mail standards, described in RFC-822, are still evolving     rapidly and not entirely orderly.  For example, standards for     mail address `munging' or `parsing' tend to vary slightly between     sites and frequently mean the difference between finding     addresses and bouncing mail.      - Domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites,     and there are delays in the propagation of this data.      - Addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers     crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved     in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers'.       - A whole slew of problems is associated with  `nameservers'; if     they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even     the operation of what constitutes `updating' has different     interpretations at different sites.      The current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly   anachronistic in that they were created when the network was   somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the   traffic it now sees.  Today a large proportion of internet traffic   is email, comprising  millions of messages.  _____ <1.6> What is the future of identification on the internet?    Some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images   and voice messages  into mail and these will improve the sense of   community that comes from the familiarity of identification.   However, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts   of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises   in privacy.    Promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures'   and 'digital authentication' common (see below).  Also, the trend   in USENET standards is toward greater authentication of posted   information.  On the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity   (such as remailers) are forthcoming.  See below.   PRIVACY =======  _____ <2.1> What is `privacy' on the internet?    Generally, while `privacy' has multiple connotations in society and   perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to   mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the   data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do   not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches.  In other words,    others may obtain data associated with your account, but not   without your permission.  These ideas are probably both fairly   limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users   consider their private domains.  Some users don't expect or want   any privacy, some expect and demand it.  _____ <2.2> Why is privacy (un)important on the internet?    This is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing   passionate opinions.  On the internet, some take privacy for   granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent.   Most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the   illegal search and seizure clause of the U.S. constitution, adopted   by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws   prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). These   rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules   governing it.  However, the legal repercussions of the global   internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong   legal precedents and court cases).  The fact that internet traffic   frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not   centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly   discourages its regulation.  _____ <2.3> How (in)secure are internet networks?    - `Theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with     access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the     Internet  could potentially monitor or archive it. However, the     sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes     these scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies     with supposedly vast funding and resources.      - Technologies exist to `tap' magnetic fields given off by     electrical wires without detection.  Less obscurely, any machine     with a network connection is a potential station for traffic     detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to     very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even     possible.      - A company Network General Inc. is one of many that manufactures     and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can     'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for     troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is     prohibitive for casual use.    Known instances of the above types of security  breaches at a major   scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. The greatest risks   tend to emerge locally.  Note that all these approaches are almost   completely defused with the use of cryptography.      _____ <2.4> How (in)secure is my account?    By default, not very.  There are a multitude of factors that may   reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet.    First, your account must be secure from other users. The universal   system is to use a password, but if it is `weak' (i.e. easy to   guess) this security is significantly diminished.  Somewhat   surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain  users of the   system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited   access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to   others.  This means that they may read any file in your account   without detection.    Furthermore, not universally known, most UNIX systems keep fairly   extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what   commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login   information is usually public). Most features of this `auditing' or    `process accounting' information are enabled by default after the   initial installation and the system administrator may customize it   to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims.    This information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting   purposes and may otherwise be ignored.  This data tracks   unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on   the system. A traditional part of the UNIX system that tracks user   commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of   symbolic links (described  in 'man ln').      UNIX implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features   and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies   regularly. Typically system adminstrators augment the basic UNIX   functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed   tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate `suspicious'   activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the 'passwd' file, incorrect   login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.).      Generally, you should expect little privacy on your account for   various reasons:      - Potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by     someone else.     - System administrators make extensive backups that are completely     invisible to users which may record the states of an account over     many weeks.     - Erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted.     - Most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or     otherwise; for example FTP sites usually log the commands and     record the domain originations of users, including anonymous     ones.    - Some software exacerbates these problems.  See the section on     ``X Windows (in)security''.    Indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much   more commonly harmful threat. There are multiple ways to help   ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and   compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines:    - Choose a secure password.  Change it periodically.   - Make sure to logout always.   - Do not leave a machine unattended for long.   - Make sure no one watches you when you type your password.   - Avoid password references in email.   - Be conservative in the use of the .rhost file.   - Use utilities like `xlock' to protect a station, but be     considerate.    Be wary of situations where you think you should supply your   password.  There are only several basic situations where UNIX   prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or   changing your password.  Situations can arise in which prompts for   passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you   are talking to them (such as Internet Relay Chat).  Also, be  aware   that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain    passwords.     (Thanks to Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu> for contributions   here.)  _____ <2.5> How (in)secure are my files and directories?    The most important privacy considerations are related to file   rights, and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature   or haphazard maintenance. Be aware of the rights associated with   your files and directories in UNIX. If the `x' (`execute') right on   your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, these   users cannot gain information on anything in your directories.    Anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete   files in your home directory. The rights on a directory supersede   the rights associated with files in that directory. For a   directory, 'x' means that access to the files (or subdirectories)   in the directory is possible -- if you know their names.  To list   the contents of the directory, however, requires the 'r' right.     By default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the   initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator   preference.  The default file mode specifies the initial rights   associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell   with `umask'.  The details of rights implementations tend to vary   between versions of UNIX.  Consult man pages on `chmod' and `ls'.    Examples   --------      traver.lance % ls -ld ~     drwx------ 15 ld231782     1536 Jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/    Here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home   directory, denoted by `~'.  The columns at the left identify what   rights are available. The first column identifies the entry as a   directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and   execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user.  For   directories, the `x' right means that contents (file and   subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. The   subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to   anything in the directory tree originating at that point.  They   can't even `see' any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy   is completely invisible to them.      traver.lance % ls -l msg     -rw-r--r--  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg     traver.lance % chmod u=rw,g=,o= msg     traver.lance % ls -l msg     -rw-------  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg    Here the modes on the file `msg' were changed to take away rights   from `group' and `other'.       Note that `ls -l <file>' requires both the 'r' right to get the list   of files and subdirectories, and the 'x' right to access the files   and subdirectories in order to get their size, etc. For example,   suppose the directory `foo' has rights dr--r--r--,  the following   is possible:      ls foo    These commands would fail independent of file rights:        ls -l foo     ls -l foo/file     cat foo/file     cd foo    If the directory `foo' has rights d--x--x--x, the following are   possible if it is known beforehand that `foo' contains an 'r'   readable file named `file':        ls -l foo/file     cat foo/file     cd foo      The following commands fail:        ls foo     ls -l foo       (Thanks to Uwe Waldmann <uwe@mpi-sb.mpg.de> for contributions here.)  _____ <2.6> How (in)secure is X Windows?    X Windows is the primary software developed by the MIT Athena   project which is funded by U.S. government grants to develop   applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing   computational tasks, particularly the human-computer interface.    The software implements a client-server interface to a computer via   graphical windows. In this case the `client' is the application   requesting or utilizing  graphical resources (such as windows or a   mouse) and the `server' is the machine that provides them.  In many   situations the client is an application program running on the same   machine as the server.    The great utility of X Windows comes from its complete dissociation   of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast' to a   server at a remote location from the  client. Unfortunately this   dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated   security considerations.  The primary security and privacy issue   associated with X Windows is that much more sensitive data may be   sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where   the human is situated near the host computer.  Currently there is   no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in X   Windows.    Due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design   flaws,  early versions of the X Window system are extremely   insecure. Anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt   that display or read it electronically based on access to the   device unix:0.0 by any regular user.   There are no protections   from this type of access in these versions.   The problem arises   because the security is completely based on machine addresses   rather than users, such that any user at a `trusted' machine is   himself trusted. Quoting from X documentation (man Xsecurity):      > Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed   > access to the X server. This system can work reasonably well in   > an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a   > single person can log into a given machine...This system does not   > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and   > mutual trust does not exist.       With the access control list, the `xhost' command may prevent some   naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0   evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is  ``xhost   +[name]'' where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an   authorized client machine. By default clients running nonlocal to   the host are disabled.  Public domain programs to disrupt a display   momentarily (such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image, or   cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom) have been circulating on   the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks   on unsuspecting or inexperienced users.  Much more serious security   breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this   inherent weaknesses.  (The minimal, easily-bypassed `trusted'   security mode of `xhost' has been jokingly referred to as ``X   Hanging Open, Security Terrible.'').     New versions of the X Window system (X11R5 and higher) by default    make server access as secure as the file system using a .Xauthority   file and 'magic cookies'.  Remote machines must have a code in the   .Xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code   allowed by the server.  Many older programs and even new   vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with   `magic cookies'. The basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to   monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of   keys occurs in transmission.  X11R5 also includes other   sophisticated encryption mechanisms.  Try `man Xsecurity' to find   out what is supported at your site.  Even though improved security    mechanisms have been available in X Windows since ~1990, local   sites often update this software infrequently because installation   is extremely complex.     (Thanks to Marc Vanheyningen <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>,    Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu>, and Bill Marshall   <marshall@cs.iastate.edu> for contributions here.)  _____ <2.7> How (in)secure is my email?    By default, not very.  The characters that you are reading are   almost certainly encoded in ASCII, the American Standard Code for   Information Interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic   characters onto numeric codes and vice versa.  Virtually every   computer system uses this code, and if not, has ways of converting   to and from it.  When you write a mail message, by default it is   being sent in ASCII,  and since the standard is virtually   universal, there is no intrinsic privacy.  Despite milleniums worth   of accumulated cryptographic knowledge, cryptographic technologies   are only recently being established that afford high priority to   privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design.  Some   potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows:    - The most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous     system operators reading private mail in the `spool files' at a     local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message),     such as a university.       - System administrators may also release files to law enforcement     agencies, but conventions and protocols for warrants involving     computer searches have still not been strongly established and     tested legally.    - Note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in     their entirety.  This means that if you address mail with an     incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human     other than the recipient.    - Typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local     mail directory is private, but this is not guaranteed and can be     overridden.    - Finally, be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of      everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail      routing software mechanisms.  This `feature' can be disabled.    Most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly   avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography, which has   its own set of caveats (for example, unscrupulous administrators   may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or   nonlocal).  See the sections on ``email privacy'' and ``email   policies.''  _____ <2.8> How am I (not) liable for my email and postings?    As punishment or whatever, your system administrator can revoke   certain `privileges' such as emailing, USENET posting or reading   certain groups, file transferring, remote communications, or   generally any subset of capabilities available from your account.    This all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator   and under the procedures followed at a particular site, which in   many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented.  Currently there are   virtually no widespread, uniform guidelines or procedures  for   restricting use to any internet services, and local administrators   are free to make arbitrary decisions on access.    Today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations.   In the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator   regarding abuses by a user, usually but not necessarily preceded by   complaints to the user in email, regarding that person's   objectionable email or postings.  `abusive' posters to USENET are   usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as   urged by others on the `net'. (The debate persists endlessly on   many newsgroups whether this is also used  as a questionable means   of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots' or censoring   unpopular opinions.)      System administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to   'squelch' severe cases of abuse.  In general, however, by tradition   Usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of   the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe   their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options   wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next   message (referred to as ``hitting the `n' key''), or to `plonk'   annoying posters (according to the Hacker's Dictionary, the sound a   jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file).    In cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system   administrators are least likely to restrict email.  USENET postings   are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or    entire groups (such as a university campus).  Restrictions are most   commonly associated with the following `abuses':    - harassing or threatening notes, `email terrorism'   - illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material   - `ad hominem' attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the     poster instead of citing the content of the message   - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness   - inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups     `mail-bombing': inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive     files    Major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and   official email or postings.  Most users have internet access via   accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the   internet can be construed as representative of their parent   organizations. Many people put disclaimers in their `signatures' in   an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent   organizations as a precaution. A recent visible political case   involves the privacy of electronic mail  written by White House   staff members of the Bush administration.  Following are some   guidelines:    - Acquaint yourself with your company or university policy.   - If possible, avoid use of your company email address for private     communication.   - Use a disclaimer.   - Keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars' or simply don't post).   - Avoid posting information that could be  construed to be     proprietary or `internal'.    The following references are available from ftp.eff.com   (see also the section on ``internet use policies''):    /pub/academic/banned.1991   /pub/academic/banned.1992   ---     Computer material that was banned/challenged in academia in 1991     and 1992 including USENET hierarchies.    /pub/academic/cases   ---     This is an on-line collection of information about specific     computers and academic freedom cases. File README is a detailed     description of the items in the directory.    /pub/academic/faq/netnews.liability   ---     Notes on university liability for Usenet.  _____ <2.9> How do I provide more/less information to others on my identity?    The public information of your identity and account is mostly   available though the UNIX utility `finger' described above.       - You have control over most of this information with the utility     `chfn', the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use     `passwd -f').       - You can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is     copied directly to the destination during the fingering.         - A technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is     'finger'ing you and even to  vary the .plan file sent to them.        - Your signature is determined by the environment variable SIGNATURE        - USENET signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file     in your home directory.        Providing less information on your online identity is more difficult   and involved.  One approach is to ask your system adminstrator to   change or delete information about you (such as your full name).    You may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from   someone unrelated to you personally.  You may be able to remotely   login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not   physically near.  These are tactics for hiding or masking your   online activities but nothing is foolproof.  Consult man pages on   the 'chmod' command and the default file mode.  Generally, files on   a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very   little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators.    To mask your identity in email or on USENET you can use different   accounts. More untraceable are new `anonymous posting' and   remailing services that are very recently being established.  See   below.  ______ <2.10> Who is my sysadmin?  What does s/he know about me?    The requirements and screening for getting a system administration   job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely   between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at   universities.  Many UNIX systems at universities are largely   managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often   `hacking'.  In general, commercial and industrial sites are more   strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are   extremely strict.    The system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you   used and at what times.  S/he may have a record (backups) of files   on your account over a few weeks. S/he can monitor when  you send   email or post USENET messages, and potentially read either.  S/he   may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using,   both locally and elsewhere.  Administrators sometimes employ   specialized programs to  track `strange' or `unusual' activity,   which can potentially be misused.  ______ <2.11> Why is privacy (un)stable on the internet?    For the numerous reasons listed above, privacy should not be an   expectation with current use of the internet.  Furthermore, large   parts of the internet are funded by the U.S. NSF (National Science   Foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as   prohibiting commercial use).  Some high-level officials in this and   other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to   guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services).    Historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been   local. Perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread   occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some   portion of USENET newsgroups labelled as `pornographic'. The   `alternative' hierarchy in the USENET system, which has virtually   no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is   frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere).    From the global point of view traffic is generally completely   unimpeded on the internet  and only the most egregious offenders   are pursued.  For example,  verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted   material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to   USENET with regularity without major consequences (some email   complaints may ensue).  More astonishing to some is that currently   significant portions of USENET traffic, and less so internet   traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost   entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as   `alt.sex' regularly have the  highest traffic).    ______ <2.12> What is the future of privacy on the internet?    Some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or   appropriate level of privacy.  Others will argue that as a   prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate   safeguards.  The internet is growing to become a completely global,   international superhighway for data, and this traffic will   inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and   many other items of extremely personal nature. Computer items that   many people consider completely private (such as their local hard   drives) will literally be inches from global network connections.   Also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged   over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with   the internet.      Most would agree that, for these basic but sensitive uses of the   internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to   ensure much privacy. New standards are calling for uniform   introduction of `privacy enhanced mail' (PEM) which uses encryption   technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is   automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards.    The same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy   (such as with  surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly   effective in protecting  it (e.g. with encryption). Some government   agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe   that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct   (e.g. court-authorized wiretapping).  However, powerful new   technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming   increasingly popular, provoking some to say that ``the cat is out   of the bag'' and the ``genie can't be put back in the bottle''.  In   less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong   cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically   unstoppable.      To date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure   communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two   goals are largely incompatible). Proposals for ``registration'' of   secret keys (by D. Denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met   with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst,   mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections   of inherent feasibility.  Electronic privacy issues, and   particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will   foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few   years.   ANONYMITY =========  _____ <3.1> What is `anonymity' on the internet?    Simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the   ultimate in privacy. However, there are several variations on   this simple theme.  A person may wish to be consistently   identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle' and establish a   reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity.   A person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single   one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run'). Or, a person may   wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with   others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an   `anonymous return address'.  A user may wish to appear as a   `regular user' but actually be untraceable.  Sometimes a user   wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the   message itself). The anonymous item itself may be directed at   individuals or groups.  A user may wish to access some   service and hide all  signs of the association.       All of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently   tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking   mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols.    Officials of the NSF and other government agencies may be opposed   to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse.    Nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will   always guarantee a certain element of anonymity.  _____ <3.2> Why is `anonymity' (un)important on the internet?    Anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or   problematic depending on its use.  Arguably absence of   identification is important as the presence of it.  It may be the   case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be   discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true   anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish.    One can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague   that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as   employer/employee scenarios).  One can use it to pass information   and evade any threat of direct retribution.  For example,   `whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses (economic, social,   or  political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or   retaliation. Sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information   is often posted to some USENET groups, a risky situation where   anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely   independent of the identities of the participants.  Some police   departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of   crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network.   Unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with   assurances of anonymity.  _____ <3.3> How can anonymity be protected on the internet?    The chief means, as alluded to above, are masking identities in   email and posting. However, anonymous accounts (public accounts as   accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be   effective as well, but this use is generally not officially   supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and NSF   guidelines.  The nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining   accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous   accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large.    Many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to   anonymity.  Virtually every protocol in existence currently   contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet.   New communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee   much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication.  _____ <3.4> What is `anonymous mail'?    One approach to `anonymizing' mail has been to set up an `anonymous   server' that, when activated by email to its address, responds by   allocating and supplying an `anonymous ID' that is unique to the   person requesting it (based on his email address).  This will vary   for the same person for different machine address email   originations. To send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed   to the server containing the final destination. The server   `anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information   and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the   anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id.    This is the `interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity   mentioned above.    Another more `fringe' approach is to run a `cypherpunk' remailer   from a regular user account (no root system privileges are   required). These are currently being pioneered by  Eric Hughes and   Hal Finney <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>. The operator runs a process on   a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain   characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail   (typically fields in the header). One has been implemented as a    PERL script running on UNIX.  Several of these are in existence   currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable;   they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge.   The remailers don't generally support anonymous return addresses.    Mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator.    Generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any   responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system,   although actually may be held liable regardless.    These approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses:      - The anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of     anonymous ID's to real addresses that must be maintained     indefinitely.  One alternative is to allow `deallocation' of     aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been     implemented yet.    - Although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could     conceivably be monitored from the `outside', necessitating the     use of cryptography for basic protection,.    - Local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or     under pressure from local, network, or government agencies.      - Unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic     that goes through them.    - Most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected.     - The cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these     operators are basically  network users who do not own the     equipment and are accountable  to their own system     administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic     to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered,     regarding it as illicit use.     - In all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous     server operator by the user.    Currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using SMTP   protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary   field information.  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the   approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by   most system administrators.  Information in the header routing data   and logs of network port connection information may be retained   that can be used to track the originating site.  In practice, this   is generally infeasible and rarely carried out.  Some   administrators on the network will contact local administrators to   request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished   more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually   happening occasionally but infrequently.    See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and    ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.  _____ <3.5> What is `anonymous posting'?    Anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous Usenet   posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic,   capricious or risky local circumstances, logging).  Make sure to   test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to   misc.test (however some operators don't recommend this because many   sites `autorespond' to test messages, possibly causing the   anonymous server to allocate anonymous IDs for those machines).    See the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting''   before proceeding.    Another direct route involves using NNTP protocols to submit a   message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information.   This practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed   with hostility by most system administrators, and similar   consequences can ensue.    See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and    ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.  _____ <3.6> Why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet?    As noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available   to the general internet community, and these services should be   used with great caution.  To summarize, the technology is in its   infancy and current approaches are unrefined, unreliable, and not   completely trustworthy.  No standards have been established and   troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software   are prevalent.  Here are some encountered and potential bugs:       - One  anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous     return addresses.    - Others passed signature information embedded in messages     unaltered.    - Address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced     to a remailer are common.   - Forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem,  possibly     allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon ID - email     address  mappings in the alias file.  This can be remedied with     the use of passwords.   - Infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers.      Source code is being distributed, tested, and refined for these   systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly.  The   field is not likely to improve considerably without  official   endorsement and action by network agencies.  The whole idea is   essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and   distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable   to criminality.  The major objection to anonymity over regular   internet use  is the perceived lack of accountability to system   operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting   from outside complaints.  System adminstrators at some sites have   threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the   prominent servers from their redistribution flows.  This may only   have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less   characteristically detectable headers.  Probably the least   problematic approach, and the most traditional to Usenet, is for   individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer,   e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files.    _____ <3.7> What is the future of anonymity on the internet?    New anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase   safeguards of anonymity.  For example, the same mechanism that   routes email over multiple hosts, thereby threatening its privacy,   can also be used to guarantee it. In a scheme called `chaining' an   anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers   before reaching a destination.  In this way generally multiple   links of the chain have to be `broken' for security to be   compromised. Re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even   more unlikely.  Even more significantly the anonymous remailers   could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses   (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation)   would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message   tracing. However, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible.      The future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time,   highly uncertain and fraught with peril. While specific groups seem   to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many   feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a   disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in   `serious' groups.   The introduction of unlimited group anonymity   may have fundamental repercussions on Usenet conventions and   distribution mechanisms such as moderated and `alt' groups have had   in the past. For example, as part of new group creation, the   charter may specify whether `anonymous' posting is (un)welcome.     Nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may   be inevitable. Based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are   in huge demand. Pervasive and readily available anonymity could   carry significant and unforeseen social consequences.  However, if   its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may   be confined to the underground.  The ramifications of widespread   introduction of anonymity to Usenet are still largely unknown. It   is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new   traffic or, instead of expansion, cause a shift where a greater   portion of existing traffic is anonymized.  Conceivably the   services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social   acceptance of Usenet.   * * *\",\"l   diamond star cars (Talon/Eclipse/Laser) put out 190 hp in the turbo models, and 195 hp in the AWD turbo models,  These cars also have handling to match the muscle, and are civil in regular driving conditions, rather than having a harsh, stiff ride....The AWD Turbo is clearly the better choice of the two (because of all that torque steer on the front drive model), but you may have to go with a leftover or \\\"slightly\\\" used model for that price range....tough decision...

It is supposed to look like a sideways smiley-face, and indicates that the preceding comment is supposed to be funny.   And, I'll note that I have participated on talk.religion.misc for over five years -- I'd say Mr Siemon was not too far off.  8^)   *  In the meat of his reply, Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of what I meant by \\\"There is no way out of the loop\\\".  I wrote that human brains \\\"are infested with sin\\\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.    Which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your conscience is properly formed?  The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the formed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure that your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation can be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll grant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.  Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be certain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is `properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)   Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:   The Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation? How do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or another -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?  You write:   But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I am confident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way from `confident'.  This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain (really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is significantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that you are confident, that invites people to ask why.  Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely certain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any idea of his own fallibility.   I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of truth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of them -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible. The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.   Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu  [This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the original criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster regarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong answers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal consequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is at least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that -- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are fallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these basic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's unlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of confidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as to sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, for example said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell, and I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a feeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and intolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's some chance I'm wrong.  Don't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant Christians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least some cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger. If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for certain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way I think it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that way.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most difficult to respond to.  But it's not arrogance for me to tell what I think is the truth.\",\"(quoting someone else here)            Yeah!

Wouldn't that just be too bad? \",\"While not exactly a service incident, I had a similar experience recently   when I bought a new truck.  I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we   agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.   When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could   get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he   started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had   miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed   another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was   their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then   brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I   reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be   treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole   deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,   snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by   the turn of events.  Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting   to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and   asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him   that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,   that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs   and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still   pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to   lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told   him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.  A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all   apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus   knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about   it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,   and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....  I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we   decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him   back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the   truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the   incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of   there in my new truck in about 30 mins.  So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not   have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales   person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I   sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their   mistake.  Anyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred   dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.   I'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.\",\" At issue was not a trial behind closed doors, but arrest, trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy.  This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason to believe it still goes on.  Read this:  From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992  PUBLICATION BAN          The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many         years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were         sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of         their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever         being made public.  By Baruch Me'iri  All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way or another: \\\"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published\\\".  The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest, and later on their imprisonment.  In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of this country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison, for security offenses, in complete secrecy.  In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA] affair -- we heard about \\\"the third man\\\" being in prison.  But many years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former Communist countries.  But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.  The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:  \\\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner\\\", asserts MK Zucker.  On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \\\"There is absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public.  \\\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\\\"  Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question.  \\\"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret\\\", wrote Zucker.  The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that, \\\"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter\\\".  \\\"The Union is aware\\\", says Shiffman, \\\"of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.  \\\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy...\\\"  Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible.  \\\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it.\\\"  -- Do you find this situation acceptable?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand, though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least are aware of his imprisonment.\\\"  -- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the discretion of the court?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which they can misuse.\\\"  -- And what if there really is a security issue?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.  Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public.\\\"  Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  \\\"A healthy situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security\\\".  A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir.  \\\"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.  \\\"Nevertheless\\\", adds Shtendal, \\\"the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned. The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\\\"  Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \\\"As a rule, clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances.\\\"\",\"I have a video board for sale for Macintosh NU-Bus machines.  My other deal fell through.  I am asking $200.

Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of religion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a \\\"real\\\" story (that is, a bigger headline).  Let's back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the various targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the Septuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the standard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has obvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy. These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and to the Septuagint.  Now, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars: first, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are variant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to \\\"fixing\\\"/predating the various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of my knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and have little theological import.  The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of Isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There is also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the septuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations between the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the septuagint, where the latter isn't obviously in error.  Again, though, the differences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the material, but so far this hasn't happened.  The DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the OT, unlike for the NT.\",\"Davis will be paid by three clubs this year, I think the Phils are responsbible for about $600,000 or so.

Mark's comment still is valid.  To suggest that AIDS is \\\"deserved\\\" IS ludicrous.  I sin.  I can resolve to abstain from  sin, and do weekly (more often, actually).  Yet I routinely fail. I surely do deserve what I get, yet God compassionately provided  the Incarnate Logos, Jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation. If AIDS is deserved, I surely deserve instant death just as much, as do we all, as St. Paul so cogently remids us.  To willingly judge \\\"others\\\" as deserving punishment seems to me to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.      So what's the point here?  I can get AIDS and NEVER engage in \\\"deviant\\\" sexual behavior.  In fact, I could engage in LOTS of deviant sexual behavior with HIV+ people and never be infected.  AIDS is a consequence of particular behaviors, many of which are not sexual.  And not all sexual behaviors carry the risk of transmission.      The end of all things is to know, love and serve God, growing daily closer through prayer, meditation and discipline.  Even so I could get AIDS.

Thanks, Pat \",\"I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of mite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a lot of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years (since we moved to N.C.).  Here are some observations gained from painful experience:    1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.      Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more      sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.    2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear      that these things will itch for months.    3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of      it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,      since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could      find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special      collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is      required to get it.    4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old      folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall      reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers      burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I      think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some      sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.    5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.      A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally      applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is      another preparation called \\\"Chig Away\\\" that is a combination of      sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was      prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In      the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get      up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we      live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They      apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur      as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)    6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget      the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment      that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone      creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine      (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.      Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this      counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think      it gains nothing).    7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved      by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery      as well.  Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money.\",\"  Anyone who dies for a \\\"cause\\\" runs the risk of dying for a lie.

Firstly, what do you exactly mean by \\\"fundamentalist\\\"?  I will for the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes that the bible is God's word to mankind?  I suspect that what happened to him is what he'll call being \\\"born again\\\"?  Anyway, was that recent? If the answer is \\\"yes\\\" to all the questions above, it is quite understandable.  However, IMO, I'ld rather give advice to your friend! I think I've been through something similar to him, and one thing I can say is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to communicate from different worldviews.  Why he talks about those things is because they are now \\\"obvious\\\" to him.  What is \\\"obvious\\\" to him is not obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because from his point of view, he has been on \\\"both sides of the fence\\\".  This I mean that before he turned \\\"fundamentalist\\\", you two are agreeable because both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as if a new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the discovery of let's say a new continent, or a new planet.  To him, he's got to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than where he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now. You have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to you, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth that risk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand and listen to you as well.  At this moment, it may be difficult because he is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about, however, he may not realise that he's really putting you off.  [...]   So far, I've only been trying to explain things from his side.  However, I do understand how you feel too, because I wasn't a Christian for a good part of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or \\\"fundamentalists\\\" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their faith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately, \\\"religious belief\\\" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism is also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is inevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise), it will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take both sides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you can do your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he's trying to convince you about, that it's beyond you or not your concern \\\"for now\\\".  Don't tell him it's nonsense, because to him it is reality - and that would be a real insult.  He'll also have to be careful not to insult where you stand too.  Like I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too. I'll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a Christian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little differently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited and just blabbered away about what I've found!  To me, it was too good not to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didn't really care most of the time what they thought.  You will probably think he's crazy too - but God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in mind.  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real to him, he doesn't see why God can't be real to you too.  I don't know how helpful this is to you.  But all the best anyhow - this is quite a challenge for you to face.

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) rocket ship.          The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in mid-June.          Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for SSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60 million for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a follow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies.          SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent changes in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO less of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as a step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.          SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies, said Col.  Simon \\\"Pete\\\" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program. \\\"I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I have available to spend,\\\" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell Douglas Astronautics headquarters.          While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital objective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the \\\"better, faster, cheaper\\\" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that \\\"leapfrog\\\" ahead of evolutionary technology developments.          Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a \\\"build a little, test a little\\\" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said the program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months -- showed how today's engineers could move beyond the \\\"miracles of our parents' time.\\\"          \\\"The key is management,\\\" Worden said. \\\"SDIO had a very light hand on this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.\\\"          Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be crucial. \\\"It's essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially.\\\"          SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee. \\\"This is the direction we're going to have to go,\\\" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee's Democratic chairman. \\\"Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't sustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has.\\\"          Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further. Joking that \\\"a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,\\\" Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency.          Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell Douglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. \\\"Let's not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!\\\"           Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.          McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its C-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment. \\\"On very large ventures, companies put in seed money,\\\" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas' senior vice president for space systems. \\\"You need strong government investments.\\\"          While the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas Aircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).          Flight tests this summer at White Sands will \\\"expand the envelope\\\" of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle take-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to 5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000 feet.          Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.

It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid turnaround.          Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ tri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union. The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.\",\" Once the chips are released (in phones, or whatever), they are vulnerable to  phsyical inspection and observation.

They tend to be the very good second line guys- who would be first liners on most weaker clubs in the NHL. They were all important to their clubs.  Probably, several of these Stanley Cup winning teams would not have won the cups they did if it were not for the depth provided by these players.  They compare to Rick Tocchet and Ron Francis of the Penguins.  Very good players who can lead lesser teams (Francis-Hartford, Tocchet-Philly) who provide the depth to the team that is currently best in the NHL.  As a defensive forward, there have been none better than Bob Gainey.  That doesn't mean he was the best player (or even the best forward) the Canadians had at that time, but he was excellent at what he did.  Gainey could dominate games with his defence.

The Subject:  After-market cruise controls  The Background: I recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five  screws, yuk! :-( ).  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my home) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to drive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of a good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do all the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.  My question: What is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I realize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a thing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of accuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle.  I have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with kettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not electronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying to give information as completly as I can).  I found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system  instead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy this CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?  It has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the  negative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I understand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read it in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but harder to install.  Is there really a big difference?  It has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a sensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which would wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned  the thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it were for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.  The installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal and a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm not sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what exactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it?  I think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative side tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and all that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:   1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a      device?  2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?  3.  Are \\\"professionally\\\" installed CCs signifacantly better and      worth the cabbage?  4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just      that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple       needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,      the questions above)?  My father and I built a \\\"Veep\\\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in high school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and cars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain that I get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my Veep. :-)  I appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.

Thus, in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when  people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and  where accusations of witchcraft were not made.

It may not use the exact words as quoted above but I'm sure many will agree that the same message is being issued.  Later on when I get back home I will try to find the precise section(s) but you can do the research for now (I hope).  I also realize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_ *to the Western media only* but he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact intentions on this issue.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_ still stands as the \\\"Bible\\\" (so to speak) of the mainstream Palestinian National movement!    As a staunch pro-Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT influenced my opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As I mentioned above, just a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar conclusion on the Palestinian National movement (the PLO in most cases).  BB does not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share my views.   What 1948 situation?  A negative situation I presume?  Is this the same \\\"situation\\\" when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the Jews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM?  Was this an example of Qu'ranic law being exercised?  If not, I have another suggested reading for you... get into the \\\"soc.culture.arabic\\\" newsgroup where the posters have been debating the topic \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" (and may I remind you the people doing the debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran). You will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran (to put it lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will be treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran?  I think the 1948-1967 \\\"situation\\\" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you think?   All I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" and think again.  \\\"Freedom of choice\\\" is *definitely* not an option in Qu'ranic law especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I'm sure you saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic state).   Probably nothing!  Aside from how to break the news to his Palestinian brethren that the _Covenant_ is \\\"null and void\\\" without getting assassinated himself!   In conclusion, Ahmed, you should go to the library and find the _Palestinian National Covenant (1964)_ and read it VERY CAREFULLY.

Simply, Windows seems to only support mice on COM1 or COM2. The funny part is, though, that Microsoft's own mouse driver (8.xx) was quite happy with my mouse sitting on COM3. Why can't Windows use the mouse driver, or at least support COM3? :-)   I've tried this too. Actually, I wanted to be able to use my second modem (COM3/IRQ5) from Windows. It still will not talk to that modem. I created two profiles, AMSTRAD (for my Amstrad modem on COM1/IRQ4) and MAESTRO (for my Maestro on COM3/IRQ5). It will not talk to the Maestro at all.   Nor here. (Windows 3.0).   I've seen nothing like that. I've experimented with Logitech's mouse driver too, with no sucess.   If you have a SoundBlaster Pro, it should support IRQ10 as well. Finally, a board that supports IRQs >9. The only one I have (except my IDE controller).  hamish \",\"  The NASM photo archives are open to the public.  All (or almost all) still pictures in the collection are available for viewing, but I don't know about films.  At least it might be worth a try.

Koresh was calling the shots.  He was  talking with his lawyer and the FBI.  Since others were released safely,  there is no sane reason for keeping the children inside the compound.   Not at all.  Are you a Koresh worshiper?   Thanks for my laugh of the day!  Definitely a very silly supposition.   I would if I could.  The news show that showed the lengthy excerpts also  had interviews with the filmmaker who made the documentary who basically  confirmed what was shown in the excerpts from the time he spent at the  compound in 1992.   I believe that this was reported by local radio reporters on site. A fire started in a three story tower at the same time as the two  story window shown on the tv coverage.   I thought about mentioning how Reagan and the military treated the press  in Grenada and how that set the precedent, but decided it wasn't worthy  of discussion.  If the news reporter got shot, you can bet his family  would sue the government for letting him into the danger area.  The root cause of suspicion in my mind is why 100 people wouldn't flee  a building that had numerous exits during the 30 minutes time it took  to burn down.  Or why didn't they flee hours earlier when the tear gas was  first introduced?

Dave Schabel   \",\"FYI...I just posted this on alt.psychoactives as a response to what the group is for......   A note to the users of alt.psychoactives....  This group was originally a takeoff from sci.med.  The reason for the formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive drugs....such as antidepressents(tri-cyclics, Prozac, Lithium,etc), antipsychotics(Melleral(sp?), etc), OCD drugs(Anafranil, etc), and so on and so forth.  It didn't take long for this group to degenerate into a psudo alt.drugs atmosphere.  That's to bad, for most of the serious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place have left and gone back to sci.med, where you have to cypher through hundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive data.  It was also to discuss real-life experiences and side effects of the above mentioned.  Oh well, I had unsubscribed to this group for some time, and I decided to check it today to see if anything had changed....nope....same old nine or ten crap articles that this group was never intended for.

OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,     and distribution.  Digital immortality.  The basic idea behind \\\"digital immortality\\\" is that computer networks    are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be there...and someone will dig them up.     If that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is  breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will  travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.   Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and  let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption... that's what they're here for.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  WHERE?               OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.       141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site     sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite   (you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)  Merely \\\"anonymous FTP\\\" to either site on Internet and change to the appropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the \\\"bin\\\" command to make sure you're in binary.  OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North America....the following systems have a substancial supply of OTIStuff...  Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines  CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron  --------------------------------------------------------------   HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?                What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely    photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me (email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received, it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works are also welcome.  OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.   GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to  see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at  most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit tougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,   you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change     JPG files to a standard GIF format.   OTIS also accepts animation files.        When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You  can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of  emailing).  If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send copies to:  The OTIS Project c/o Ed Stastny PO BX 241113 Omaha, NE 68124-1113  I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will   scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.   Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line  description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what the images are to be named, include those as well.     Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please contact me and we'll arrange things.  If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\\\" disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back. This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP, but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or JPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather not have to.  At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they can stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to  get a slab-o-OTIS.  As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.   Email me for current archive size and directory.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  DISTRIBUTION?  The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely    on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local  bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the appropriate text files along with the images.     It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.  It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite BBS system....or even just post this \\\"info-file\\\" there.  It would be keen of you.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  USE?  If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory, you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the  stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or full address credit).  You will either find this in the \\\".rm\\\" file for     the image or series of images...or in the \\\"Artists\\\" directory under the  Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have  to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for  you, or give you their contact information.   When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  NAMING IMAGES?  Please keep the names of your files in \\\"dos\\\" format.  That means, keep the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or four digit \\\"code\\\" for the series of images, plus the series number. Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something like:    ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC  Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems.     ----------------------------------------------------------------------   CREATING IMAGE FILES?  When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in case they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title, address or other information you'd like people to know.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  HMMM?!  That's about it for now.  More \\\"guidelines\\\" will be added as needed. Your input is expected.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS          (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,       or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations       however.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original         image files.  The files will go to the public at large.         It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone       could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.             Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS       takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights       revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to        give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed        electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed            all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is       NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or       broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not        limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,               screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific       permission for this sort of usage.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Remember, the operative term is \\\"stimulate\\\".

In order to turn the spacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be available, or you need to retrain a new team.  Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed. Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA  series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set. Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a \\\"standby\\\" mode for use in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is still required to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is relatively cheap.  Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance to stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin- stabilized control mode because it would require little power or  maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time to time.  In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money), but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.\",\"In the past, I have used named pipes to communicate between processes using the XtAddInput function to set up the event handling in Motif.

My brother was living with someone like that and things were almost as bad (although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due to other problems with the relationship).  Anyway, the best thing to do would be to get everyone in the same room together (optimally in a room with nothing breakable), lock the door behind you, throw the key out underneath the door (just as far as the longest hand can reach.  You would like to get out after the conclusion, I would imagine), and hash things out.  More than likely, there will be screaming, crying, and possibly hitting (unless of course someone decided to bring some rope to tie people down).  Some of the best strategies in keeping things calmer would include:    have each individual own their own statements (ie, I feel that this relationship is hurting everyone involved because.... or I really don't understand where you're coming from.)    reinforce statements by paraphrasing, etc. (ie, So you think that we did this because of...?  Well, let me just say that the reason for this was ....)    don't accuse each other (It was your fault that ... happened!)    find a common ground about SOMETHING (Lampshades really are decorational and functional at the same time.)    Guaranteed, in a situation like this, there is going to be some gunnysacking (re-hashing topics which were assumed resolved, but were truly not and someone feels someone else is to blame).  However, this should be kept to a minimum and simply ask for forgiveness or apologize about each situation WITHOUT holding a smoldering grudge.    The relationship really can work.  It's just a matter of keeping things smooth and even.  It's sort of like making a peace treaty between warring factions:  you can't give one side everything; there must be a compromise.  Breaks can be taken, but communication between everyone involved must continue if the relationships here are to survive.\",\"    The F550iW is optimized for Windows.

They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan- ger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the  physical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had  an awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas ornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this  went on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and  was in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into tears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .  Then someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I  want to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am  silent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling me, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the one whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place,  telling him, \\\"I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring  her corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse.\\\" He went and returned empty handed, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his  apartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were  walking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls.  There was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.  They started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I  went down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the apartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be  cowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the  doors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth,  opened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle  Sabir's son started to shout, \\\"Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!\\\" He  knocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma.  Aunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their  apartment. I didn't see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying delirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother. All of my family had gathered there.     At the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the apartment.  Later I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, \\\"Lyuda,  Karina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. If she recognizes  you, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful.\\\" It was as though her whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one  side, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her  cheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole microdistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. I said, \\\"Fine.\\\" Mamma was  afraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started  to cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the bed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye  that was intact, looked at me, and said, \\\"Who is it?\\\" But I could barely talk,  my whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say, but rather muttered something tender, something incomprehensible, but tender, \\\"My Karochka, my Karina, my  little golden one . . . \\\" She understood me.  Then Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips.  She started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn't  understand it. Then I made out, \\\"It hurts, I hurt all over.\\\" Her hair was  glued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her  forehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don't know how  to help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She's saying something to me, but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil  and paper and says, \\\"Write it down.\\\" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I  can't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me  something, but she couldn't. I say, \\\"Karina, just lie there a little while, then maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then.\\\" And then she says, \\\"Maybe it'll be too late.\\\" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn't control myself.  Then I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She  says, \\\"Lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this  damned house. They want to kill us, I know. They'll find us here, too. We need to call Urshan.\\\" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I  understood her every word. I ask, \\\"What's his number?\\\" Urshan Feyruzovich,  that's the head of the administration where she works. \\\"We have to call him.\\\"  But I didn't know his home number. I say, \\\"Karina, what's his number?\\\" She  says, \\\"I can't remember.\\\" I say, \\\"Who knows his number? Who can I call?\\\" She  says, \\\"I don't know anything, leave me alone.\\\"  I went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was  crying, too. I say, \\\"Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can  we call him? Who knows his telephone number?\\\" I tell Marina, \\\"Think, think,  who can we call to find out?\\\" She started calling; several people didn't  answer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and  found out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he  was at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can't talk normally. She says,  \\\"Lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and  tell them that they just can't do that.\\\" She still didn't know what was really going on. I said, \\\"It's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's  happening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single  Armenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised  that we managed to save ourselves. \\\"She says, \\\"Well, OK, if it's that serious  . . . \\\" And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up  and that I'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. \\\"OK,  fine, fine,\\\" she says, \\\"if you're afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back  I'll send him over.\\\"  We called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly  under Aunt Tanya's, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian's apartment. She  wasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed  everything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on trying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and  finally we get through. She says, \\\"Yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your  place now.\\\" He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening, either,  because he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep  with his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what  shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has  grown up daughters, they're almost my age.  The three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and went down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No,  first they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As soon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said that we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might have fractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the first floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around eleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I  saw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies . . . everything just like a war.  They carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical people from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older  Armenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud  she would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle  Arkady, I think, because someone said \\\"Arkady, get an injection ready,\\\" he  started to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But  when he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his  sixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and  started to cry: \\\"What have they done to you?!\\\" He was speaking Armenian. \\\"What have they done to you?!\\\" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and  she started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. \\\"I'll give you a shot.\\\"  Mamma tells him, \\\"I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what  are they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people, and you're just sitting here!\\\" Some teacups were standing on the table in  there. \\\"You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my  daughters! Look what they've turned them into!\\\" They gave her something to  drink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the doctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa  and Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina  out. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I  don't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: \\\"What's  the matter with you?\\\" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter in the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's. I said, \\\"I'm fine.\\\" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told  the doctor, \\\"You leave, let a woman examine her.\\\" A woman came, an  Azerbaijani, I believe, and said, \\\"What's wrong with you?\\\" I was wearing my  sister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When  she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would  be easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed her. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge  wound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said  something to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be  dressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital.  They put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me.  I raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't  know if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, \\\"Lie still, you mustn't move.\\\" When I was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed  very familiar to me. I shouted, \\\"Stop!\\\" One of the policemen turned and says,  \\\"What do you want?\\\" I say, \\\"Bring him to me, I want to look at him.\\\" They  brought him over and I said, \\\"That person was just in our apartment and he  just raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.\\\" They said,  \\\"Fine,\\\" but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were  taking him.  Then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were  sitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car  up closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, \\\"Sister . . . \\\" I don't  remember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they did to us. I asked him, \\\"Where are you from?\\\" He said that he was from Ufa.  Apparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I  learned that they suffered most of all. He says, \\\"OK, you're Armenians, they  didn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian,\\\" he says, \\\"what are they trying  to kill me for?\\\" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the  balcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw  two Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed  against the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him with his own club. The way he cried \\\"Mamma\\\" made my skin crawl. I don't know  what they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before  he attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the third or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was  Azerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they were throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with  someone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the  yard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that I realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.  They took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too  and said, \\\"I've been beaten too, help me.\\\" But they just ignored her. My  father went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault  that he'd been beaten, and says, \\\"My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have  probably broken my ribs. Please look at them.\\\" The doctor says, \\\"That's not my job.\\\" Urshan said, \\\"Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor,  I'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them  to his apartment.  Marina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the  doctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I  wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very surprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the Hippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy-- coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she, having examined Karina, said, \\\"No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like  they did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women. \\\"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she would certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same  story. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no  drugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soon found out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And they started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at  zoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from  seeing it.  They put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have  any serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their  place, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira  her daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And Ira was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed. When they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she  involuntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again. Her daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful  when I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, \\\"Do what you want with me, just leave my daughter alone.\\\" Well, they did what they  wanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I  would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It  was simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do  every day: steal, kill, rape . . .  Many are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts  explained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those  children would be grown, and then, as they put it, \\\"we'll come take the  pleasure out of their lives, those children.\\\" This was about the girls that would be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow  because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just as there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be  of some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the  victims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, that they would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they themselves said that.  And this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many  people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know  why their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before,  maybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and  they weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at  nothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with  Marina: \\\"Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over  there [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman  shouldn't see such things.\\\" So they were really quite sober . . .  So we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all  happened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several  hours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what happened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk- ing to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when he thought no one is listening: \\\"Listen,\\\" he'll say, \\\"what could I do? What could I do alone, how could I protect them?\\\" I don't know where to find the words, it's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen.  That's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of  course he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail of what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke together in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never present at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And when the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present.  On February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital. First they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city,  the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier.  There were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family  there. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They  were sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife  and Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying.  Then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard. There's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area. They took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide. The women were shouting. They explained to them: \\\"We want to hide you better because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.\\\"  We went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We had children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to  have their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful.  They kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you  could see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the  police precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is  surrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were  standing on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought  great psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't  just walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48, or those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost  family members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened  when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a single person, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must have already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret  room down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at one another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those  people, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that the end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the  hospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my  parents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should  attack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an  Armenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and  she wouldn't be able to take it.  Then soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people  climbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers. They all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We  calmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some  little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children to the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never  have occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people  do eat.  Then, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They  were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from  the courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a  different woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing,  and calling out: \\\"Oh, Rafik!,\\\" but when she heard about this such a rage came  over her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her  sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were  soldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash  him! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not  one of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from  doing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands,  muttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile appeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round was over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing  terribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the  creeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did  this the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She  went five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women,  \\\"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they  raped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though  nothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?\\\" She appealed to everyone, but no  one got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I  could barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so  many hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already after ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the  elderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time.  There was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking.  The situation was deplorable.  At eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen,  Azerbaijanis. They said, \\\"Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash up and put the children to bed.\\\" Now the women didn't want to leave this place,  either. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with  dogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, \\\"Oh, it's our little  family,\\\" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for  the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone spoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded machine guns in their hands, said, \\\"Grandmother, you mustn't approach me, I'm on guard.\\\" Our people would say, \\\"Oh, that's all right.\\\" They hugged them, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly moving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.  They took us up to the second floor and said, \\\"You can undress and sleep in  here. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city.\\\" This was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other places. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the SK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I  asked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me. I didn't know what was happening there. They told me, \\\"Don't worry, the Maternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest assured. I say, \\\"Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in there is capable of anything.\\\"  When I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had already been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi- tal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once we were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met  acquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who  hadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with  them, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had  come their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like  they had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people,  hungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of  course the stories and the talk were flying: \\\"Oh, I heard that they killed  him!\\\" \\\"What do you mean they killed him!\\\" \\\"He stayed at work!\\\" \\\"Do you know  what's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.  And then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very  well and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small  room, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night  talking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary  of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see  Bagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed  from outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask  him things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by  soldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with  the people. Apparently he had more important things to do.  Several hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, \\\"Lyudochka, find another  two or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs,  lists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people  who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.\\\" I  had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, \\\"Lyuda, your  Mamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are  alive and well and that you're here.\\\" I gave the lists to someone and asked  them to continue what I was doing and went off.  The list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian's father, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels Grigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the  name of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said  that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front of the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later  it turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had somehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for  Krasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that  in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored  missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3  All the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were  contained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple  of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, \\\"What's  going on?\\\" He said, \\\"Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels they are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev [Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to him, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it was one or fifty.\\\" They told him that the list had disappeared and they should ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over again. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26 was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because that's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26  people on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only  a half of those that were on the first list. He said, \\\"Lyuda, please, try to remember at least one more.\\\" But I couldn't remember anyone else. But there were more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy don't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people  whose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims of the Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many  people left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns in Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the  Krasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that  there are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical  Krestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk  cows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went  to help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering the city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the  Azerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there's more. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list  drawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course don't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to  publicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court,  they simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of them is the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No.  8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know  her name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in  Microdistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the  same landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding  the door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and  when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her  braid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because  they didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one  . . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore.  They transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived for days in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there  and I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina;  it was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could  already walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the  social work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said,  \\\"If it weren't for the work I would go insane.\\\" He and I put ourselves in gear and took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers  and free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything,  although we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been  dispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it  was free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by to see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly visible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.  On March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir Fedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered  only Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital. Mother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.  Shirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I  told him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and record everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind.  We didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the conditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor  quality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there  weren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a  curfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or  video cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that  we can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially  to draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw that the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to  Sumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with  Bibishev, I told him myself, \\\"Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two  months, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in those two days, I'll help you conduct the investigation.\\\"  He and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I gave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to her, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her- self. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x- rays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eat and drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we were in Baku already, the investigator told me, \\\"How long can you go on like  this? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're not taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this investigation through. We need you.\\\" Then I started eating, because in fact I was exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart- ment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement cells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in every prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of Sumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary  confinement.  Thus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma  identified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn't identify  anyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren't among the  photographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one  who went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the  loose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know  his first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his  sisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that  even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will  continue looking for him.  The 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various  plants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect. Mostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only one of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and Chemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga- tor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front of me \\\"I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash simply for keeping him out of Armenia,\\\" that is, to keep him from landing in a prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if the investigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even though we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological pressure--they say, \\\"Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in an Armenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of you in short order.\\\" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.  The investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire pogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then that I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was  in our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and  all the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned  them, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials from the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James  Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were  boiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had  been in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's  enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't even know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did  take worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out  slippers.  Of those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait.  Basically, the group that went seeking \\\"revenge\\\"--let's use their word for  it--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with  one of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that  black I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking part in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of  Tamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently arrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I  don't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an  Azerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know  nothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an  axe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and  threw them into the tub with water.  I remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You  know, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both  their hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey- eyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I  identified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born in the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How  did I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I  kept thinking, is that Rita or \\\"puma,\\\" which it would be if you read the word  as Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic \\\"T\\\" was the one  that looks like a Latin \\\"M.\\\" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind his back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to put in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and  told me that I was making a mistake, and called me \\\"dear sister.\\\" He said,  \\\"You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an  Armenian,\\\" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator  asked me, \\\"Lyuda, are you sure it was he?\\\" I told him, \\\"I'll tell you one more identifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The  name Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.\\\" He went rigid and became  pale. They told him, \\\"Put your hands on the table.\\\" He put his hands on the table with the palms up. I said, \\\"Now turn your hands over,\\\" but he didn't  turn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they  forced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently. But he insolently stuck to his story, \\\"No, I did not do anything, it wasn't  me.\\\" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his hand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew into a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out  of granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it.  Catching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked and the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and  back. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how,  but I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or  strangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the  microphone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his last name, and he says, \\\"Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . . \\\" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped.  They took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down,  because we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, \\\"You're  some actress! What a performance!\\\" I said, \\\"Tolya, honestly . . . \\\" Beforehand they would always tell me, \\\"Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if  nothing had happened to you.\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have any more strength or  emotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength  . . . I don't have the strength to do anything.\\\" And he says, \\\"Lyuda, how were you able to do that?\\\" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching the tape, I said, \\\"Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped  that high in gym class.\\\"  So you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of  the 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who  beat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.  At the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his  guilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among them were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said,  \\\"Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three o'clock.\\\" He said, \\\"No, I'm not coming.\\\" They told him, \\\"If you don't come  we'll kill you.\\\" He said, \\\"Alright, I'll come.\\\" And he went.  They also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He had also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a  motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him  out of his apartment and told him the same thing: \\\"Tomorrow we're going to get the Armenians. Be there.\\\" He said, \\\"No.\\\" They pulled a knife on him. He said,  \\\"I'm not going all the same.\\\" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed  him several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was in the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that  we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.  I'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he beat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he was very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for him, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning of Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our  apartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our  apartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I  don't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blacked out very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina because he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the courtyard, he remained in the apartment.  At one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her I learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't  have a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his third and, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work with bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.  The others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can't call them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying out someone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, \\\"I don't  understand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.\\\" But we know that they were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In the name of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam-- that's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do. Because I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about their level of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they work, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they  crowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were  promised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments. So off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, \\\"they  promised us apartments.\\\"  Among them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the heart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a  children's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at  the children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they  have they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or  grandparents. And he said, \\\"I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . how I ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my  own, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.\\\" And the whole time I kept repeating, \\\"Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife  right before your own eyes.\\\" He sat there and just wailed.  But that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a  marvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just  have to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his grandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how  to cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he  knew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed  himself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained.  That one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr  Gambarian was murdered. He came in and said, \\\"Let's go, enough, you've spilled enough blood here.\\\"  Maybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was  that they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya and her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They  liked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When  Karina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors  old me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to  the entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were  already at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came back and started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have  sustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older  woman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of  Karina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off. The woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands  and led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth,  he sees everything, and He won't forgive this.  There was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first  floor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a custom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them. But they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is  tantamount to trampling a woman's honor.  Now that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we  have gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these  events that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come  about? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that  without a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not  have happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis, let other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their  nations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are  a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for what they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they  threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done, to snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on February 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone  who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left for their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got as far away as their legs would carry them.  February 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came  into my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had  been a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for  a meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few  teachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or  seven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there  were a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the  evening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and  the crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the  microphone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the  driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani child off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had seen it himself..The crowd started to rage: \\\"Death to the Armenians! They must be killed!\\\" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because  people were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The  woman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians  cut her daughters' breasts off, and called, \\\"Sons, avenge my daughters!\\\" That  was enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the  direction of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.  We stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a  very nationalist speech. He said, \\\"Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!\\\" This  he repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him  stormily, whistling and shouting \\\"Karabagh!\\\" He said, \\\"Karabagh has been our  territory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my  heart?\\\" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. \\\"It's our  territory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated.  From time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from time immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years  the Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.\\\" By filth he meant  Armenians.  I heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely. Many people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with  the other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate, that in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our teachers said, \\\"Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's  spouting,\\\" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we  listened to the woman's speech.  Right then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the  subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of studies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I had considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to  obtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me, \\\"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If  they find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I  tell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?\\\" When he  said it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a  second time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already after eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered,  \\\"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until  twelve. Stay here.\\\" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in  kindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: \\\"I left my  children at the kindergarten.\\\" The director excused her. When she let her go I turned around, said, \\\"Good-bye,\\\" and left with the young teacher, the  Azerbaijani. I didn't see them after that.  When we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran nearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too  much for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed  off. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher  wouldn't say that I was an Armenian.  To make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at  the movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and again my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched  television as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last  day. That's how it all was.  At the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together, Zhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store  on Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she  doesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father  held the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the  ground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went  out on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the  entryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders  there. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the  moment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been  injured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor,  and their children: any way they could.   Where it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin,  Armen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims  what was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one  another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even  with muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and  their old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got  them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked  electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then  they took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an  Azerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director and told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to  escape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of  course, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only thing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The  Armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored  personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and led everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored  personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that  very moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves.  I heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big,  strong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a  strong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.  One of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking  for the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected,  people hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps  dead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went  with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found  Azerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and  put down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or  infection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the  neighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject  came up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the  basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor carried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing  as one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor  took his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything  seemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing  of ours he had managed to \\\"save.\\\"  Raya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended  themselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were Azerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some  reason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just  victims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too.  In the TV show \\\"Pozitsiya\\\" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that  the Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not  important, the truth will come out regardless.  So that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our  bravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the  years and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've  become, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.  On that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said that it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments received by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans  will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the  Procuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga- tion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on  the street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fear speaking our native tongue.

I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.  The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate.  The difference is not in \\\"contraceptive technology\\\" but in the values taught to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids.  Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired.    Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't we teach \\\"safe drug use\\\" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it because we know that a class in \\\"how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs\\\" would increase drug use?  Why isn't \\\"drug abstinence education\\\" barred from schools because it teaches \\\"religion\\\"?  Aren't we abandoning those children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe use?  \",\" > > :has 2^80 possible keys.  > >  > > We don't yet know if all 80 bits count.  >  > That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something  >they can get caught at.

Ask yourself this.  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least partially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly evaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released) The answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't.  There is other hardware out there not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.)  My suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper systems.  If not we're in trouble.  Given that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like to think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this. They know their initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never taken seriously.  The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You know little about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step in the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banning or SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the \\\"Clipper\\\" system is easily justified \\\"Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying to subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternative so use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever.\\\" How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system the only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can't, and the administration knows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for drug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.  Don't sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid. Either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations collective I.Q. is about that of a potato.  Why do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big, and NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it, noone will buy the stuff that doesn't have to.  AT&T must know this too, THINK MAN, why the hell would they jump the gun?   I really wonder.  To wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton:  The White House Office of the Press Secretary c/o: Presidential Comment Line (fax) (202) 456-2461   April 17, 1993   Sir and/or Madam:     I must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and cryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.   It is apparent to me that those who drafted the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \\\"Big Brother Proposal\\\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep      ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \\\"experts\\\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.   In addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \\\"tamper proof\\\" the key escrows might be.   I cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti      lize the \\\"Big Brother Chip.\\\"   Unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like \\\"harmony,\\\" \\\"right to encryption,\\\" and \\\"voluntary.\\\"   It mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is \\\"I can't believe it's happening here.\\\"  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; \\\"When is the Reichstag fire planned for?\\\"           Most Concerned,         [Signature]       Shaen Logan Bernhardt I uni@acs.bu.edu \",\" I know this is a little weird, but I know that World magazine (you know, National Geo. for children) did a very simple and concise article on Kirlian photography.

Is an interpretation of the words of Paul of higher priority than the direct word of Jesus in Matt5:14-19? Paul begins Romans 14 with \\\"If someone is weak in the faith ...\\\" Do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith?   Yes, but what does the Bible have to say? What did Jesus say? Paul closes Romans 14 with, \\\"On the other hand, the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty, because he isn't acting on his faith, and any failure to act on faith is a sin.\\\" Gaus, ISBN:0-933999-99-2 Have you read the Ten Commandments which are a portion of the Law? Have you read Jesus' word in Matt5:14-19? Is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is sin (Greek hamartia = missing the mark)?   Whereas, the Ten Commandments and Jesus' words in Matt5:14-19 are fairly clear, are they not?   Matt5:14-19 doesn't answer your question?   Breaking bread - roughly synonymous with eating.   How do you unite this concept of yours with the Ten Commandments and Jesus's word in Matt5:14-19?   Or, they assumed that the Ten Commandments and Jesus' word in Matt5:14-19 actually stood for something? Perhaps they were \\\"strong in the faith?\\\"  ---------------------------  [No, I don't believe that Paul can overrule God.  However Paul was writing for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5. As far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did continue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they continued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with Gentile Christians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it).  Jesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that Mat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact with Gentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a couple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke 7) suggest that he was a \\\"God-fearer\\\", i.e. a Gentile who followed God, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended by Jewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such. This seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view that Gentiles need not accept the Law.  However there's more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on the Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ. Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law. It still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.  While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law.  The \\\"not an iota or dot\\\" would suggest a rather literal reading, but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the \\\"ceremonial law\\\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards.  The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish ceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much trouble.  It's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the way terms like \\\"family values\\\" take on special meaning from the current context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why \\\"family values\\\" should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I think Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was involved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values that go along with the term \\\"Law\\\", any more than people who concerned about the \\\"family values\\\" movement are really opposed to family values.\",\"     These people were very silly.

Science does not make any claims about the existence or non-existence of objects which do not affect the physical world.   The purpose of science is to produce a model of the *physical* world.  The model must be able to explain all past observations and predict the outcome of future observations.  One of the aims of experiments is to carry out well defined observations which are objective.  Ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world, and the model which realises on the minimal number of assumptions.  At the moment models which do not rely on the assumption of some *spiritual* world existing are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a *spiritual* world.  As the non-spiritual models has fewer assumptions it should be the currently accepted models.  The scientific process never assumes that its present models are the correct ones, whereas many religions claim to represent the truth.  The arrogance of many theists is that they claim to represent the truth, this cannot be said of scientists.\",\" ------------ Part 6 of 14 ------------ MAZ)75U=7R!1KP\\\"5A8=F>`7;UG)\\\\&V0&>*YZ>*W5&$'Z]M;T0AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX=7HLAL(;7(5U\\\\,MEIH@$H^,#\\\",4*&?8%'U#6#,-V`W!H>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'A[0E9:0E97PM8]8M9#MH M6CNL]%&'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AUL4SU=7Z/*V&U<2X!!:6M3BYK7L:.Q-TZ#Q M[/%#\\\\>SL[.R'AX>'A\\\\!$%$-:U`Q7S]1_S\\\\BB%!2B5Q2'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'A\\\\\\\"@ M`B'Q(DCQ[$H=L;FGO;5:X(>'AX>J\\\"<]75\\\\B`P;Z@,-\\\"X@^&?S%$<JPV?-P;K MH9\\\\WS!=@-XQ<AX>'AS'$9@L+I4=Z>BJ[P#9U)5L4`LA75P);V6$KGJEXE5-3 M[>V+BXN+BXN+BXN+BXLT-,7%-#0T-#0T-#0T-#0TBXN+[>WM4[\\\"PSU?/@$H, M5\\\\]-(8AH:(#!0]QH:&S30QVQ:$,0L;&([/%'1T='W]_?W]_?W]^I=3:F:JQ2 M`2NTOJYN#N`0:.SP99LI])0GGV!1%X&,]\\\"0M<(>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AS'$9F8+I:5'1Z6E M\\\"V;$,3$QQ,3$9F8+\\\"PNEI0L+9L0Q,3$Q,3$Q,3'$Q&9F9@L+\\\"PL+\\\"PMF\\\"PL+ M\\\"PL+9L3$Q#$QAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>' MAX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX=4 M5%22DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2 MDI*2DI*2DI*2DI*2DI*25%145%145%145%145%14%A86%A86%LG)R<G)R<G) MR<G)R<G)R<G)R<G)R<G)R<G)R<F)B8F)B8F)B8F)B8F)B8G)R<G)R<G)B8F) MB8F)B8F)B8F)3$Q,3$P/9\\\\4T-(OM[>U3L!D9<3T]F0,#7KN[*BHJ*GIZ>M_?

Is it distressing Brendan?  The point is that any eugenic solution to the Jewish Problem as Elias has proposed smacks of pure Nazism.  The fact that Elias' proposal cast the entire \\\"problem\\\" as one of the abnormal presence of Israeli society in the Middle East, and that he buried a slam against U.S. aid to Israel in the midst of his \\\"even-handed\\\" solution of the Jewish Question, made it obvious what  he had in mind: disolving the Jewish polity.  That *is* a Nazi doctrine: rectification of the \\\"abnormal presence\\\" of the Jewish people within a  larger body politic.  Whether your \\\"solution\\\" involves gas, monetary  incentives to the poor Jews to marry out, or as Feisal Husseini has  said, \\\"disolve the Zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal  surrounding Arab culture,\\\" you are engaged in a Nazi project.  Just as obvious is your statement: \\\"I will not comment on the value or lack of value of Elias's proposal.\\\"  Still striking the glancing blow, right Brendan?

Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically     reduces a woman's chances of getting vaginal candida, a yeast infection.   For the year-long study, researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical     Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recruited 13 women who suffered from  chronic yeast infections. For the first 6 months, the women each day ate 8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second  6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the     women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection  were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.      The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.   It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The    researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some     brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus          thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used   in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a          protective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to   try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists      acidophilus in its contents.                                             --- end ---                                                ===================================  InfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92   THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED   ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS   MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

In some circumstances, though, the     organisms proliferate, producing symptomatic infection of the mouth,     intestines, vagina, or skin. When the mouth or vagina are infected, the  disease is commonly called thrush.                                         Vaginitis caused by Candida often afflicts women on birth control      pills or antibiotics. There is itching and a white, cheesy discharge.    Among narcotic addicts, Candida infections can lead to heart valve       inflammation.                                                              Diagnosis of Candida infections is confirmed by cultures and blood     tests. Treatment can be with amphotericin B or orally with ketoconazole. There is no evidence that Candida in the intestine of normal individuals leads to disease. All people at one time or another have Candida in      their intestines. Claims for any benefit from special diets or chronic   antifungal agents is not based on any solid evidence.                    --- end ---    ========================== I hope this is informative.

It is clear that Mr. Wingate intends to continue to post tangential or unrelated articles while ingoring the Challenges themselves.  Between the last two re-postings of the Challenges, I noted perhaps a dozen or more posts by Mr. Wingate, none of which answered a single Challenge.    It seems unmistakable to me that Mr. Wingate hopes that the questions will just go away, and he is doing his level best to change the subject.  Given that this seems a rather common net.theist tactic, I would like to suggest that we impress upon him our desire for answers, in the following manner:  1. Ignore any future articles by Mr. Wingate that do not address the Challenges, until he answers them or explictly announces that he refuses to do so.  --or--  2. If you must respond to one of his articles, include within it something similar to the following:      \\\"Please answer the questions posed to you in the Charley Challenges.\\\"  Really, I'm not looking to humiliate anyone here, I just want some honest answers.  You wouldn't think that honesty would be too much to ask from a devout Christian, would you?    Nevermind, that was a rhetorical question.\",\" If you recall, a subject was raised some weeks ago that touched upon this.  When someone claimed that guerillas were manifestations of popular sentiment, the topic arose:\\\"When does a civilian stop becoming a civilian?\\\".  If he houses and shelters guerillas of his own free will, aiding them, has he violated his \\\"civilian\\\" status?   But don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways? If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  Afterall, Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas it occupied in Lebanon during SLG.   That is not exactly true.  The Hizbollah and their affiliated groups have made several attempts to infiltrate the border of Israel.   True, but the Syrians did allow (until at least 1984) guerillas to operate in the areas that were under their control, provided that those guerillas were attacking Israeli lines.  The problem is that Syria is also not as stable a partner for long term peace as others in the area might be. \",\"      The gl2p1.lzh stuff under gfx/show on the Aminet sites includes a     utility called pic2hl, that is a filter for HamLab that can handle     the most commonly used kinds of .PIC and .CLP files.      The biggest problem is that the .CLP files don't usually contain a     palette, so you need to convert a .PIC with the right palette     first (which creates a \\\"ram:picpal\\\" file), and then convert the     .CLP files. \",\" I think in Illinois venereal disease (the old ones, not AIDS) was included.

Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies seize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.  WE have to take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create laws and rules only to better their positions within the government.  WE have allowed them to take too much power from the people of this nation.  That situation has to be changed.  Allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off drug informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact with the Devil himself.  It's a vicious cycle.  The law enforcement agencies are motivated to seize property to fund their own activities.  And having no easy way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more incentive for the agencies to take property.  It's also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that Clinton would have the \\\"plumbers\\\" out in force shortly.  Clinton and his henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control.  Anytime a leader believes in that, the leader will use every means possible to retain that control and take more.

Although Gary is correct in noting that malpractice-related problems are greater in the US than Canada, they by no means account for the overall difference in health care costs.  (They do account for a somewhat larger portion of the difference in physicians' gross income in the two countries.)  Some facts.  Malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1% of total health care costs in the US.  In 1991, according to a survey of  physicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averaged paying 3.7% of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance.   Malpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985; they've declined significantly since then.  At the same time, health care costs have increased more than any period in history.  As far as \\\"defensive medicine\\\" is concerned, the AMA estimates that its total impact is about $7 billion per year.  That's about 8% of the total current INCREASE in health care costs -- and the estimate is from a group that could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicine on health care.  As small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things, however, Clinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnification of MD's against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by their specialties.  This would eliminate most, if not all frivolous suits while retaining the ability to sue for true malpractice.  jsh\",\" Ever heard of something called the placebo effect?

Deputy Prime Minister Erdal Inonu told reporters in Ankara that Turkey was responding positively to a request from Azerbaijan for assistance.  \\\"We are giving a positive response to all requests\\\" from Azerbaijan, \\\"within the limits of our capabilities,\\\" he said.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Vural Valkan declined to elaborate on the nature of the aid being sent to Azerbaijan, but said they were within the framework  of the Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  Hurriyet, published in Istanbul, said Turkey was sending light weapons to Azerbaijan, including rockets, rocket launchers and ammunition.  Ankara began sending the hardware after a visit to Turkey last week by a high-ranking Azerbaijani official. Turkey has however ruled out, for the second time in one week, that it would intervene militarily in Azerbaijan.  Wednesday, Inonu told reporters Ankara would not allow Azerbaijan to suffer defeat at the hands of the Armenians. \\\"We feel ourselves bound to help Azerbaijan, but I am not in a position right now to tell you what form (that) help may take in the future,\\\" he said.  He said Turkish aid to Azerbaijan was continuing, \\\"and the whole world knows about it.\\\"  Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel reiterated that Turkey would not get militarily involved in the conflict. Foreign policy decisions could not be  based on street-level excitement, he said.  There was no immediate reaction in Ankara to regional reports, based on Armenian sources in Yerevan, saying Turkish pilots and other officers were captured when they were shot down flying Azerbaijani warplanes and  helicopters.  The newspaper Cumhuriyet said Turkish troops were digging in along the border with Armenia, but military sources denied reports based on claims by local people that gunfire was heard along the border. No military action has  occurred, the sources said.  The latest upsurge in fighting between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis flared early this month when Armenian forces seized the town of Kelbajar and later positioned themselves outside Fizuli, near the Iranian border.  \",\" Canada's GST is collected as a sales tax and is considered a VAT.

The arrangements will not have a      territorial application, nor will they apply to the Israeli population      of the territories or to the Palestinian inhabitants of Jerusalem;    >Residual powers not delegated under the ISGA will be reserved by Israel;    >Israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd;    >Israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects-     external, internal- and for the maintenance of public order;    >The organs of the ISGA will be of an administrative-functional nature;    >The exercise of powers under the ISGA will be subject to cooperation and      coordination with Israel.     >Israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the      areas of administration, justice, personnel, agriculture, education,     business, tourism, labor and social welfare, local police,     local transportation and communications, municipal affairs and religious     affairs.  Several question do come to mind concerning the \\\"success\\\" we all hope for  in the ongoing negotiation process. These arrangements certainly seem to  be essentially a rejection of any Palestinian \\\"interim\\\" self-control.  Without exposing itself to unwarranted risks and creating irresversible  vulnerability, can Israel reasonably put forward (at later points in the  negotiating process) more \\\"relaxed\\\" proposals for this\\\"interim\\\" period?  How should proposals (from either side) be altered to temper their  \\\"maximalist\\\" approaches as stated above? How can Israeli worries ,and  desire for some \\\"interim control\\\", be addressed while providing for a   very *real* interim Palestinian self-governing entity?

Over the last few years I have heard of one case after another of government running completely amok.  Unfortunately, most people are oblivious of the government's crimes and still think of it as their protector.  So I intend to put together what I call the \\\"American Horror File\\\": a compilation of cases where the American government has run roughshod over the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusing especially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants, and financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws, but including any other cases for which I can find decent documentation.  I hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting, red-hot enraged at their government.  The end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ASCII text and postscript files) detailing the government's crimes of recent years.  This book will be distributed at cost, and I will encourage people to post copies to BBS's, send copies on disk to friends, and print out copies and give them to neighbors.

Perhaps you should examine in yourself why as such a good friend, you  are unwilling to accept this imortant part of your friends life?  Why  do you call into question his faith?  Your friend has changed, he has  found something that fills a need in his life.  You need to decide if  you are still his friend, whether you can accommodate his new life.   It sounds as if you are criticizing him for a fundamental belief in  the Bible, yet you are quick to reveal that your fundamental belief  that it is superstition.  Perhaps if he knew you at least took him  seriously, that you at least took an interest in the light he has found,  that you at least tried to understand what has become a special part of  his life, you could together decide to become fundamentalists, respect  each others differences and remain friends, or part ways.  Maybe even if  you stuck it out with him, you could help him to un-convert.  Of course,  if you go in with that attitude he will surely see through your intentions  and begin to resent you.  I happen to be a person very tolerant of fundamentalists, because I know that the idea of a simple black and white approach to life is appealing. I don't happen to share the beliefs of fundamentalists, but I am not offended by their prosyletizing.  I had a few good conversations with some Witnesses who came to my door.  I didn't switch my beliefs, but for those at home who maybe need a friendly face to invite them somewhere, the Witnesses provide a wonderful service.

Are you afraid you might be converted and become one of them, that you will be swept up in fundamentalism, that you will become a weirdo. Friendship's a two-way street.

Actually, I guess he wasn't amazingly cool about it--His response is what you'd hope for (indeed, expect) from a human being.  I s'pose I just _didn't_ expect it...    I find it absurd that religion exists; Yet, I can also see its usefulness to people.  Facing up to the fact that you're just going to be worm food in a few decades, and that there isn't some cosmic purpose to humanity and the universe, can be pretty difficult for some people.  Having a readily-available, pre-digested solution to this is pretty attractive, if you're either a) gullible enough, b) willing to suspend your reasoning abilities for the piece of mind, or c) have had the stuff rammed down your throat for as long as you can remember.

I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created a colormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the lines in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using XPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay around when the window is refreshed.  Currently, to draw interactively, I begin with:     /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */    /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */    palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;    palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;    palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;    XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);    XFlush( myDisplay);     XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);    XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex);  Then to draw I do:     XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);    XFlush( myDisplay);  And when I'm all done, to return things to normal I do:     XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy);   What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of whatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are over a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.  But the GXxor function seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box, it erases and redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).  Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong?\",\" No, but some OS's ( COHERENT , etc ) are able to drive one of the ports in polled mode without using the IRQ. In your example, after accessing the modem, the mouse won't work until you reboot, because the IRQ is used by the modem.   Yes, you can change the IRQ's for com3/4, but it depends on your other hardware. com1 uses IRQ4, com2 IRQ3.  If you have only one printerport  ( IRQ7 ), you can change com3 to IRQ5 ( normally 2nd printer ). For com4, you can assign IRQ2, if its free.

These aren't, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. That term denotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. The rockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, to distinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-made ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines with graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A \\\"D\\\" engine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse. An \\\"F\\\" engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to a doubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size \\\"O\\\" are available pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above are shipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines of size F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not as controlled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocket engines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.)  There is an HPR Society, The Tripoli Rocket Society, I believe, which holds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities (FAA waiver included) taken care of. The National Association of Rocketry is more concerned with engines below H, though it is involved in HPR as well. These societies certify users of HPR rockets, and companies will not sell to uncertified individuals.  Bottom Line: It's legit.

I hear that they're called : 'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool? : I hope someone can help  :----------------------- During the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough to melt. When this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling tower where it is sprayed into the air. Contact with the cool outside air will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor. There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day.  Cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be. Power companies are forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires the raw uranium emisions to be held to under 1%. This law is now under attack by lawyers arguing that the 1% should be measured at the edge of the property rather than the edge of the cooling tower. Eliminating this law will save power companies thousands of dollars in concrete costs for new nukes.\",\"The Hawks won the Norris div, and sealed their fate.  It's bad luck to win the Norris.

I think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court. Currently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones, record calls without listening to them, and then post-facto obtain warrants and listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But this strategy wouldn't get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not in the near term.)  In other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence inadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to interpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I'd be surprised that archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything but analogous to a wiretap by the courts.  Note that that doesn't mean I think it won't be done if technically feasible.  Just as I'm sure many wiretaps are done now without warrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future, start surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause, decrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation gets a boost from data that, sadly, won't ever be presented to a jury.  While I'm posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this archiving scenario to extremes, read \\\"Lacey and his Friends\\\", a collection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the slippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don't worry folks, it's stored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can get to it.  And by the way, we'll be installing cameras on all major streets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and teller machines, don't we?  And then we'll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public places.  Then in some private places.  Then we'll make it a crime ever to be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy cubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and after.  But, see, there's still a right to privacy.  We haven't curtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it'd be to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a VR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.  And hey, nobody'll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.  After all, if you're not doing anything illegal...  Funny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became pretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn't elminate all crime in the story.

I like Larry, but I'm not sure I feel strongly enough about the computer to buy a service manual for it.  On a related note:  what does the monitor connector connect to?\",\"  There are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the fans.  I feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties more than names honouring personages.  And of course, they would not appear nearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time.   Another thing that bothers me is the points system.  Percentages, as used in the other major sports are clearly more informative.  When I look at the NHL standings the first thing I have to do is make a quick calculation to account for games in hand (which is almost always the case).  Some will object to percentages, claiming perhaps, that it is an \\\"Americanization\\\" of the sport but I feel that using percentages is more informative and whether it is \\\"American\\\" or not is irrelevant.    Even if Orr couldn't have contributed without the likes of Norris, you would have to agree that Norris couldn't have contributed without the likes of Orr. And taking a poll of most fans would quickly tell you who the fans feel made the more meaningful contribution.    It doesn't look as if the division names are going to hold up either does it?   -- \",\" Ford tried that also, back in 1983.  My 1983 Ranger Pickup had the horn at the end of the turn-signal stalk, instead of in the center of the wheel where God intended it to be. :-)  I drove two different cars then (the other an 1984 Camry), and never did get used to pushing the turn-signal stalk to blow the horn.  The only time I got it right was when I was getting the annual state-required safety inspection! Not one of Ford's better ideas. \",\"Jesus isn't God ? When Jesus returns some people may miss Him ?

These   are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the   performance of your workstation.    Well, more hardware isn't always an option, and I wonder if more   hardware is always even a necessity.    This \\\"FAQ\\\" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different   people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X   Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.    Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must   balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal   decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many   subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.    This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course   many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.   However, they are outside the scope of this document.      [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system     performance, might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook     \\\"System Performance Tuning\\\" by Mike Loukides.  I'm about 25% of the     way through reading it, and it looks like a well-written     comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm unaware of any     other similar books.  --ed.]  ----------------- Table of Contents -----------------   0. Introduction & Administrivia   1. What about the \\\"Other X FAQ\\\"?   2.

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few   months old (see the \\\"Last-modified\\\" date above) you should probably   locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.    If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does   not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can   retrieve this FAQ from an archive site.    There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about   them and how to access them, please see the \\\"Introduction to the   news.answers newsgroup\\\" posting in news.answers.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and   well written \\\"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\\\" document.   Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates   on performance.    The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with   regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:  \\\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\\\".   (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).  --------------- Window Managers ---------------    There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different   features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a   balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this   point, most respondents have agreed upon \\\"twm\\\" as the best candidate   for a speedy window manager.     A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,   is turning off unnecessary things like \\\"zooming\\\" and \\\"opaque move\\\".   Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the   amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping   windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)    I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:   -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is   the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)   and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the   display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.  ------------ The X Server ------------  Which Server? - - - - - - -   Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.   If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.    On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between   the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to   me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute   to less paging.            [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),                         Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]    How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law   (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be   compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.   You can expect to get \\\"*very* large speedups in the server\\\" by not   using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results   would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial   compilers on the market.  Locking the Server into RAM? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and   does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help   performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few   pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone   who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.        [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),           Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),           Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ] Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - -   Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :     If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep     for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my     .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...     we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.    This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!      Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of   why this works, which I have summarized here:      When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to     start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by     the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of     pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the     server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you     put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself     sorted out before the clients start up.      Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X     client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources     being fetched, programs initializing state and \\\"databases\\\" and so     forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this     initialization is done (\\\"The process has reached a steady state\\\"),     the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.     By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your     .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your     workstation's limited resources    This is most definitely a \\\"Your Mileage May Vary\\\" situation, as there   are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap   space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients   you are starting, etc.    Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &    I've experimented with:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 3; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 4; exec xterm ) &    I've even tried:  (sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &   and then in start_X_clients_script I had:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &      [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had     completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down     into a \\\"steady state\\\" before the sleep expired and all my clients     were launched. ]    All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with   my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to   experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.  Fonts - - -   Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts   your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.    One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one   large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or   at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.   Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded   into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer   fonts will be loaded by the server.          [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),            Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]    eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13   in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since   I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.    Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):     Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.     If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.  About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - -      Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves     on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)    One suggestion:      In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum     number of resources that you want to have available to all of your     applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true      Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific     resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your     .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:   setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N      [ The \\\"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\\\" FAQ contains     an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.     --ed.]      So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from     .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,     and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same     XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system     app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to     find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files     with the same name.      This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).       [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),            Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),                and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).       Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]    This method of organizing your personal resources has the following   benefits:      - Easier to maintain / more usable.      - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER       property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally       quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.      - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort        through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.    It also has drawbacks:      - the application that you are interested in has to load an       additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to       make that much of a performance difference, and you might       consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an       application's resource database, you just need to re-run the       application without having to \\\"xrdb\\\" again.      - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When       your resources are split out into multiple resource files and       then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.       WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!        I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped       out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource       files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why       my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*       provide any error message when it encountered the C style       comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted       processing the resource file.        The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef       COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this       method of resource management.      - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For       example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their       resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.      - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files       with the machine where your resources are stored, your client       will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the       server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find       their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)    A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)   is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my   .Xdefaults file, and to use the \\\"separate resources files\\\" method for   clients that I seldom use.  Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In   that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to    \\\"<hostname>:0.0\\\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you   should set your DISPLAY variable to \\\"unix:0.0\\\" or \\\":0.0\\\".  By doing this   you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same   machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.    [thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]    See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further   explanation of how to properly set your display name.    \\\"I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have   libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when   the DISPLAY isn't set specially.\\\"          Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)    [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change   stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.   I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle   non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT   will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if   you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]  ------- Clients -------    If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think   carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also   about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there   a smaller clock program than xclock?    Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large   they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.    [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients   (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]    I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject   of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are   strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather   large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using   may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In   this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually   _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.    The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try   and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif   clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in   more than one toolkit library.    Know your environment, and think carefully about which client   programs would work best together in that environment.

I suspect that   xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.   Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.    If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines   to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),      Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]  1) Xvt    suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :    available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z     \\\"...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get    hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as    xterm is rather a hog! \\\"     This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to    rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current    version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that    there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any    yet.     UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with    Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He    questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For    instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling    speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap    bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm    may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard    numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text    segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.     As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it    made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets    brought into memory.     So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of    xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.    If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.

From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif   Text Field Widgets:      I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I     was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,     particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was     going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource     XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget     (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.     Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the     widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user     can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not     noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference     on a [slower system].    This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots   of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor   embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server   requests?  ------------------------- Miscellaneous Suggestions -------------------------  Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - -   Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.    - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server     is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)    - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm     conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see     people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.      I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by     having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.    - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate     that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.          [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu)     for reminding me of this one. --ed.]  A Quicker Mouse - - - - - - - -   Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen   when you move your mouse.  I use \\\"xset m 3 10\\\" in my .xinitrc file,   which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of   the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.    Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for   fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different   mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.      e.g. (for twm) :       menu \\\"mouse settings\\\" {         \\\"Mouse Settings:\\\"   f.title  \\\"  Very Fast\\\"    ! \\\"xset m 7 10 &\\\"  \\\"  Normal (Fast)\\\"   ! \\\"xset m 3 10 &\\\"  \\\"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)\\\" ! \\\"xset m default &\\\"  \\\"  Glacial\\\"    ! \\\"xset m 0 10 &\\\"       }  Programming Thoughts - - - - - - - - - - -   Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :     To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of     things you can do.  Some that stick out:      - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual       buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or       labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager       widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.      - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.      - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.       (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)      - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE       difference.      - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the       difference between a fast application and a completely unusable       one.    Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :     Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc     function would greatly increase performance of Xt based     applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying     out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some     tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the     differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)    [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]    Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :    - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.      Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but     they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the     blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most     cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to     run through it's event-loop again and again.    - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.      This \\\"Gfx Context Switching\\\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,     where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed     again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching     and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will     remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the     connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).  Say What!? - - - - - -    Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:    David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :     How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs     on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your     machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the     same operation between client and server.    I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received   the following confirmation...    Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):     I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big     difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage     and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This     helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was     essential when I only had 8 MB.    Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :     [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as     your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a     major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in     absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.    Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :     Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's     cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate     doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they     are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your     action.      The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2     cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going     over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved     buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing     even fewer context switches.  ---------------------------- Other Sources of Information ----------------------------    Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System   Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.

The air flow of small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4 uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is usually required to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a given application.  For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan. It can run and start reliably from as low as about 4.5 VDC.  It is exceptionally quiet, but at admittedly low flow.

This description   1. ignores the role of the ballast,  2. misrepresents the heating effects in the starter.  The bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts short circuit, because the neon discharge stops, and much less heat is generated from the I^2R loss in the metal as compared to the neon discharge.  The starter contacts open before the tube fires.  Actually, the tube fires as a result of the back-emf generated in the ballast because of this immediate opening of the starter's contacts.  A capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent excessive arcing during the firing.

I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.   That's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire (BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240 all have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly remembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all of them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered DESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used with a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.  My advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:  (1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add     machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going     for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which     means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.     As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it     unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).  (2) On the Mac side, you will need:     - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).     - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).     - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be       getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).     - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the       Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is       self-terminated or not.     - configure MacTCP to use \\\"Ethernet\\\".  (3) On the DECstation side, you will need:     - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.     - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.       Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the       DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable       (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).     - get a 25ohm terminator.

Madness.  /* Written  4:34 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */ /* ---------- \\\"From Israeli press. Madness.\\\" ---------- */ FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.  Paper: Zman Tel Aviv (Tel Aviv's time). Friday local Tel Aviv's paper, affiliated with Maariv.  Date: 19 February 1993  Journalist: Guy Ehrlich  Subject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan (Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate within the occupied territories.  Excerpts from the article:  \\\"A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as Arabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is that everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one way or another insane\\\".  A man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name is known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be called Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to depart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different from average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service. But in their souls, one can notice something completely different....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them. And they think that to most of their fellows from the Cherry it woundn't be easy either. Yet after they began to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking. The following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness.  (...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in which some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We called such soldiers H.I. 'Hit by the Intifada'. Under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common phenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I should talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On Fridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to until I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The keys of my father's car must be ready for in advance, so that I can go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don't want them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it instantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only there I become normal.(...)  (...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother. It was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how exactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began to laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh straight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov cocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as they deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with the effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I was delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the Arab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit him straight in his ass. We both felt that we'd pulled off something.  Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab, blood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: 'Shut up' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed straight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at something convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: 'All right, wait a moment'. I left him in order to take a look at another wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be saved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all this to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight into my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt I was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over her head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn't know what to say.  (...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a field. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend shot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the hill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it. We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two deer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully inspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We had hit'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too, so as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like beasts of prey. We couldn't explain what had happened to us. We were almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we felt the whole day very badly.  (...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in. This is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may be for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel Godlike of sorts.\\\"  (...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any security-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. 'Why shouldn't I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ? Why shouldn't I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver while being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suits me perfectly. I have no human emotions any more. If I get a reasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to Bosnia in order to fight there.\\\"\",\"  That's why we have expansion - to create more jobs. NHL teams can't afford to import role players from Europe, they pick the stars but will continue to build their teams around local players.  I'd *LOVE* to see a European NHL division but can't see it happen for some time. There's simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several \\\"crucial\\\" markets like Germany, Italy and France while Sweden and Finland probably can't afford to shell out $20-$30 for tickets the way American/Canadian fans do. Call it \\\"the Minnesota North Stars\\\" effect: Scandinavians do love hockey but we prefer to watch local, inexpensive hockey to the NHL. The National Hockey League should love the idea, though. Pan-European TV channels such as Eurosport could bring in the millions the American networks likely never will pay.\",\" day.  Personality means something to me.  That is exactly why I like Clement (and Emrick).  On the other hand, JD is a pompous, bull-headed, arrogant know-it-all.  He's a real turn-off (which is exactly what I do when he's on).  One complaint I do have about Clement is that he sometimes talks too much.  If I wanted that I'd listen to Tim McGarver doing a baseball game.\",\"I wrote :   Nice strawman indeed.  The discussion is not about whether there were tanks   used in sixties riots; instead, it is about whether those tanks fired their   main guns in one of those riots.  You claim they did.  That claim is   ludicrous.  Awesley replied:      I repeated what I had been told, under what context I had heard it,   supporting the claim that tanks were indeed used in Detroit in 67.  The issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It has been whether they fired their main guns.  You did not merely claim that tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress sniper fire and that they were \\\"quite\\\" effective at this.  You continue to back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is disputing.  Awesley went on:   I   spent a few minutes in a library today -- found their computer was   down and they don't have a card catalog.  Anyway, it took about 10   minutes to find this in _Nightmare in Detroit, A Rebellion and It's   Victims_ by Sauter and Hines, on page 133, telling of the death of   Tonia Blanding, age 4.             \\\"When the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction   the shots came from.

After a short round into the front   of the buildings, the tank guns spit again, tearing apart huge holes out   of the side of the apartment.\\\"           Well, it's not the main gun.    \\\"Well, it's not the main gun.\\\"  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you now going to admit that you were wrong?    will I see any pictures of tanks firing their main   guns?  Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells?  Will I read   the reports of the tank fire?  I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts I won't.    It will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old National Guard   sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American   cities in the Sixties.  Awesley replied:     Well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn't take long at all to   find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main   guns.  I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67 riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have been *big* news.  Awesley goes on:   You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since it makes your other claim seem more plausible.  And on:   I don't   expect to convince you; you'll have to open your mind and eyes and actually   do a little research to be convinced one way or the other.  Let me know   what you find.  I already know what you found: nothing.  If I claimed that the Marines used F-4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton, New Jersey would you believe me?  Would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research it?  Or would your bullshit filters kick in?  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about it.  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up.  If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\",\"Hi,  I just disassembled my old XT and get 2 disk drives - 30M hard drive and a  360K floppy drive.

Unline Win3.1, it does not  run on top of DOS.  It is its own OS, with (Billy Gates assures us) true  multi-tasking/multithreading, meets DOD security specs, will run win3.1  programs as well as DOS programs, has multi-processor support, and is primarily a Server program.  It's overhead is too high for it to be economical for most users.  Speaking of overhead, it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM.   It iwll run with 12, but that's like running OS/2 2.0 with 4 megs.  And that's  just to run it.  Also, I have heard that the system files take up 30-50 Megs,  and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig!  The SKD is distributed  on CD-ROM.  Chicogo is what I want to use.  It is, like NT, a true OS with thrue  multitasking and multithreading, but has much smaller hardware requirements,  and does not meet DOD security specs (but that's okay since it will probably  be more of a client OS).  there are a few otehr differences, but those are the  main ones.  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August.  The Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro$oft are in intense  competition, so it is said.  However, I think a different relationship will  arise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology), Chicogo will be the  client machine.  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together,  partly because Chicogo is just a small NT (think of it that way, anyway).   (Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS, so don't scorn the concept.)  Anyway, don't expect it soon.  Windows 4 and DOS 7 are supposed to be  released next year (read: see it in 95), so I expect that Chicogo won't be out  til '96.  With luck, I'll be proven wrong! =)  Rob\",\"        As to how many clients may be display on a server, I believe the limit would be how much memory is available to your server or allocated by the server.  \",\"   The same Bill James? Why do you say that? It sounds like you're suggesting  Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire; he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella.      Which reports are those?      I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play him IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter. Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem.       I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners. Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases.     As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak  defensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of Mel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich Jays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have.  I'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative.   \",\" There is no known writing directly attributable to Menachem Begin which admits a massacre at Deir Yassin.  Thus, Hasan is wrong.   The word \\\"troops\\\" is unjustified.  There has never been any evidence that there were any regular or irregular Arab forces in the village apart from the villagers defending themselves.  According to the Haganah observer Pa'il, the Irgun/Lehi forces suffered a lot of casualties because they were incompetent soldiers.  When they ran into trouble securing the central part of the village, a small group  of Palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty. Begin's failure to even mention the Palmach is only one of the major inaccuracies (to use a kind word) in his account.  Incidentally, \\\"three times as heavy\\\" may be correct, as there is serious evidence that the Arab loss was closer to 120 lives than to the oft-quoted 250 lives.  However, note that Begin compares wounded Jews to dead Arabs.  He fails to mention the number of wounded Arabs.  Guess why.   As is thoroughly established by many sources, the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch too far from the village for it to provide a usueful warning.   It is worth noting how Begin disputes the standard myth that the Palestinian Arabs fled as part of a calculated plan.   Apparently 90% of Israeli historians are Jew-haters.   I have previously posted quotations by Irgun participants that totally destroys Begin's whitewash.  I have no particular desire to post it yet again.\",\"  Considerably better than I feel about, say, the Punic Wars, or the  Peloponnesian War (spelling optional), or almost any other event in  classical history.

Someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to do with the use of this substance in human nutrition?   No, it's undisputed in the literature that glutamate is an amino acid which is an excitatory neurotransmitter.  There is also evidence that excessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain conditions like stroke, drowning and Lou Gehrig's disease, just to name a few. This is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid in foods.  People are not receiving intra-ventricular injections of glutamate.   I don't know about premier, but it's certainly an important one.   Sez you.  Such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any controlled studies.  Infant mice and other models are useful as far as they go, but they're not relevant to the matter at hand.  Which is not to say that I favor its use in things like baby food--a patently ridiculous use of the additive.  But we have no reason to believe that MSG in the diet effects humans adversely.   Wrong.  Do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink? Milligrams worth.  Compare that to a glass of milk.  Do you know how much glutamate is present in most protein-containing foods compared to that added by the use of MSG?

How do you avoid situations which encourage criminals?  I'd really like to know.

Especially when the university is locatd in a nice residential area.  A friend of mine was attacked and nearly raped in just this situation.  The police didn't feel she was in a situation which 'encouraged criminals'.  What do you think?  Should we just tell her, that it was her fault for daring to ride a bicycle in the middle of the day?  That she didn't avoid a situation that encouraged criminals?  If that's the case, then we'd all better put bars on our doors and windows and pray for a police state to keep us all safe.

Is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is missing the mark?   Are they clear or do you have doubts?   An important first step; the realization that Paul was human.   Yes, and he was writing and speaking for an audience that was at best, very weak in the faith; most could not read, most were unfamiliar with the Hebrew Scriptures in even the Septuagint form. Paul adapted the message of the Bible to a largely uneducated market. Granted, this market still exists today, but do you count yourself as part of it? To be \\\"weak in the faith\\\" is not missing the mark (hamartia) if you do the best that your education allows. Are you doing the best?   Let me make clear that the \\\"Law\\\" is none other than the Pentateuch of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. What did Jesus say about the \\\"Law\\\" in Matt5:14-19? Where did Jesus say that the \\\"Law\\\" only applies to Jews and that Gentiles are above the \\\"Law\\\"?   Who acknowledged this fact? On what basis? Are we extra-biblical at this point? Why not also acknowledge that the Bhagavad-Gita is the only relevant text for Gentiles, after all we see in the Bible that it was Magus from the east who observed the star-signs of Jesus? Why bother with any texts at all? Why not just follow whatever the Church has to say?   I don't see how you can say this with a straight face. Are you a follower of Christ, or do you follow someone else? Are you saying that the words of Jesus only apply to Jews?   How Jewish was Paul after he changed his name from Saul?   Who says Gentile Christians are not covered by the first five books? Who says that Gentile Christians are above the Ten Commandments?   You're implying that Jesus' words are valid only for Jews. Is this really what you mean to say? You do realize that you are gutting rather large portions of the Bible? When you read Jesus' words, did you ever consider that maybe, just maybe Jesus is talking to you, no matter what your race or sex? If the Hebrew Scriptures and the Gospel accounts of Jesus are only directed to Jews, why were they translated into English?   As Paul would call him, one who was weak in the faith.   Which is more important: 1) The recorded word of Jesus or 2) Indications that you can deduce from the Bible? Was Jesus God only of the Jews, or God of all humankind of all race and sex?   This is your understanding of Paul. Compare this to the word of Jesus. Are you Christian or Pauline?   Again, this is your understanding of Paul. Did Jesus say that the Law was an \\\"impossible standard?\\\" Did Jesus say that He superceded the Law? Are you Christian or Pauline?   You acknowledge that it is *your* reading of Paul. What did Jesus say? Can you deny that Matt5:14-19 is quite clear in its meaning? Are you  Christian or Pauline?   When did Jesus say that the purpose of the Law was conviction of sin?   Please reread Matt5:14-19. Are you Christian or Pauline?   Are you saying that the Ten Commandments are ceremonial details?   You call observance of the Sabbath, the day on which the Lord rested, ceremonial? Has circumcision been superceded for Christians?  ....  Are you Christian or Pauline?  [Both.  There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is not, at least not in this case.  Jesus did not deal explicitly with the question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  That's why I have to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.  As to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studies of Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I can't come up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, various Christian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and in other newsgroups.  Mat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid.  It does not say that it applies to Gentiles.  And yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on the Sabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when you're looking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.  I'm not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, it's unfortunate the Jesus didn't answer the question directly.  However we do know (1) what the 1st Cent. Jewish approach was, (2) how Jesus dealt with at least one Gentile, and (3) how Jesus' disciples dealt with the issue when it became more acute (I'm referring to Acts 15 more than Paul).  Given that these are all in agreement, I don't see that there's a big problem.\",\"In Windows I created a permanent Swap-file of 7771Kb as win3.1 recommended me to do that (32bit access).

A family sedan designed to be operable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph because you added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much larger engine.  That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine.  They didn't even bother improving the *brakes.*  The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power plant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications. I have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a brick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something I personally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is inadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of the car is not up to par.  I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind.  It didn't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much cheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these cars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.  There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought it up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe the following to be true:  1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here. 2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than    they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them    far more predictable than most US highways. 3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have    speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in    the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not    much higher than 120km/h.  I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph (nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.  Some people have no respect for their own lives.

Here is a reply to one of the letters.  Seems to me that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell!]    Your using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers.  Of course, in your termonology, God could not \\\"cease to exist.\\\"  However, that is not what death ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see that it signifies \\\"separation.\\\"  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is the reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one member of the Godhead was separated from the other two.    I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived.  She was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my \\\"girlfriend\\\" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were separated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided that she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was death.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not because He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go there.      When I rebelled against my earthly father, he spanked me.  I found no wisdom in that until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued on my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and unloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us do as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh.  You have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.     This may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.  Jesus most certainly felt the \\\"pinpricks\\\" of life.  As the Scripture say:  Heb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.  The kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes when He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine to think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  \\\"The Consciousness of Christ.\\\"  I have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study, including clh.    It is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually suffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we do.  He \\\"grew in knowledge.\\\"  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose to be taught.  It is my understanding that He was \\\"led of the Spirit\\\" to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and Jesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him, the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise.  That is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was living sequential history as you or I.    Maybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not.   I was once a member of that club.  THe \\\"free thinker\\\" is a glorious ideal.  By contrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right.  But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his \\\"rational doubt\\\" when in fact he was led to it by his \\\"faith\\\".  He must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a \\\"free thinker\\\" to criticize the Christian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize him as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.  Pascal pointed out that \\\"sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.  Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.\\\"  The fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms, hence the term \\\"a\\\"-theist.  Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In my campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember.  However, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word, every point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.  That is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out \\\"Look, your fly is undone!\\\"  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity.  The answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on presuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral.  In other words, another myth.    Presuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence.   Of course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first \\\"Highlander\\\" movie.  But again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of God.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His prophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you are to reject God's annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct understanding of Himself.\",\"    Uh, right.  You also forgot that you can't get an RBI (barring a HR) with nobody on base.  What fraction of all runs come on solo HR?  Most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the batter did something good.  I use the phrase \\\"happened to be\\\" advisedly. Lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the most ability to \\\"turn it up a notch\\\" in clutch/RBI/whatever situations, and what they've found is that there is no evidence that *anyone* has such an ability to any measurable extent.  There are no clutch hitters.  People who tend to do things that *would* cause an RBI if there were somebody on base end up getting RBIs proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by being in position.

(Please note, this is *not* in any way an indication I don't believe you or that you're not correct, but when the drop occured is relevant.)             The primary objection (beyond ones based on the ideal of RKBA that it is simply not something the government should do) is that it makes guns a play-thing and tool of the rich and connected. It discriminates against the poor.         Is self-defense considered appropriate, and if so, under what conditions?  (Are you allowed, for instance to get a gun for protection if you're going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular basis or have been threatened.)          This has been suggested in the U.S., and generally supported among gun owners.  What many object to is that many, if not most, proposals contain a sort of \\\"gotcha\\\" clause which allows an arbitrary denial, even if you qualify in every way.          At this point, it should be pointed out that in general a driver's licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like its European counterpart.  I understand getting one is far more difficult there than here.  In the U.S. it's a joke.          But my usual objection is that you're discussing two different things.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver's license is a permit to operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary to own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, the ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise from the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations for behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance, which is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get past legally, since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on public property, but in restricting activity on private property.                         This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have a difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions, where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different as from one country in Europe to another).          Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow concealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can be either a state or local restriciton.                 The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual affecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually get is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within this group, here defined as \\\"people who own guns,\\\") are adversely affecting  the rights of some other group.           If for instance, \\\"Bob\\\" were using his gun to attack \\\"Steve,\\\" you'd have a point.  But essentially what we're discussing is that becuase some person who qualifies as a member of the group \\\"people who own guns\\\" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is told that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's rights.  It's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited by one.          The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to what extent guns and gun legislation impact those.          Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn't have to fear that other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us. But currently we don't have that option.  Nor do I expect we will.          No state does.  In any case, there's a limit to which the state may enforce it's \\\"wisdom\\\" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise concept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be \\\"unwise\\\" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept.             I'll raise my hand against driver's licenses.  As currently implemented they're a waste of time and little more than revanue generation for the State and ignored by a startling number of drivers.  It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody else killed, or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year old will have picked up riding around in his parents car.

I received a response from someone at Seagate (Sorry I  trashed the message) stating that most newer drives (Seagates at the  least) can very well compensate for gravity.  This means that a  horizontally formatted drive can be later placed vertically with no data  integrity problems.  The only way that newer drives cannot work is if you  have varying forces (shaking, bouncing, etc) so don't place the drive on  it's side on a rocking chair :).  What constitutes a 'newer' drive I  don't know, try calling your drive manufacturer.

That's why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you want one, you are still innocent until proven guilty.  Cops are not the only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes, anyone who witnesses a crime can do so.  Go to the Highway Patrol and explain the situation, give them a description of the car and the license number, and tell them the specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute (ie, search the Vehicle Code and have the section number handy).  Fill out the ticket and sign it.  It will go through the same system any ticket a cop writes goes through.  If contested, you will have to appear in court to prosecute.  Your word will not carry the same weight as a cop's. \",\"or there   Okay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.  The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was because of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by scanning this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines).  When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \\\"I want to play a mono sound\\\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted the documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound.  Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from the IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.  Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware, and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase works. On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra 700/900/950 at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel only. Both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification, but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.  If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their games will only come out the left on some games.  The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related. It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what machine you have.  Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list: and also Hellcats, Super Tetris Oxyd (and many more, these are just what I've tested)  Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.   Other games you list: and also PGA Tour Golf Civilization (and more, these are again only from personal experience)  Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.  The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT! Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to do, but I'm going say it anyway. Stop cheating on sound! Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period is about to end. The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will work even better soon, so use it.  In conclusion: To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug. To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all hardware.   Have fun.  Disclaimer number 1: I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed. So don't write me with sound questions.  Disclaimer number 2: If it says up above that I wrote anything like \\\"the grace period is about to end\\\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that.

It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you very much).   well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell me the order of the wires.   there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.   if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.   btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of little boxes). Oh, well . . .   one more thing: in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on the newer models are different from the connection used on the plus--- you're right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plus and connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. in other words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible. it's merely a matter of finding out the correct order.   omt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solution so others can, too. thanx for the input.\",\"  Well, some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3MHz bus, 16 bits wide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3M bytes/sec.  Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5MB/s, which is the commonly-used figure for ISA bus speed.  However, I believe a two-clock transfer is possible (0 wait states).\",\"       The Bill of Rights, as far as I can see, does not once refer to \\\"citizens\\\", but it makes several references to \\\"people\\\". For example, Article IV: \\\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated\\\"; Article V: \\\"no person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment by a Grand Jury ...  nor shall any person ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\\\"; Article VIII: \\\"excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted\\\".  Now I've never heard that Constitutional rights apply only to citizens; aren't they meant to apply equally to all *persons* living in the U.S.? Whether slaves were considered \\\"not human\\\" I don't know, but it seems that a case could be made that they weren't treated as \\\"people\\\" as defined in the Bill of Rights. And since the nation is nominally based on the Declaration of Independence which states that \\\"all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness\\\", it would also seem that slaves would not follow under this definition of humanity. \",\"  Are you sure that he needs a two way converter?

You are the biggest liar I have ever seen.This example showed me that tomorrow you can lie again, and you may try to make me a liar this time.So I decided not to read your articles and not to write answers to you.I also advise all the netters to do the same.We can not prevent your lies, but at least we may save time by not dealing with your lies.  And for the following line:  I also return all the insults you wrote about Mutlu to you. I hope you will be drowned in your lies.

Please, can you tell us why those quotes are \\\"crap\\\"?..because you do not   like them!!!...because they really exist...why?    As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source   given by Serdar Argic ..      You couldn't reject it...      Here we go again..  In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give   the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!  (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of  pages, please ask by sct)      I really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924) What I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in the given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your groundless accussations, etc.    [...]      I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)  and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published  in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you  are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..    Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)    First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You  called Serdar Argic a liar!..  I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...  (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)    And now, you are lying again and talking about \\\"modified,re-published book\\\" (without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..  (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was   first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty    well suited theories', as usual)    And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who  wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number  and page numbers again for the library use, which are:                    949.6 R 198       and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215                           Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying \\\"it is  not possible...\\\" ..If not, what is your point?    Differences in the number of pages?  Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..  No need to use the same book size and the same letter   charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!    The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year  first published..   And you tried to hide the whole point..  the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about  how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given   by Serdar Argic exist!!   It was the issue, wasn't-it?      you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway?     You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a \\\"crap\\\"..  People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still  has so many \\\"craps\\\" in the 1993.

You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel  that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum  you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed.

I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line,  lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan  to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is  nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in  x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship,  that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel  free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists, the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian criminal organizations.  Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and  those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.  Not a chance.  Serdar Argic\",\" But ultimately their hockey philosophies are like night and day...

Suzuki used to have an L designation, for example my former boss had a GS850L which had a seat a couple inches lower than the \\\"regular\\\" GS850, but it was certainly no cruiser.\",\" [Stuff deleted]     Will, there has been a lot of discussion going on about this over in s.r.c.b-s. I will make the case here though and try to help you out:  8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9).  Yes, it is by God's grace and our faith that we are saved.  We are not saved by what we do.  However,  15 If ye love me, keep my commandments. (John 14:15).  Keeping Christ's commandments is a \\\"work\\\" per se, and a demonstration of our love for him.  Also,  6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. 7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? 8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: 9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down. (Luke 13:6-9).  Again,  16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. (John 15:16).  It is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit.  What is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being love, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest in the actions that we carry out.  If a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things Christ commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith.  Asking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your pants is more important.  Good works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith, true faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable above speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs commands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit, then we shall be uprooted just like the tree.   It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for days about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a building and not hit the ground.  In other words, I can sit and tell you all day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really don't have that faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the test.  Words and talk mean nothing.  I could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, but this should be sufficient.  Hope it helped.

But lets ignore that for the moment.  The fundamental question is:Can the government stop me from using encryption?  Ignoring for the moment the question of patented processes (such as Public Keys), can the government stop me from using an encryption process?  If the answer is yes then what freedom we have in this country is truly gone and its time to get out the guns or the lawyers (depending upon which causes more damage and to whom).  However assuming that I can still encrypt things as I please, who cares about the clipper chip? As far as I'm concerned a phone line is insecure PERIOD. I don't care if they encrypt it 10 ways from sunday, if I didn't do the encrypting, I don't trust it. This is the attitude that everyone else should have.

The Jester\",\"I am having something very unusual happen.  First  some background on my system.  I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive,  and am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on  it.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician  Gold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by  having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is  necessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it,  and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard  drive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad  sectors a week.           Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with  an Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this  message twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program  and did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining  for new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about  sectors for a brief period of time.           I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the  exact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the  same error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went  to the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough  there was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG,  but removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors,  either audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the  cache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.           Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix  them, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are  no errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other  files, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them  for a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to  completely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through  the c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.           Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on  my hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in  about every 100 files are affected.             I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s  system, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about  smartdrv to help me out. \",\" How can you lie about something that no one knows for sure.

First, a rebuttle. Personally, I love under-dogs. Unlike  bandwagon jumpers, I abandon teams when they start winning. People that cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are afraid to be associated with something negative.   On this one point, I agree. The reason that people bash WASP's is  because they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top is going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top. If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people  for all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had  conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any better/worse than the whites did.  The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of the world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done (ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to the present generation who didn't participate in the crimes? Would it do  any good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stopped hundreds, even thousands, of years ago.   My opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let's change them. But don't blame me for what my ancestors did. It wouldn't settle anything anyway.   That's where you are dead wrong. You don't join up on a side just because they are winning. That makes you spineless. Winning, in high school and after high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't make you right. All the best causes in history were loosing causes (with only a couple exceptions). Winning only makes a difference to other people, not to yourself. And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care how you appear (ie. a Winner).   If you can't beat them, fight them every inch of the way.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \\\"At that moment the bottom fell out of Authur's mind.

The 27th was a short day at work, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided to go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes behind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24 Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the  car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit, and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and  her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to  45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help them. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?  When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was,  but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the  Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle around it. I ask, \\\"What's going on?\\\" Someone tells me, \\\"Come listen.\\\" Well they were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \\\"Brother Muslims, our time has come . . . \\\" and something else along that line. I didn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to  get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter.  New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And the comments started: \\\"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"There's no need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\\\" I even heard that: \\\"All  Moscow is behind us.\\\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this  was no joke. I quietly left and went home.  Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh,  that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of  things, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.  My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku.  I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and  shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly, like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a  demonstration and move slowly.  My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd people are shouting \\\"Down with the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"Death to the Armenians!\\\" I waited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street  on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned  and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26  Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there  was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same  kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside  from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.  My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of uneasy and said, \\\"No, let's stay at home instead.\\\" An hour went by, or maybe  an hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say exactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on the side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.  I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside, and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time  there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more  aggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration. They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run  again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I  followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was  leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one  side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square  and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There  was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals. I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \\\"We don't need  perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\\\" Now what did they  mean by \\\"living like we have been?\\\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else.  But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense  of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just  in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it  anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.  Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians'  apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't  hear them say \\\"kill them\\\" over the microphone, I only heard \\\"beat them and  drive them out.\\\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then another are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and  I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB. There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try  to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.  Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no demonstration, and I had to protect my family.  I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next to the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai- lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some- thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City  Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I  saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the  cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15  to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried  off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe  about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha.  When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was  about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He  has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I  have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of  people smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled  around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.  Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting.  I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am,  I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags.  And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the  street. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag,  which had \\\"Ermeni oryum\\\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \\\"Death to  Armenians!\\\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really know what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is Rafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark blue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His  family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on  Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars;  their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the  left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a  new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son  was carrying a flag that said \\\"Death to Armenians!\\\" I was surprised because  before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being  done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.  Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \\\"It's OK, it'll pass,  they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up.\\\" Naturally I didn't  want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And  this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't  see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't  handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking  and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and  hashish to put in a store window!  So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one  would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again,  the police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't  breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time.  True, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much- vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people  died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I  couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be  specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of  Sumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.  When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \\\"Let's go upstairs.\\\"  We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the  evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more. I stopped at \\\"The Corner,\\\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I  look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to  the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old.  The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed  toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person,  wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as  though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more  noise, and the glass was flying again.  We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor, there was really no way to defend yourself there.  In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town.  On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or  what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the  bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying  there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing you couldn't even see him.  That was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.

I can even imagine this being found legal and constitutional, since nothing is actually listened to until a valid warrant is issued and the keys are obtained.  Imagine archiving all pay-phone conversations, so if someone turns out to be a drug dealer, you can listen to all their past drug deals.  And archive calls to/from suspected Mafia members, potential terrorists, radicals, etc.  Imagine the convenience for the police of being able to get a warrant now and listening to all the calls the World Trade Center bombers made in the past year.  Since archiving would be such a powerful tool and so easy to do, why wouldn't it happen?\",\" Question: If a team uses 40 players in a season do you merely divide the total +/- by 40?

While I don't know the full scope of the activities of the EFF,  from what little I've seen I think it would be better to lobby for  strong cryptography through a distinct organization.  The EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex and pictures newsgroups at various universities. Horror stories about the contents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged models) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletin already raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only one step removed from the old \\\"crypto-wielding child molester\\\" argument.  An EFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the connection to child pornography and the like.  Similarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  In light of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this means that in a public debate it stands to be labelled as \\\"communist\\\", \\\"anarchist hackers\\\", radical, etc.    I don't know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for Social Responsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hysterical antinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political baggage.  Perhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography would best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existing group, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited to advocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein's question: does any suitable organization exist?  If not, what are you going to do about it?  Having mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations, I would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction: gathering the support of the NRA by emphasizing the RKBA side of the issue as well as the First-Amendment side.  \",\" No.  The idea was suggested around here during discussions of possible near-term commercial space activities.  One of the folks involved in those discussions, a spacecraft engineer named Preston Carter, passed the suggestion on to  some entreprenurial types, and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead with it.  Preston is now at LLNL, and is working with Space Marketing on  the sensors that might be carried.  Actually, that sounds unlikely.  I don't know what the launch vehicle would be, but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher -- certainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASA for, e.g.,  launch support would probably  cover NASA's incremental costs pretty well.   No, as noted, LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design, per  Clementine and related programs.  I'm sure folks around here would like to  see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure, but after all,  the U.S. did the Echo satellites long ago, and an advertising structure would not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was (or a parade balloon, for that matter).  While I happen to personally dislike the idea, mostly because I've got a background in astronomy, it's hardly vandalism -- it would be a short-lived intrusion on the night sky, doing no permanent damage and actually hurting only a small subset of astronomers.  On the other hand, it would certainly draw attention to space.     Which, unfortunately, this is not likely to contribute much to.   As far as I know, it's a purely commercial venture.  I gather it is being very seriously discussed with possible advertisers. Commercial projects, however, generally don't get \\\"funding\\\" -- they get \\\"customers\\\" -- whether it will have customers remains to be seen.  Nahh.

I am far less worried about \\\"the feds\\\" tapping my phone than high school  scanner surfers who get their kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and  cordless phone calls.  It would be stupid to rely on even a \\\"Clipperized\\\" channel for truly  sensitive material, but it *does* seem to finally offer a reasonable way to  guard against casual eavesdropping.  For example, even with my strong \\\"right  to bear arms\\\" view of the private right to possess and use strong  cryptosystems, the system as described provides enough security that I would  actually buy a cordless phone, and would be much less wary of using cellular  phones, walkie-talkies, and so on.  As long as it's only used for mass-market  voice scrambling, I actually don't see a problem with it.  If you want more security than it offers, use something different.  Use PKCS  for electronic mail, CELP over DES or triple DES with Diffie-Hellman key  exchange for your voice traffic, or whatever.

There are still many languages which we are not able to write, simply because the written version of the language has not yet been defined!

Bjorn\",\"Hello,    I have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the  newsgroup, and I think that they can be used to explain each other.   Unfortunately I don't have direct quotes handy...  1) Atheists believe that when they die, they die forever.  2) A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death    is unfair.    I don't see what the problem is!  To Christians, Hell is, by definition,  eternal death--exactly what atheists are expecting when they die.  There's no reason Hell has to be especially awful--to most people, eternal death is bad enough.   Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view, since the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such.  Personally, I don't think that people in Hell will be thrust into flame any more than I expect to Jesus with a double-edged sword issuing from his mouth--I treat both these statements as metaphorical.\",\"/(hudson) /Yes you do.  Who is to say that it is immoral for onesself to experience /pain or to be hurt in some other way.  Maybe unpleasant, but that doesn't /say anything about morality.  It violates free will, Hudson.    (me)  /(hudson) /Why is making someone a less productive member of society immoral?  Hudson, you are screwing up again.  Morality does not (I say again, DOES NOT) define only \\\"right and wrong\\\".  It also defines \\\"acceptable social behavior\\\", without any overtones of good and evil.  Picking up your trash is not really a right/wrong moral issue in the eternal sense of Good and Evil.  Yet it is moral in the sense that it is acceptable social behavior\\\".    Your definition of the word \\\"morality\\\" is what is causing you to trip over  yourself here.     /(me) /And since />I, selfish being that I am, want to maximize my gains from society, I will />not do anything to another member of society if that action might cut down />on how much benefit I can derive from society.  /(hudson) /Why is your benefit somehow related to morality.  Again, your definition is causing you to shoot yourself in the foot.      /(hudson) /What about if someone feels that their own personal benefit is enhanced /more than it would be damaged by depleting the overall resources of society? /Maybe something might hurt society, but it would help him immensly?  That is irrational thinking.    There may also be people out there who think that death by atomic  destruction is  a sublime and wonderful thing. I am not going to let them execute that idea just because they want to do it.   Simply because I let people make up their minds about what morals they have doesn't prevent me from spotting and stopping a madman when I see one, Hudson.  And even then, I will only stop him when he interferes  with me and my life.  That is the difference between me and you:  you want to interfere in people's lives even when they aren't affecting you.        /(hudson) /The central character in Dostoevsky's novel, Crime and Punishment,  /(R something or other) reasoned that if killed this old Jewish woman and /stole her money to educate and establish himself financially, he could /make a great contribution to society.  He reasoned that she was not of  /much profit to society.  She just collected rents, and hoarded money.   One of the central points of any (that's ANY) moral system is that is has to be internally consistent.    By killing her, the character had to accept the premise that the ends justify the means.  If he accepted that premise, then (in order to be consistent), he must accept the idea that some day another person may apply the same standard to HIS life.  Now, if he is unwilling to accept this premise (which he will not be willing to accept), then he has behaved inconsistently with his own moral standard.      /(me) /[football example deleted]  /(hudson) /Now suppose a freshman on the bench will only get to play if one of the /players in the field/on the court is injured (or killed.)  This freshman /wants to play in the big game so a talent scout can see him.  If he hurts /a player on the team, it might slightly lessen the chances of the team to /win, but he might gain great personal benefit.  So, operating on purely /selfish (immorally selfish) motives, he arranges for a sniper to shoot a /team player in the leg.  He gets to play in front of the talent scout.  /Did that freshman behave morally?  /Selfish intentions may sometimes generate (apparently) moral actions, but /not always.    Two problems right off the bat:  1.  The problem with your analogy is that it doesn't address the goal that I started with:  winning the game.  Playing in front of the talent scout != winning the game.  Try creating the same analogy and keep the ultimate goal the same, will you?\",\"    Well, I am not Andy, but if you had familiarized yourself with some of the current theories/hypotheses about abiogenesis before posting :-), you would be aware of the fact that none of them claims that proteins were assembled randomly from amino acids.

I was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist, so I have stated this Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about 18.  For some reason, I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the resurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean the raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:  1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was  pretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right now.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the \\\"great judgement\\\" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day). I was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the church -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my \\\"soul\\\" (which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?  2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms  that my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My physical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal so it can be tortured for all eternity?  3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical place to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth? Do you think we could find it if we dig?  Mark Schnitzius schnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.edu Univ. of Central Florida  [There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I think the most common view is that final disposition does not occur until a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the meantime, some believe that people \\\"sleep\\\" until the final resurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death to the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe that souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then. There are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.  The new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a different \\\"technology\\\" than the current one, one which is not mortal. (Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus' resurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not subject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other, but I don't think most people claim to know the details.  I don't think I'd say it's the same atoms.  I'd assume there would be some analog of a physical place, but I wouldn't expect to find it under the earth or up in the sky.  I'd suspect that it's in another dimension, outside this physical world, or whatever.  But again, we have little in the way of details.\",\" HI,     Recently, when I run the Norton Disk surface test, I realize a slow down in harddisk accessing.  At begining of the test, the harddisk will be checked at the speed that usually is.  As the surface test scaned half way through my harddisk, a tremendous slow down occured.  The expected time for operation will jump from 3 to 6 minutes.  I try to use some of the harddisk tools to check if there is any physical damage to my harddisk and report always turn out to be none.  The surface test only slow down for a certain section of the disk and turn back to the original speed after it gets over the section.

Well, who cares.  First let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the Clipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:  The chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs general encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB ECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm consists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data seems to be 64 Bit? Yes. So if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when  Clipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key.  (Or is it one key per direction ?) They can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however. Somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip which is now ready to work. The clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits. These 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number with 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip) At beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??) before sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper chip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number, and the session key. This might look like X{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number} where X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key. This family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???) After that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet being encrypted and decrypted by Clipper.  Denning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160 Bit's.  Now, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not being an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in this scheme, which might be exploited by several parties.  As far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the  obvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing the serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can't imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources for the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money.  Then, the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security could (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits each, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let's simply assume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or law enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrows and l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on and so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding chip is compromised forever. Not very clever, IMHO [ :-)) ]. How about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that the police (or whoever) want's to listen to? Escrows could then simply decode this session-key and send it back to police. (And would naturally not do this after the warrant has expired...) This would be a better technical solution, but I guess politics will not work that way.  Apparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes of intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter- cept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes the right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over there, I have no idea who is allowed to tap, and who not) This certainly means that watched communi- cations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company to the FBI, if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this means as far as I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching- company, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-key will not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable by anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis!  What do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ECB mode, and the first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the session key would not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. Shouldn't be so difficult to do *that* :^)  And now a last point, for the other side. After all I have read and heard about Clipper (not the programming language for dBase, is it ? [:-)]) it seems to have many advantages, which shold not be overseen!

(Of course these could all be wrong.....)   from                        THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                Dorothy Denning                            Revised, April 21, 1993  . . .  The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  . . .  ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.  Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,   which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed.  ------------------  suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip, but did not know F, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from if law enforcement field     E[E[K; U] + N; F] not knowing N would might make this much harder.  Now suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not), If I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know U for a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for the other party.  If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field, since I could make my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also allows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are saying but I could know who you are saying it too.  Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of messages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the key generation method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that matter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U's will be chosen from know weak keys for the system.  Obviously the compromise of F would be a disaster, both to law enforcement for whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that it is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot of people (more then 1) know what it is (and if some \\\"panel of experts\\\" is going to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forget grinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.  So, am I wrong? Or are these problems.\",\"taken.  Hum, I guess this has some significance as opposed to having an incredible drop during the last days in office.

For one, you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the Bible.  Seems that ignorance has you mastered.  How about sexual sins?  Gotta any of those secret desires in your head that you harbor but can get control of?   Do you dehumanize women when they walk past you?  Do you degrade them to a sex object in your head?  Are you the master of that kind of thinking?  Do you insult people unknowingly, then regret it later.  Yet do it again the next time opportunity presents itself?  Are you truly the master of yourself?  I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times. That I sometimes say things I do want to say, and then repeat my mistake unwantingly.  I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect of my being.  There are times I know I shouldn't say something, but then say it anyway.  There are times I simply forget a lesson. I, in fact, am not my own master.  I need help.  Jesus promised me this help.  And I took him up on his offer.  I have willfully let Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than I myself do.  And why not?  Does not the creator know his creation better than the creation?  Does Toyota know what's better for the Corolla than the Corolla?   Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you.  Because Brian, you enjoy not having a clue about the Bible.       Can you witness motherly love with your senses?  How does caring and concern for you register with your senses?  If nothing registers to you other than what you can see, taste, smell, hear and touch, then you better become a Vulcan and fast.  You better get rid of your emotions.  And I do have a good reason to believe what I do.    The topic was about my God and your lack of knowledge about what my God says.   My God says that you will not CEASE EXISTING.  You have life forever.  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal torment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to  live it in paradise with God.  That is what my God says.  And that was the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  It's wishful thinking.    Is this the religion of Kendigianism?  Most people are not Christian.  Most people, including Christians,  are not fond of feeling that they are imperfect.  Is \\\"the world an undesireable place\\\" a doctrine of Kendigianism?  It has nothing to do with my God.  Does Kendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship? Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again?   Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the priest tells them like good little sheep?  Mine doesn't.  Is this a bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being  ignorant of the Bible?  Brian, following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism. You would find any of your doctrines in the Bible.   I don't follow Kendigianism. I follow Christ.   Also, to try to again show you your ignorance of Christ and the Bible in regards to \\\"priests\\\",  have you not read about the sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8?  Have you not read what the purpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should NOT be priests today?  Yes, guess what?  The Catholics messed up.  I do not follow Catholicism or any \\\"ism.\\\"  I follow Christ.   Why would you want to live a good life? To you, you die and that's it.  Don't contradict yourself.  You have no reason to live a good life.  It doesn't do you any good in the end.  Your life doesn't do anybody else any good  either because everyone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading a good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?   Has the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead. Jesus was sacrified to fufill the Old Testament sacrificial system in its every detail.  Jesus's death was like a seed.  He needed to fall to the ground so that many new lives would take root.  Did you miss the entire John passage as well?      Forget that I am a person.  Forget that I know how to type.  Forget that I know how to put a sentence together.  Forget that I know how to send e-mail.   Forget my existence.  Proove to me that I exist.  . \",\"   Yeah.  I don't use the clutch all the time either.

But I'll add another observation: if the chip does become a standard, the algorithm won't _remain_ secret.  Leaving the government with the only remaining option: to make use of un-escrowed keys illegal.

Rob\",\" You're getting warmer.  The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be depressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damned thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just about (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working correctly is totally drop safe.  Now, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single documented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because he failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the proprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely prevented the office from getting shot.  The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire. This does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down intentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a 'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else. By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece. From the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of firing it.  The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that the firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the wide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be familiar with that particular type of firearm.\",\"If gamma ray bursters are extragalactic, would absorption from the galaxy be expected?

Turn the power off      Disconnect the battery to the CMOS chip      Turn the power on      Get into setup upon getting the CMOS configuration error      Set up the CMOS      Exit the setup with [F10]  (phoenix bios)      Ignore the diskette 0 seek error and press [F1]  The computer then boots normally.  Both hard drives are accessible but the floppy drives are not.  I can back up over the network and such, but if I need to reboot, I have to turn off the computer and repeat the steps above.  If I simply <Ctl>-<Alt>-<Del>, the computer hangs after the memory test.  Does this sound like the CMOS chip is fried?  Can I buy another one? Where?  Thank you for your kind attention.  john\",\"Isn't this what HIV is about - the \\\"normal immune response\\\" to an exposure?   I had electrical pulse nerve testing done a while back.  The needles were taken from a dirty drawer in an instrument cart and were most certainly NOT sterile or even clean for that matter.  More than likely they were fresh from the previous patient.  I WAS concerned, but I kept my mouth shut.  I probably should have raised hell!\",\" I noticed this dead horse in your Keywords line. Is this the famous scarlet horse of Babylon that the Beast (that's 666 for you illuminatti) rides on in those wonderful mediaeval manuscripts. If so, I fear your announcement that the old girl is dead may be premature. I bet $20 on her to place in the 6th race at The Downs last Sunday, and she slid in a bad fifth. So she is not dead. She is just comatose. (like god that way, I suppose).  Ninja Gourmet Will fight for food.\\u001b  \",\" Does anyone out there have the toll-free (catalog request and order line) for Heathkit/Zenith?  Please post the number if you've got it!  Thanks. \",\" Hmm - I don't think you and I are thinking of the same thing. I was the original poster, BTW. The accelerator that I'm talking about almost certainly uses a 68HC000, according to the footnotes in the Supra ad. It only costs $199 list, so I really doubt if it has a 28 MHz 68030 inside.  It's called the Supra 28, or Supra Turbo 28. There's an external A500 model, and an internal A2000 model.  BTW, does anyone know if a 28Mhz 68HC010 exists? -- Griff Miller >  Griff.Miller@waii.com  < use this for email.        *** My opinions are mine, not Western's. ***\",\"  I think you need the EMM386.EXE noems This will let the expanded mem be active but not use any, therefore this will give you more extended mem for windows yet have all the bases covered.

Wouldn't it just make more sense to find some way to cut down on the cost of malpractice insurance?  And maybe that's not such a good thing. I also read somewhere that it is next to impossible in Canada to litigate against the health system-class action suits are nearly impossible, and you can't sue the provincial health officials at all.   Oh no. Don't let the AMA know about this. They have enough power as it is. Ask most Americans whether they'd like the doctors' lobby to get more powerful.   Well, yeah, tell us about the National Defense Medical Centre outside Ottawa. Theoretically it's limited to service personnel, but some studies I've heard about have suggested that about half the patients there are civilians who not only have connections but aren't \\\"urgent\\\" at all.  The problem is, in a system where hospitals' annual budgets are approved by the government, how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions? I bet that if you're an MP or MPP, or good friends with one, you're put on any hospital's \\\"urgent\\\" care list no matter how minor your problem. Which is OK  unless you're someone who gets bumped off the list for some bigshot.   Hmm. How much difference would it make in the figure of percentage of GNP spent on health care if dentistry and optometry were included in the accounting?  Maybe Canada spends proportionately just as much on health care as we do.   So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse. Bob Rae, the second least popular man in Ontario, warned Ontarians a few years ago that if they didn't stop cross-border shopping in such huge numbers, \\\"the services they expect from the province just won't be there in a few years\\\" (Fortunately for them (and less fortunately for the retailers here in Western New York) the  Canadian dollar went back to a more realistic value). He didn't say so, but I knew he meant the OHIP. What would happen if his warning turned out to be the  truth? Would the private insurers take up the slack? They'd be under no  obligation to. Of course, they could eventually make money again, but if what you say is true, they'd be loathe to do so (and out of practice in handling  such basic services, too).   Would that it were free. Americans would start another revolution if they had to pay taxes at Canadian rates. \",\"We're about ready to take a bold step into the 90s around here by accelerating our rather large collection of stock MacPlus computers.

It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in, therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft, or 75 Statute miles.  Now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss type, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength. Let us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical  strength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant section column.    A constant section column is not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section as you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound load to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in calculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross sectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile  below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.  The next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical limit on area, although there will be practical limits based on how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how much load you need to support on the ground (for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support.  Let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction cost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites, assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure is just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass ratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower height becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant atmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses will be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity, but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus they represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting from the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.  This analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind loads.  These will require more structural support over the first 15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low enough value for it not to be a big factor.

Actually, the words \\\"A well regulated Milita, being necessary to the security of a free state\\\" is a present participle, used as an adjective to modify 'militia', which is followed by the main clause of the sentence, the subject being 'the right', the verb 'shall'.  It asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for maintaining a milita.  The sentence doesn't restrict the right, or state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other than the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a right of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First, Fourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment. The existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the amendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the right to bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of a free state. In other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep and bear arms is UNCONDITIONAL.    The final word on liberties and rights should not belong \\\"to the many\\\".

As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye  stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population  there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately,  the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass  graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed  what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.  The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of  oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot  officials and their violation of the co-founder status of  the Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat  engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution  to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked  Turkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and  only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues  consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories  to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply  was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at  all. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which  was openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece.  Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish  population, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder of the republic with the Greek population.  The Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-minded Greeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with a minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their  autonomy in a separate republic.  Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would rather not be involved with the island. But, given the dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish population in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate of the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots of their rights, liberties and their very lives.

We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is, is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of us who have bikes are familiar.  Let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its own, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to get rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches to transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to remain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike, through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the same way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along  a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change  surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact  patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It  probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice,  but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like  because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a  better way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch forces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface. You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it was the rotation that did it.  Looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple. Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them about the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels. How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not sideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski or skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels. I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like that, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect. Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try one of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very much like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn. So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's, a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have countersteering.  Conclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have motorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what real effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations of how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm  willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering.   If you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's behaviour is consistent with it.

Days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real OS. I can see why they have such question. Ms-windows confuses many people. Microsoft simulated Mac, but it did a lousy job.  For example:  (1) You can not create hierarchy groups. There is no way to create a group     in a group. (If you know how, please tell me.) (2) Too many system parameters to take care of.  (3) uncomplete documentation. It's not easy to find the reason why causes     an unpredictable error. (4) Group deleting/file deleting     After deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files.     But if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full     of nonsense files. (5) share problem     Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some     language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. You just     can not open or save the program if it is loaded. It makes sense to     prevent from saving, but not opening.  Microsoft try to compromise between DOS and windows, but they just make  ms-windows a graphical DOS with capacity doing mutiple DOS jobs;  the worst thing is they complicate the environment. The orginal purpose of ms-windows should be to simplify the environment, and make PC easier  to use.      It's by no means easy to satisfy everybody, but if Microsoft want to keep their reputations, they should evaluate the user interface more carefully before products distribute.    No flame, please.\",\"  Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation in Australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this approach.  It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_ (i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences. The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case. You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits?  There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently, because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor- General's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of controlling the population is still considered to be controlled shooting.   Some people take satisfaction (IMHO, legitimate satisfaction) in eating food that they have harvested themselves.  The pleasure derived from hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables grown in your own garden (and, in general, game meat is probably much  freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or the supermarket).   By \\\"cannot now be justified\\\" I guess you mean that you personally don't see any justification.  Fine--but what makes your opinion so important?   Certainly the last point is correct.

This experience includes study of things that I may not have experienced directly.  But even then, I can only understand the studies to the extent to which I can relate what I study back to what I have experienced.  Which means that by beliefs about God are directly related to my experience of God.  Having experienced God, I try to make sense of that experience.  I study religion and read the Bible.  I find things that echo what I have already experienced.  Out of this I build my beliefs.  I also find things that don't match my experience.  That doesn't make them false.  They just don't match my experience.  Maybe I will understand that stuff later.  I don't know.  Maybe all of my beliefs are wrong.  I can change my beliefs.  If someone else has beliefs that are different from mine, so what. Neither of us are necessarily wrong.  Someone else is making sense out of a different set of experiences.  Even though we have different explanations and beliefs, if we talk we might even discover that the underlying experiences are similar.  Some people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in one form, and usually has a single revelation.  The more dogmatic and inflexible the belief system, the more arrogant it will appear to an outsider.  There is another approach possible, however.  God is a mystery.  I am trying to solve the mystery, so I look at the evidence available to me.  I try to arrive at the best understanding that I can based on the evidence.  New evidence may cause me to change my understanding.  When I encounter someone with a different belief than my own, it isn't a threat, it is an opportunity to perhaps discover something new about this mystery I can never fully comprehend.

For all intensive purposes (papers, letters, resumes), I treat my Deskjet like a laser printer (You *do* have to look a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters).  Only one grudge, the ink that HP gives you does smudge rather quickly in the presence of moisture (Even though the ink is waterproof).  However, you would have to spend about $500 more for laser quality.  The cannon bubblejets are nice, however they don't seem to have as much support (eg: drivers for popular programs) as the HP ink-jets. Also HP Deskjet (regular,plus,500,500c) accepts xerox paper (I believe that the cut-sheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet).  If you don't mind refilling your printer with cheap ink (say fountain-pen ink), then the HP deskjets are *very* cheap to maintain (I paid $3.50 for my last bottle of ink and I expect it to last 9 months).    -Kimball (who doesn't work for HP, but just loves his printer     very much!)\",\"Can someone give me the title of a good VGA graphics programming book?

There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and Alomar is not a home run hitter.   Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league.

They are posted with his permission.  The implications of some details are fascinating.  ------- Date: Sat, 17 Apr 93 23:05:23 PDT From: \\\"Martin Hellman\\\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu> To: (a long list of recipients) Subject: Clipper Chip   Most of you have seen the announcement in Friday's NY Times, etc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology) announcing the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" crypto device. Several messges on the net have asked for more technical details, and some have been laboring under understandable misunderstandings given the lack of details in the news  articles. So here to help out is your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Friday to get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing details. I was told the info was public, so here it is (the cc of this to Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my facts since I assume he is aware of all this; please let me know if I have anything wrong):  The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in  Silicon. Each chip will have two secret, 80-bit keys. One will be the  same for all chips (ie a system-wide key) and the other will be unit  specific. I don't know what NIST and NSA will call them, but I will  call them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message.  The IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so  that the system key can be kept secret. (Aside: It is clear that  they also want to keep the algorithm secret and, in my opinion,  it may be as much for that as this stated purpose.) The unit key  will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1  and K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow  authorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be  decided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that  they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they  must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased.  When a law enforcement agency gets a court order, they will  present it to these two escrow authorities and receive K1 and  K2, thereby allowing access to the unit key UK.  In addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his  or her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key  plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be  encrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK,  and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part  message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK  producing       E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}  When a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law  enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information  flowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that  they may do this constantly on all links, with or without a  court order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links  over which a message will flow.] This gives the agency access to        E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number  in the above message. They then check the serial number  of the unit and see if it is on the \\\"watch list\\\" for which they  have a court order. If so, they will decrypt E[K; UK] to obtain K,  and then decrypt E[M; K] to obtain M.  I am still in the process of assessing this scheme, so please do  not take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed  scheme. All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme  more knowledgably. But I will say that the need for just one court  order worries me. I would feel more comfortable (though not  necessarily comfortable!) if two separate court orders were  needed, one per escrow authority. While no explanation is needed, the following story adds some color: In researching some ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around, I spoke with Gerald Gunther, the constitutional law expert here at Stanford and he related the following story: When Edward Levi became Pres. Ford's attorney general (right after Watergate), he was visited by an FBI agent asking for \\\"the wiretap authorizations.\\\" When Levy asked for the details so he could review the cases as required by law, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned over 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not comply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear:  No single person or authority should have the power to authorize wiretaps (or worse yet, divulging of personal keys). Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi and sometimes a John Mitchell.

I thought the whole idea of God coming down to earth to live as one of us \\\"subject to sin and death\\\" (as one of the consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was that Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity, then Jesus \\\"fully human\\\" (Nicea) would not be \\\"subject to sin\\\", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning, because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguish between \\\"human\\\" and \\\"fallen human\\\" makes Jesus less like one of us at the time we need him most.   First, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius's version -- they  were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical record suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as extreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history) claimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing (I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean, in the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \\\"uncreate\\\" -- surely even  Arians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius's opponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed that she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require two seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because Mary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely, if you accept \\\"Nestorianism\\\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined, a la Chalcedon.  Second, I am not sure that \\\"Nestorianism\\\" is not a better alternative than the orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think rather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate nature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine nature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature prevailed.  Comments on the above warmly appreciated.  Jason Albert  [There may be differences in what we mean by \\\"subject to sin\\\".  The original complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call Jesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree that Jesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by not succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do not have to sin in order to be human.  I again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I agree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to think that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in fact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was not Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of the correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he got the better of them.  However, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to Chalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least \\\"rash and dogmatic\\\" (as the editor of \\\"The Christological Controversy\\\" refers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As regular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an impediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I think are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from Cyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \\\"To attribute also to [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics of the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother, either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the Greeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and Apollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the idea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine Logos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his fearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us who perpetrate the falsehood.\\\"  It's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between humanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based on exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \\\"to some degree\\\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it must be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos' participation in these things.  But there must be some sort of identification between the divine and human, or we don't have an incarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white terms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this area.  You say \\\"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus's human nature was in heaven.\\\"  I don't think that's required by orthodox doctrine.  It's the divine Logos that is eternal.\",\"Reply-to: apoylis@inode.com  Is there a FAQ on Cyrix 486DLC? If I missed it, could anyone please repost or email it to me? Thanks in advance.  ...
