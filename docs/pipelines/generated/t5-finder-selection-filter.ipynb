I think this is where the water is getting in.  When I first got it (had it for a month), one of the rear taillights fogged up with moisture.  I took it in to the dealer and they replaced the entire assembly.  It happened to the other one about 3 months later.  This time I happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there.  The dealer was more reluctant this time to replace it.  But I convinced them to fix it.  (They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the same problem.)  I haven't noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5 years, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again.  I'm going to try to take it back to get them to fix it again.  I'm real tempted to drill some vent and drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it.  This is getting very annoying.

Adding a bit to the key doubles the amount of work to be done in a straight brute-force attack, where you try every single possible key until one works.  Processing and storage requirements for this kind of attack on a 128-bit key seem like they ought to make it effectively impossible.  However, there may be other attacks whose difficulty is (for example) proportional to, say, 2**sqrt(n), or some such.

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is the National Security Agency (NSA)? * What are the US export regulations? * What is TEMPEST? * What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax? * What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch? * Is RSA patented? * What about the Voynich manuscript?   * What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?    The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It   was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and   has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is   known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,   and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the   world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of   cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many   years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break   many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national   security almost all information about the NSA is classified.    Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of   the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the   difference between public and private research in cryptography:    ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,   one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted   behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged   today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of   those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10   years has there in fact been widespread open research in   cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts   between these two research communities. Open research is common   quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open   exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in   scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with   responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,   countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can   a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might   undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?   One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would   force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one   must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with   political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most   scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have   occurred between government agencies and open researchers in   cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which   we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''  * What are the US export regulations?    In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control   export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export   Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by   the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office   of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized   by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule   of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent   requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see   everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.    The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting   discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what   people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which   go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to   consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in   jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at   least heard of the ITAR.  * What is TEMPEST?    TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer   equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that   information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at   quite a distance and with little effort.    Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext   is available this way.  * What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?    (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for   corrections.)    The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas   Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass   of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving   three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the   location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.   Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;   it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the   Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;   many documents have been tried as the key to B1.    Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various   means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:    The Beale Cypher Association   P.O. Box 975   Beaver Falls, PA 15010    You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the   line:    send index    in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.   (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher   floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,   says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)    Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of   problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI   and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.   Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this   string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an   explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this   string.  * What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?    The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis   on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with   pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes   articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in   English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,   Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.    Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;   less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent   to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.  * Is RSA patented?    Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.   For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been   granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral   issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information   about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of   the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as   ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other   technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.  * What about the Voynich manuscript?    nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the   subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list   is: <voynich-request@rand.org>    the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich\",\" Those who forward offensive posts to the sysadmin aren't curtailing anyones' freedom of speech.  The neo-nazi movement has a right to make speeches, say anything they want.  They do not have a right to have these speeches published by the N.Y. Times.  That depends on the Times analysis of the economic and to somewhat extent newsworthy value of those speeches.  Likewise to the sysadmin of this fellows system.  If he feels his resources are being used in a manner that is not in his best interests, or are perhaps embarassing to his organization, he will act just as the New York Times does, not to be a conduit for these ideas. The poster is after all free-loading off of someone else's pocket book when he posts.  He who controls the purse strings has the right to make the decision how he wants those funds spent or not spent.  Noone is going to put the poster in jail, unless he bombs a local building as a symbol of his hatred.  Freedom of Speech in no way equates to accessibility to conduits of information.  The market of ideas has its own \\\"natural selection\\\" process that weeds out the ga-ga from the credible ideas that are of importance.

One might find oneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near term that require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting a few weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December with preferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.  2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations of what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects beside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given to unsophisticated investors in late 1986 to \\\"sell now and save on taxes.\\\"  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similar advice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advice was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986), but merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates (without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).  It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal economic interest.  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless pulleys, though, this sort of thinking often fails to describe accurately what happens in the real world.  \",\"Here's a list of 800 numbers I have compiled from other sources...  anybody got anything to add?

Basically get the eci-freaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth.. You think this is crazy. Well in a way it is, but in a way it is reality.

Basically to make it so expensive to mine minerals in the US, unless you can by off the inspectors or tax collectors.. ascially what I understand from talking to a few miner friends  of mine, that they (the congress) propose to have a tax on the gross income of the mine, versus the adjusted income, also the state governments have there normal taxes. So by the time you get done, paying for materials, workers, and other expenses you can owe more than what you made. BAsically if you make a 1000.00 and spend 500. ofor expenses, you can owe 600.00 in federal taxes.. Bascially it is driving the miners off the land.. And the only peopel who benefit are the eco-freaks..

Yeah...I've seen you're grand mother...I bet she could.\",\"  Well, I've said that when an innocent person has been executed, this is objectively a murder.  However, who is at blame is another question. It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions-- realizing the risks--is to blame.   Yes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this.   And I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact, many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents.   But, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals on the road.  Again, the blame is on society.   Yes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do so much to prevent false witnesses.   Okay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not all such \\\"murders\\\" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong, no matter what the circumstances?   But, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of society shares this blame.  And, most people's definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an execution, is it?   Murder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing it at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim is.   Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth matters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That is, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.   But then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the conviction was unfair.   Yes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all possible information), we can't always determine the difference in our flawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible, but it still isn't objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn't matter if we *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.   But what we know has no effect on an objective system.   Why are you so sure?   Why is *your* reality important?   But, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely. And, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective system.   Well, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal. We can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible.   Yes, we all bear the responsibility.  Most people seem willing to do this.   We must realize the consequences of all our actions.  Why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack?   I don't think our country has an objective system, but I think such an objective system can exist, in theory.  Without omniscience, an objective system is not possible in practice.\",\"Hi Xperts, some simple questions for you:  I've seen a lot of different terms, which seem to mean the same thing.

Would _you_ turn one down if you had to \\\"clean\\\" an alley in E. St. Louis?\",\"     From what I read, the other fellow told Salameh how to put it together over the phone.  The bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type, so to put a (I assume complicated) sophisticated bomb together from instructions _over the phone_ (!) one must need some brains I would expect.    I read this in an article in \\\"The Australian Muslim Times\\\", the newspaper (weekly) of the Australian Muslim community.    If this is true, perhaps one of the Muslims based in North America (if they see this posting) can elaborate.       I don't deny this fact.  The thrust of my argument here is that   (a) Salameh is, according to US law, innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law.  As his guilt has not been established, it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.  (b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps have not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important  distinction.  I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say \\\"Muslim\\\".  In general, anyone who calls themselves a \\\"Muslim\\\" and does not do or  outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam is considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to Islam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a Muslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential principles, though, then one does leave Islam.  The term \\\"Muslim\\\" is to be contrasted with \\\"Mu'min\\\", which means \\\"true believer\\\".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is something known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you will not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism, because it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I, for example, am a \\\"true believer\\\" or not.  For example, I could just be putting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to what I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say \\\"Muslims\\\" we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in practice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By \\\"Muslim\\\" we do not necessarily mean \\\"Mu'min\\\", or \\\"true believer\\\" in Islam.\",\"Hi to all you PC gurus!

Be that as it may....  Clemens is always in this form, and Viola isn't really performing beyond what might reasonably have been expected. How do you know that the Sox are responding to them, and not to Al Bumbry, Hobson, or (my most likely suspect) new hitting coach Mike Easler? I certainly am more likely to give Easler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola.  This was the optimistic scenario, but not unreasonably so. He hasn't shown much power yet, though.  How can you tell that Dawson is providing the leadership? Perhaps it's Calderon? Perhaps it's Clemens and Viola? Maybe Hobson is finally showing those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybe it's all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not as well as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher.  In three games. Why don't we look at this one again in, say, July?  A bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don't forget that Zupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB's last year. Beware of small sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'd be a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be aware that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as long as he doesn't have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.  Ummm...sorry, no. I can buy the \\\"in the field\\\" part, and I think he'll be better at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he'll be a pretty good hitter, couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap. With a little luck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs, Ventura, and Palmer will all be better).   See, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500 is plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like \\\"could run away with the division\\\" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white coats. It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If Russell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitch just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could be better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're too stupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's a lefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.

He called them \\\"the Great Commission\\\" but this is NOT descriptive of Jesus's words in Matt. 10:15.  Matt. 10:14, Jerusalem Bible translation:   \\\"And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have  to say, as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust  from your feet.\\\"  Matt. 10:15:    \\\"I tell you solemnly, on the day of Judgment it will not    go as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with    that town.\\\"   \\\"> The above is a good description of Kaflowitz, who keeps harping on  > shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said next.\\\"    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                                ^^^^  The highlighted words refer to Matt 10:14 and 10:15 respectively.  And Dean countered:  \\\"Actually, this comment of your's is a perfect example of what an intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are, since I specifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreaty to spread the word.  In fact, it is the combination of the two statements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to characterize that as \\\"ignoring\\\" the instruction to spread the word is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are.\\\"  Of course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of \\\"instruction to spread the word.\\\"  All these quotes btw are from:  Message-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>   And I claim it correctly, because my question went:  \\\"Do you, too, measure the goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not a whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?\\\"  and the closest Dean came to an answer was:  \\\"Peter, Peter, Peter.  You're just so stupid, pretentious, dull, and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that the sport is all there is.\\\"  Of course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts in GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this, yet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:  \\\"So I now restore the answer to your question that you deleted.  If you're still unable to figure it out, ask a nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really doesn't take much sophistication to understand.\\\"  On top of which, I doubt that the \\\"answer\\\" is at all representative of Dean's true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus far are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean's  mind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken. One wonders whether Dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in all this.  He even dredges up a falsified account of events that transpired earlier on another thread:  \\\"You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ was in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the \\\"sins\\\" of other individuals.\\\" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  False.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins. That I made public announcements of the \\\"sins\\\" of others --\\\"sins\\\", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in the posts of others-- is a different matter.  Many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that they do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so I pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread, YOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.  Dean again:  \\\"You made an ass of yourself by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was somehow an attempt to \\\"paint Jews as plaster saints,\\\" thereby revealing your inability to understand the discussion as well as showing your dislike for people saying positive things about Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then claiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.\\\"  Actually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew who gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite according to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing Jewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as implicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.  I went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of the doubt in a post following my initial crack about \\\"plaster saints\\\",  suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.  In an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly distorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as the basis of one insult after another.\",\" One word \\\"HEAVY\\\".

P. A1.  NEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE   * INQUIRY: Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage    by a man who infiltrated political groups  By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.  SAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world, Roy Bullock was a small-time art dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District.  In reality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40 years.  His code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal, and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) in her Washington, D.C., office.  For a time, Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White Aryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes.  From police sources he obtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people.  And he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government to trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills.  These are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a former Los Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with police and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide intelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League.  Officials of the Anti-Defamation League, while denying any improper activity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation.  They have refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz.  Transcripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents released by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory.  At times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air with laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like \\\"Ironsides\\\" and \\\"Flipper.\\\"  On one occasion, Gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a pro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa, Israel.  Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any ties to Israel, Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him.  Shortly afterward, another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed him.  The court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard, a former CIA agent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League.  Gerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the FBI, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker.  Its contents included passports, driver's licenses and identification cards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for four American embassies in Central America; and a collection of blank birth certificates, Army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies.  Also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, a black hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos of blindfolded and chained men.  Investigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the ADL confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of one target group, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee.  Each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony, San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant.  The Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civil rights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. The ADL's fact-finding division, headed by Irwinn Suall in New York, enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists.   However, evidence seized from Bullock's computer shows he kept files on at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Earth Island Institute, the United Farm Workers, Jews for Jesus, Mother Jones magazine, the Center for Investigative Reporting, the Bo Gritz for President Committee, the Asian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP.  The computer files also included information on several members of Congress, including Pelosi, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey from the Bay Area.  In their statements, Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation League has collected information on political activists in the Los Angeles area for more than 30 years.  They said they worked closely with three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who specialized in intelligence work, a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism expert and a San Diego County Sheriff's Department intelligence officer.  A spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation, and the San Diego Sheriff's Department declined comment.  Bullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama.  Although he is not Jewish, he began working undercover as a volunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party.  Bullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by the ADL as an intelligence operative, he told authorities.  In the mid-1970s, he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the West Coast.  To keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneled through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has never missed a payment in more than 32 years, Bullock said.  \\\"I was an investigator for the ADL.  I investigated any and all anti-democratic movements,\\\" Bullock said.  \\\". . . Officially, I'm only a contract worker with Bruce Hochman.  That way, the league would not be officially connected with me.\\\"  Bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists to Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own name but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink.  \\\"I'm one of a kind,\\\" he told police.  In recent years, however, his ADL affiliation has increasingly become known, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him.  In the mid-1980s, he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police.  In part because of this investigation, he became close friends with Gerard, who at the time was working in the San Francisco police intelligence division.  Bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups.  An FBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group:  \\\"Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, and would share the reports with Gerard.  Bullock also gave the trash to Gerard for Gerard to examine.  Gerard would later return the trash to Bullock.\\\"  From a wide range of sources, Bullock compiled files on 9,876 individuals and more than 950 political groups.  Gerard, whose files contained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people.  In 1987, Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the South African government.  Bullock tells of meetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100 bills.  Bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources. Once he rewrote an innocuous item published by San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African Bishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli -- and submitted it as his own work.  Bullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence.  Bullock said he split about $16,000 from the South African government evenly with Gerard, telling him at one point, \\\"I may be gay but I'm a straight arrow.\\\"  In his interviews with the police and FBI, Bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law.  For example, Bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records and criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer.  And he said Gerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence files on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy.  Bullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation of Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League's San Francisco office.  Bullock seemed proud of his \\\"Operation Eavesdrop,\\\" in which he used a paid informant, code-named Scumbag, to help tap into a White Aryan Resistance phone message network, listening to the messages left by members of the right-wing group.  \\\"For a short time, it was wonderful,\\\" he told police.  In Los Angeles, ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a \\\"fact-finder\\\" to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups.  Among other things, he told San Francisco authorities, the Los Angeles ADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had \\\"anti-Israel leanings\\\" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such sentiment.  Gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he attempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a rival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies.  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival and threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hate group.  Gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the probe, providing considerable information about the ADL operation.  Unlike Bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the investigation.  Gurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewed by The Times. Bullock's attorney said his client would not comment.\",\"Hi to all out there.  We have this problem, and I'm not certain I'm solving it in the correct way.  I was wondering if anyone can shed light on this, or point me in the right place to look...

We do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen.  However, the calculations are mathematically highly complex, and must assume that the object's hole projects an image (resembling an ellipse if the tube is not parallel to the screen) in the centre of the screen.  However, it is unlikely that the object is placed so conveniently.    Firstly, we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse.  I cannot know what the angle between the tube and screen is.  Do I have to assume that they are parallel to do the transformation?  How do I do this transformation?  Secondly, there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar (the source--screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the screen).  How can I compensate the ellipse's axis for this image distortion?  So, please can anyone give us a few pointers here?  How do we transform the image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen, and how do I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen?

Jagr did not have a better season than      Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of      hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty      plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.       Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice      time per game and some measure of its \\\"quality\\\" (i.e., is the player put out      in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up      against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would      much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious      merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.  Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/- comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way play.  In my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the other hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get 90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.  (By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy floater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like overtime of playoff games). \",\": Oh, yeah?  Well---*I* know of ....  Anyways, cannibalism is much more commmon than those who feel that it is wrong (and then point out that the fact that western civilisation doesn't do it is PROOF positive that we are more advanced) would have us believe.  Cannibalism is often used in funeral ceremonies as a way of keeping the deceased loved one alive.  Many other cultures (including many American Indian cultures) eat/ate the flesh of slain enemies, often as a way of showing respect for the valor of the departed.

X X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters X       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or } X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536. X X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format: X X---entry--- Xrule: 1993 Xfix: y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry) Xtitle: title of entry        (see comments below) Xentry: Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0) Xdate: Date/time of submission in UTC     (see comments below) Xhost: Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested X Use tab indented lines if needed X---remark--- X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th X    column.  Blank lines are permitted. X---author--- Xname: your name Xorg: School/Company/Organization Xaddr: postal address X use tab indented lines to continue X don't forget to include the country Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain. X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines. Xanon: y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info) X---info--- XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section. X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2.

X X   It is suggested, but not required, that the title should X   incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors, X   consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X * The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X   to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() X   using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X * You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X   it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the X   ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same X   title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be X   sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X * With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above X   format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X   something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate X   Email message to the judges. X X * Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless X   'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X * To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X   each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X   should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X * The entry's remarks should include: X     - what this program does X     - how to run the program (sample args or input) X     - special compile or execution instructions, if any X     - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X     - information about any ---data--- files X     - why you think the program is obfuscated X     - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X     - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X * Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X   portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They X   should not be required to exist. X X   If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X   section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple X   ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X   each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: X X    'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed X    'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional X        digit, followed by '.c' X    your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X        title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->        | X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X * look at the original source X * convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X * run it through a C beautifier X * examine the algorithm X * lint it X * compile it X * execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting \\\"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake\\\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X #define d define X #d foo     <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X int i; X j;     <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       | X    integral type.  Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should    | X    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.       | X X int i; X char *c; X i[c];     <--- use c[i] instead X (i+3)[\\\"string\\\"];   <--- use \\\"string\\\"[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X * assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X * casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X * passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X * passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X * performing arithmetic on va_list variables X * using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X * are very hardware specific X * are very OS or Un*x version specific X      (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X       code is likely not to be) X * dump core or have compiler warnings X      (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X * won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X * abusing the build file to get around the size limit X * obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X * are longer than they need to be X * are similar to previous winners X * are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X * are as concise and small as they need to be X * do something at least quasi-interesting X * pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X * are portable X * are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X * MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X * make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X where this program differs from the contest rules, the X contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule: 1993 Xfix: n Xtitle: chonglab Xentry: 0 Xdate: Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost: Un*x v6, pdp11/45 X 2.9BSD, pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.

If an entry wins, we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition, X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award, X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X * Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X * Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X  cc prog.c -o special_name  need special binary X X     or  rm -f special_src.c   need special source X  cp prog.c special_src.c X  cc special_src.c -o special_name X X     or  rm -f special_build   need special build X  tail +4 build > special_build X  sh < special_build X X * Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of X   your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You X   should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges (not the address for X judges@toad.com      submitting entries) X X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X date -u \\\"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\\\" X date -u | sed -e 's/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/' X sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X ---entry--- section X all ---author--- sections X all ---info--- sections X ---build--- section X ---program--- section X any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X * reading the ---entry--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X * passing the source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X * performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X * passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X * linting the source X * compiling/building the source X * running the program X * performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X * best small one line program X * best small program X * strangest/most creative source layout X * most useful obfuscated program X * best game that is obfuscated X * most creatively obfuscated program X * most deceptive C code X * best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X * best abuse of ANSI C X * worst abuse of the rules X * <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X     comp.lang.c    comp.unix.wizards alt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X     comp.sources.d   alt.sources.d  misc.misc X     comp.sources.misc   comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners X    have appeared in books (\\\"The New Hackers Dictionary\\\") and on T-Shirts.

In fact, however, # #the argument is specious, at best.  More recent scholarship from the  # #last 20-30 years demonstrates rather conclusively that the cotton/sugar/ # #tobacco economy and its reliance on slavery was increasingly dominant in  # #the South prior to the Civil War. #  # This is because the South did not receive the massive momentum of capital #  intensive growth that the Northern states did. Compare the Northern #  agricultural system with the Southern and you will see a major difference  #  in the capital to labor intensity.  Capital and labor are one and the same in a slave economy.  Except that capital doesn't reproduce quite as readily as slaves did.  Slavery was a dying institution before the cotton gin, yes, but not in 1850.  # #It is true that cotton suffered from price depression in the 1840's - # #the period used to claim that slavery would not have lasted in the  # #South.   #  # That is not the argument that I have heard. It would not have lasted because #  the growth in the North would not have been sustained for much longer without #  spilling over to the Southern states, i.e. Northern industry would have  #  migrated capital to the Southern states, and with that would have come  #  immigrant labor to the ports of the South, e.g. Charleston, Savannah, Mobile, #  New Orleans, etc. This would have put the breaks on the slave market and #  slavery would have been out-moded by the capital intensity of competing  #  agriculturalists.

This assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments would not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the North.  Since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else to destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery, I do not doubt that they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive threat.  Thomas Sowell's _Market and Minorities_ argues that the maintenance of slavery, and the costs it imposed on state and local governments, discouraged not only capital formation, but also outside capital investment in the Southern states.  #  Craig A.

It is fast moving out of t.a scope, but I didn't know if t.a was the only group of the three that you subscribed to. Apologies to regular t.a folks.    You must be using 'values' to mean something different from the way I see it used normally.  And you are certainly using 'Science' like that if you equate it to \\\"the real world\\\".  Science is the recognition of patterns in our perceptions of the Universe and the making of qualitative and quantitative predictions concerning those perceptions.  It has nothing to do with values as far as I can see. Values are ... well they are what I value. They are what I would have rather than not have - what I would experience rather than not, and so on.  Objective values are a set of values which the proposer believes are applicable to everyone.   I don't agree. Science is useful insofar as it the predictions mentioned above are accurate.  That is insofar as what I think *will be* the effect on my perceptions of a time lapse (with or without my input to the Universe) versus what my perceptions actually turn out to be.  But values are about whether I like (in the loosest sense of the word) the  perceptions :-)   I don't see why. 'Usefulness' in science is synonomous with 'accuracy' - period. Tarot predictions are not useful because they are not accurate - or can't be shown to be accurate. Science is useful because it is apparently accurate.

Cheers Nigel\",\"Is life a pass/fail course, and does God grade on a curve?  I'm new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to know what some of you people think.  Specifically, are there an infinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that he/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?) Also, are we \\\"graded\\\" by those around us, or has there always been some unchanging method?  Is the person's childhood taken into account?  I'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to most of you, but I figure that you're the experts.        -Quinn  [Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect that's because our primary source of information is prophets and visionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However both Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation to John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of similar passages where Jesus says things like \\\"even XXX will be better off than you in the judgement.\\\"  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who gets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens, so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only Christian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the Mormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far enough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their ideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition to the Bible and \\\"Holy Tradition\\\" of a more generic Christian sort.  Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free us from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If you like test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale, but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading. Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to see why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are differences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all agree that in one way or another, God cheats.  I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don't explicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their hearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in principle, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear description of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing line.  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not.\",\"       Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt!! Sorry -- wrong.

The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other    amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid   with massive heat sinks and very solid casing. If you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components    in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect   symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each   channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are   virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.  I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east   or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components   they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the   amplifiers sound so brilliant. I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with   those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly   hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.  My last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like   the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded   like new.  If you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will   sound brilliant and last a long time - period.  Just my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps. \",\" I agree with this assessment.  Furthermore, its promotion as providing greater protection than bare voice is quite true, as far as it goes.  However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal of letting LE wiretap \\\"terrorists and drug dealers\\\" is to restrict stronger techniques.    Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption, weak encryption, or (the vast majority) no encryption.  The latter two classes can be tapped.  With weak encryption in every phone, the no-encryption class is merged into the weak-encryption class.  Will the introduction of Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strong privacy to give up on it?  that is, to rely for privacy on a system expressly designed to deny it to people like them?  I doubt it.  The mere introduction of this scheme will give the government *nothing*.  The stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretapping capabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domestic cryptography, and only by this restriction.  \\\"Clipper\\\" appears to be no more than a sop, given to the public to mute any complaints.  We would find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff, but I fear the public at large will not care.  I hate to even mention gun control, but most people seem to think that an `assault weapon' (as the NYT uses the word) is some sort of automatic weapon, .50 caliber maybe.  Who wants to have such a thing legal?  Well, people know even less about cryptology; I suspect that strong cryptography could easily be labeled \\\"too much secrecy for law-abiding citizens to need\\\".   What they say is opinion, but what they do is what matters, and will continue unless overturned.  And the courts are reluctant to annul law or regulation, going to some length to decide cases on other grounds.  Furthermore, Congress can get away with quite a bit.  They could levy a burdensome tax; this would place enforcement in the hands of the BATF, who as we've seen you really don't want on your case.  They could invoke the Commerce Clause; this seems most likely.  This clause will get you anywhere these days.  The 18th was required because the Supreme Court ruled a prohibitory statute unconstitutional.  In 1970 Congress prohibited many drugs, with a textual nod to the Commerce Clause.  The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 still stands.  I think the government could get away with it. \",\"# # I remember seeing something in the X distribution mentioning support # for a Tektronix terminal in an X server.

Basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling and the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the hot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is rapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently seen rising out of these towers.  That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.  The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference (sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage \\\"hot\\\" turbine to final stage \\\"cold\\\" turbine).

I must congratulate your analytical and excellent reportage about  Diana. From  the writings  of tye biographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe chauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian genes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian, she   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong characteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian ancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian from  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant Thedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady Diana. It is noteworthy  that Eliza Kewark was also referred  to as  Mrs. Forbesian  (a characteristic Armenian  surname  ending).  An  Armenian-Scottish gene mix is dynamite.  Levon K.

Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.   Source: Stanford J.

If he/she does not seem to take any action, keep going up higher and higher. Sexual harrassment does not need to be tolerated, and it can be an enormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that they are trying to do something about it.  If you feel you can not discuss this with your boss, perhaps your company has a personnel department that can work for you while preserving your privacy.  Most companies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety does seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs.  It is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not.  It is not inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee problems/strife even after eight years (it's a miracle if they do notice).  Perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of higher ups?  If the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the entire problem, there may be a state agency willing to fight with you.  (check with a lawyer, a women's resource center, etc to find out)  You may also want to discuss this with your paster, priest, husband, etc.  That is, someone you know will not be judgemental and that is supportive, comforting, etc.  This will bring a lot of healing.   This happens to a lot of people.  Honest.  I believe it may seem to be due to gross insensitivity because of the feelings you are going through.  People in offices tend to be more insensitive while working than they normally are (maybe it's the hustle or stress or...)

A complete lie will rarely be readily accepted, while a half truth (the lie subtly hidden) is more powerfully offered by one who masquerades as an angel of light.  Satan has (for some people) loosened the grip on treating the earth as something other than God's intricate handiwork, something other than that on which the health of future generations is based.  It is being treated with respect.  You think he's going to happily leave it at that?  No.  When one error is rejected, it is his style to push people to the opposite error.  Therefore the earth is not God's intricate handiwork, not because it is rubbish, but because it is God.  Mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve.  I see two facets of a response to it:  1: Care for the environment.  Treat it with proper respect, both because it is    God's intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because    showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not    constitute what the Apostle Paul called \\\"becoming all things to all men so    that by all possible means I might save some.\\\"     Don't say \\\"Forget the environment, I've got important things to spend my time    on.\\\" - putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your    credibility in expressing the things that _are_ more important.  2: Show that it is not the ultimate entity, that it is creature and not    creator.

Thanks. \",\" Gawd, I love Windows :-)   You'll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them fresh.  Data files should be examined and repaired.   You're not stupid.  Smartdrive caches things, and Windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also.  All of this is pretty risky stuff in a PC environment.   A reasonably accurate prediction...   Here's a brief description of how DOS stores files:  There are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain, and the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.  The directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size, and first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not important right now.  The File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find the actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the number is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it holds a \\\"magic\\\" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad (unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file.  The data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored. The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is doled out in \\\"chunks\\\" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster is 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.  To read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster. Next, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file. Naturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump around and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a time, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker which says it's the last cluster in the file.  CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into submission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to double-check anything it \\\"fixes\\\".  Now let's do a bit of a post-mortem:   All of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match the size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter the directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the directory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long. But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers, obviously, are made up.))   Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached to any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these \\\"lost chains\\\" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK through FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply be marked \\\"available\\\" in the FAT.    ...   These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously, one of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that C:\\\\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...  To fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name. This will \\\"fix\\\" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces. Now delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to assemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  \\\"Missing pieces\\\" are likely to be found in those \\\"lost chains\\\" at the top...)   Your disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of the problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space...  In any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT. There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage after something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the problem occurs.

Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last point.  Why don't you take a poll, Fred, if you want some psuedo-objective point-of-view?  And, as usual, you defend your insults with \\\"he started it.\\\"  \\\"Yeah, I took some of his research and called it my own, but he started it.\\\"  \\\"So what if I stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first.\\\"  Besides that, I think it's still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it. So your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway.  Your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool:  \\\"I never borrowed it, I already gave it back, and it was broken when you gave it to me.\\\"  Make up yer mind, Fred!      First, I try to address what I think you meant, for which I am rewarded with a denial of sorts, and a smart remark.  Then, I point out that I am not clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wrongly interpreting you a second time, and I'm stupid for it.  I just can't win, can I, Fred?

Instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had.

The federal government has an interest in the intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations of civil rights. It's the way they broke the back of the Klan, by putting a lot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically. It is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid since over 100 years ago. It has been used whenever a select group was getting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being part of a minority. It is the only way we made the defeat of the south stick after the Civil War. People who harrassed free blacks, when normally they wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were expeditiously tried and jailed for 5 to 8 years until nobody wanted to try it anymore. Now with the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law, the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent as much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to somebody. They can call out the national guard just for them, as they did the school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 1950's, and the president can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of the militia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at the thousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obey or face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms!

This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a \\\"verbatim  translation\\\" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place -- the book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section by section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating. In the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce  the German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not  surprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a  single idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi law; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into,  urban-folklore style.  2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a  copy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution  team or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't  understand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable  to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and  yet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:  \\\"If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons Law during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of documents, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German law registry].\\\"  Bingo.  Exactly.    Dodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one under discussion.  All of the stuff about \\\"Why would a U.S. congressman have a copy of a Nazi law?\\\" melts away, by the author's admission.  He then continues:  \\\"But if he acquired the original German text of the  Nazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so  for a very specific reason...\\\"  But there's absolutely no reason to  think that this is the case.  In fact, as a \\\"senior member of the U.S.  team that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals\\\", it seems to me that he would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether  the Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously is, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally prosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red  herrings.  3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the JPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he  asked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge  levelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask  to have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd  took it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing  it into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*,  wouldn't he?     Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier posting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this purpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent on disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil liberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it on their own?     Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his own question: \\\"Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law to show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the  Nazi law.\\\"  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered into the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents \\\"concerning the history of Nazism and gun confiscation\\\", Dodd's motivation isn't a  mystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.  4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that was added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.   Registration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT a \\\"Nazi-inspired\\\" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the  1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification  of certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list  other parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews; of course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless, in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the  discussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues,  \\\"Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68...\\\" -- so  as to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.\",\" And that, of course, is the point.   You can't simply divide the world into atheists and non-atheists on the basis of god-belief.  If all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity, and have nothing to say about behaviour, then belief in a supernatural being is your criterion.  But once you start talking about behaviour, then someone's suscept- ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you  are - I assume - worried about.  And in that area, what you care about is whether someone is sceptical, critical and autonomous on the one hand, or gullible, excitable and easily led on the other.  I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates that a person is easily led.   Whether they have a worship or belief  in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be beside the point.\",\"has no mitigate literature,  First, let me offer you my condolences.  I've had kidney stones 4 times  and I know the pain she is going through.  First, it is best that she see  a doctor.  However, every time I had kidney stones, I saw my doctor and the only thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for a urinary tract infection.  The pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stones are extremely painful.  My stones were judged passable, so we just waited it out.  However the last one took 10 days to pass...not fun.  Anyway, if she absolutely won't see a doctor, I suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhaps an over the counter sleeping pill.  But, I do highly suggest seeing a doctor. Kidney stones are not something to fool around with.  She should be x-rayed  to make sure there is not a serious problem.\",\"I have a BACK MACHINE and have had one since January.

I would never say that anybody that critizises Israel   and/or its politics is an antisemite, except he uses antisemitic   vocabulary/terminology/demagogy. Israel is not a perfect country and   its politicians also commits errors, even some of them are corrupt   (like politicians in any other country), but they carry a huge burden:   to care for the safety of ALL its citizens, and that is really not an   easy task in a country that is surrounded by enemies who only expect   that Israel commits the ONE BIG ERROR and wipe the country (and its   Jewish citizens plus the so-called collaborators, arabs that wanted to   live in peace with their Jewish neighbours) of the map. As I said,   Israel is not a perfect country, but it is the ONLY democracy in the   whole Middle-East and the only country in the world where Jews from   everywhere can have a refuge in case of persecutions in the countries   they are living.   Our long history has taught us that we cannot rely on non-Jewish   nations and its governments: as soon as there are more or les big   social-economical-political problems in any country, the first ones   that pay for the broken glasses are the Jews, and later the other   minorities of the country.                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     This is really outrageous: 6.000.000 murdered Jews, besides the   thousands  who survived the Shoa in some way or another, and the rest   of the living ones mourning for all of them !

I guess for DOS users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to  be able to use more than 64K of memory, its a major improvement. For Windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for  granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running  3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even  a real issue. My ideal operating system:   Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize  binaries and configure on the fly, so I don't have to have  bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc...   Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac   and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which   has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in   80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips.  Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems.   Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton   or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform   or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly.  so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on    my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential.   Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS  or NT or OS/2, and run shell scripts or command/BAT files.   Object oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have  to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch  or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly.

In April  1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A  number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German officials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian Paikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku. Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the creation of an Armenian SS formation in order   \\\"to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the   spirit of the Nazi ideas.\\\"  He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish homeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language radio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]  [1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106.

The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored by General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any  official position. His views were represented by his men in the respective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942. Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after a long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to Berlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1]   A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not 'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy. As such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians were the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August  1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.  [1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., pp. 112-113.  Need I go on?

It is available for $169 mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.  I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400 dpi) and price ($149).    Basically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the best buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?

PHILIP K. DICK  Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short  stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable. He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:  \\\"Galactic Pot-Healer\\\" A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.  \\\"A Maze of Death\\\" Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.  \\\"VALIS\\\" The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.  \\\"The Divine Invasion\\\" God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.  MARGARET ATWOOD  \\\"The Handmaid's Tale\\\" A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it \\\"right\\\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked, and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \\\"old world\\\" are hunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.

RICHARD SWINBURNE  \\\"The Existence of God (Revised Edition)\\\", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with \\\"The Coherence of Theism\\\" (1977) and was concluded with \\\"Faith and Reason\\\" (1981).  In this work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were decisively rejected in Mackie's \\\"The Miracle of Theism\\\".  In the revised edition of \\\"The Existence of God\\\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.  J. L. MACKIE  \\\"The Miracle of Theism\\\", Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational, such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \\\"replacements for God\\\" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.  JAMES A.

The story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to get the safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has  aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.  The inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a waiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book and said \\\"It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now.\\\" Well, won't argue with that...  Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the tint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the library).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't get in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.  So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer? I called the station  later on today, but they basically said there is no place where I could register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?  Any comments about it will be welcome!\",\"     What I like about GUI's:   - The ability to view and manipulate a group of objects, files,    text, directories, etc. and and manipulate them in some way    such as delete, copy, paste, rename ...   - The ability to have several applications / screens visible    and accessable at the same time.   - Being able to do a standard set of functions easily and    quickly on an unfamiliar operating system. I am familiar with    the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally    I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use.    If it has a GUI, I can usually accomplish what I want to do    fairly easily, the command line on the other hand often is    a long and painful experience.   What I hate about GUI's:   - Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess    I have a strong one-handed preference. I like to use a    computer with one hand and use the other for holding something    like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. I have configured my    favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be    done with one hand such as navigating, cutting, pasting,    searching, opening and saving files, etc. The main thing I    need to use both hands for is entering text.

In addition, the [KK]        Israeli embassy in Washington was active in ensuring that the [KK]        resolution failed, for instance by assisting Turkish Jews to [KK]        travel to Wahington to underline the affinity between Israel [KK]        and Turkey. [KK] [KK]        There was no doubt about the debt which Turkey felt it owed [KK]        to Israel over this matter. Even four months before the re- [KK]        solution came up for consideration, as enior member of the [KK]        Turkish Foreign Ministry said his country was \\\"very grateful\\\" [KK]        to Israel, the cooperation, in his view, refelecting the  [KK]        maturity of the bilateral relationship. The experience over [KK]        the Armenian issue has convinced senior figures in Turkey [KK]        that the pro-Israel network in Washington can indeed deliver [KK]        the desired results.

You have a rather warped sense of logic! You are telling us that because Israel wishes to have good relations with Turkey even at the expense of Armenians or Armenia, makes it bad for Turks to tell racist jokes against  Jews. Thus, we can infer, if Israel had poor relations with Turkey, it would be alright to post such horrible jokes against Jews!   You impress nobody.  \",\"  Perhaps you should try nic.funet.fi instead of funet.fi ??!?!? nic.funet.fi is THE biggest (?) ftp site from Europe, but the stuff available there should (?) also be available at the other site of the \\\"big pool\\\".\",\" Tell me Tim, what are these guerillas doing wrong? Assuming that they are using civilians for cover, are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country? If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel, is it not working? Why is it  further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages? Why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone? You see, there is more to the shelling of the villages.... it is called RETALIATION... \\\"GETTING BACK\\\" ...\\\"GETTING EVEN\\\". It doesn't make sense to shell the villages. The least it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli government for the lives of civilians.     If Israel is not willing to accept the \\\"word\\\" of others then, IMHO, it has no business wasting others' time coming to the peace talks.    No, I am not Basil. I think Basil is a very intelligent person and I respect what he writes. Basil is a person that I would gladly call a friend. He is, however, not me. Nor am I Lebanese, as some seem to suspect.    Tim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been disarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah does not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up Sheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. Of course, if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't make the Lebanese so mad as to do that. Furthermore, with Hezbollah  subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.   Tim, when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border? Not lately, eh?  Israel knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would use territory under their control to attack Israel. While Lebanon would be better off with Syria and Israel out of its borders, the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on Israeli territory (not on Israeli troops in Lebanon, however. Please note the distinction) in the past two years.   I disagree, Basil has always seemed to me to be a cool-headed person, slow to anger (certainly more so than I). What is most important is that he is an  actual witness to things from the other end of the Israeli guns. If only the  Israeli government would remember what it was like when the roles were  reversed perhaps they would moderate their \\\"retaliation\\\".\",\" **************************************************************** *    //////                                ---------------------- *   //   //  \\\"Electronic Networking For   /   PsychNet.Com      / *  //////    \\\"Professional Psychology.\\\"  /Serving Psychologists/ * // sychNet     (1-800-541-2598)       /  World Wide         / *//                                    ----------------------- ************************************************************   It's an experiment, place a not so subliminal, slightly cagey message in front of a viewer and see how long it takes to create a response, and what was the response...

During the second  Imlach era, when Darryl Sittler was called a \\\"cancer on the team\\\", he tore the C off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain.  Sittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly captaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittler's friend) Bobby Clarke.  Instead, Sittler got traded to Detroit.  Rick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and they took the captaincy away from him.  Then he was traded to Chicago.  During Doug Carpenter's tenure as Leaf coach, in an  attempt  to  kiss the  ass of a sulking Gary Leeman, the Leafs took the A away from Brad Marsh to give to Leeman.  Leeman wouldn't take it and when they  tried to give it back to Marsh, he wouldn't take it neither.  The best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman, late of the Senators.  While he was in Philadelphia, Bobby Clarke, arguably one of the great captains of all time, was bumped up to the status  of playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy.  Bridgman be- came the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a captain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the players.  The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of  making sure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full.   -- \",\"From article <1qkkl5INNbvo@hp-col.col.hp.com>, by theckel@col.hp.com (Tim Heckel):  --When I was selling Nissans last summer, I sold a '92 SE-R in early August   when its supply was getting quite scarce.

Some software others hardware orientated.. (Probably the wrong newsgroup .... as everyone  claims..)  Anyway..  1) Does any one happen to have the board jumper details for a Trident 8900 SVGA graphics card (1MB) or even what the dip switches do on the end.. Mine already works fine (albeit slow) and after having blown up a monitor I found  out which switch controlled the interlace/non interlace facility..   But I'm curious as to why there are 8 dip switches on the card with apparantly little use..  2) Secondly, does anyone know why Commodore had to be so crazed in their design of the PC-40 motherboard with respect to the RAM.. (IE 512 + 512 or 640 +0K) ??  3) Can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc (8 or 16 bit ) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed... (Yeah I know its a piece of cake.. I'm lazy 8)  4) Software wise.. Anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded RAM on a PC (from a program written in Turbo C++)....   For instance, using farcoreleft() and coreleft() return only memory available from the base 640K regardless of combinations of EMM386 etc etc... What I want is to be able to use the RAM above and beyond the 1MB boundary...  I'm not certain whether farmalloc / new actually uses it anyway but I'll  suspect not ..   5) Also.. what half brained wit created DOS so as not to be re-entrant??????    As a follow on, does anyone have any comments about the use of DOS calls    0 to 0C from within a DOS interrupt? Ie will changing the stack size on    entry be of use.. Two articles I've read on the subject have given     conflicting views... Does anyone have any views on writing direct to    screen memory in terms of portability?\",\"    Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions. However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the center.  (These measurements are statistical, and you can always hide a sufficiently small number of a different type of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming that there is only one population of GRBs).  The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center of the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets way beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing GRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to be released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.  If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy) you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of the Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center (for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if they are Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in radius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, the Earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.   The aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don't see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.   There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature. Right now, the theorists have a sort of unofficial moratorium on new models until new observational evidence comes in. \",\"TSN Sportsdesk just reported that the OTTAWA SUN has reported that Montreal will send 4 players + $15 million including Vin Damphousse  and Brian Bellows to Phillidelphia, Phillie will send Eric Lindros to Ottawa, and Ottawa will give it's first round pick to Montreal.   If this is true, it will most likely depend on whether or not Ottawa gets to choose 1st overall.  Can Ottawa afford Lindros' salary?   Personally, I can't see Philli giving up Lindros -- for anything.   They didn't give away that much to Quebec just to trade him away  again.  Not to mention that Lindros seems to be a *huge* draw in Phillie -- and that he represents a successful future for the  franchise.

Where the session key is K, and is transmitted encrypted in the unit Key U. Which along with the serial number N is encrypted in the Family key F.  Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The function of this spoof chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the family key   2) Receive Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming integrity of the      law enforcement block is necessary for local operation -      checksums, sequence control, etc.).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  It is probable theere is a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N (34 bits as used in generating U, U1,U2) correctness of the law enforcement block can be determined with only the family key F.  Whereas, no one has proposed Federal Agencies be denied F, and because they could recover it themselves, The correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits of N in E[N; F].  The one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above, but the mutilation could be detected.  A better approach would be to mutilate the entire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption scheme such as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement block can be recovered are lessened.  What do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the serial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmission becomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocol transmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?  One way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the block containing M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.  The goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to  detection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the law enforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original state for use by the clipper chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.  It is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within the clipper chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for, requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting and decrypting E(M; K);  The spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, including on the resulting serial data stream.  Existing clipper products could be subborned.  After all, they are high security encryption systems right?  Super encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without redress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serial number.  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number, which should not be recoverable by other means.  One can see the use of cut outs for procurring clipper phones, or once the number of units is high enough, stealing them.  It would be a mistake on the part of authority, but nice from a point of privacy, if the serial number N were not associated with a particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and  distribution process.  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolen clipper serial numbers N encrypted with F, and the protocols are not  sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream. This could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted stream.  Detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned scheme.  ******************************************************************************  If you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own, and use them in a codebook sustitution with your own, where they point to a valid law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching the remainder of the transmission, you could simply out and out lie, yet deliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement block.   These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators, such as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would require escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.  The M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream and the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key generator synchronized between endpoints.  The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission interception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there's supposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps to the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants an encryption chip with a real time clock?  *****************************************************************************\",\"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----        >So, don't just think of replacements for clipper, also think of front    >ends.

The moral lesson of the story is:  The Lamb of God has been sacrificed and His blood has  been used to cleanse us of our sins every moment as God perceives worthy of being done in Heaven.  Mary weeps for The Lamb and for the rest of her offsprings.  This will continue while we  disobey God or sin against Him.  Mary, as a messenger,  has been given the task to make us be 'aware' of the evil serpent (communism, wars, famine, unfaithful, disobedience to God, etc.) running after the rest of her offsprings.    The children who went astray by disobedience led by the dragon is  brought back by her peace and loving messages, reparations for sins,  to obey God's commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence  of The Lamb.  As she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing the Son of God in her womb, Mary has been preparing us, the Church, the Body of Christ, for His second coming (making sure we are  protected from the dragon).  Also, she has been preparing the new  Eden, by reversing the deed of the ancient Eve.  The new Eden will be the sanctuary of the righteous as judged by Christ in His next coming.      I relate the story again:     I believe this and Mary, in one of her apparitions       in 19th or 20th century, she appeared to these           two children who tends goats and cows (I forgot          the exact place).  She was  weeping and telling the      children that she is afraid she's \\\"going to lose her     Son's arm\\\".  She is mourning too for these               townfolks because it was their fault that there          would be drought in their harvest; not much good         food again this year as it was last year.                                                                         Mary tells the children:                             *    Most of the townfolks in this place worked whole    * *    week even on Sundays when they should be in church  * *    honoring God.  These townfolks swears and           * *    uses her Son's name in bad words.  That is          *     why her Son's arm is so heavy in pain.                   Then she asked them if they pray.  The children          said \\\"hardly\\\".  She asked them to pray every             morning and night.  When the children went back          from work they had to tell somebody about this.          When the news was spred and after thorough           *    investigation of the incident, the townfolks        * *    were converted and faith and obedience to God       * *    were restored in their community.                   *   Once again, the Lamb succeeds.\",\" # 3.

Firstly, what do you exactly mean by \\\"fundamentalist\\\"?  I will for the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes that the bible is God's word to mankind?  I suspect that what happened to him is what he'll call being \\\"born again\\\"?  Anyway, was that recent? If the answer is \\\"yes\\\" to all the questions above, it is quite understandable.  However, IMO, I'ld rather give advice to your friend! I think I've been through something similar to him, and one thing I can say is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to communicate from different worldviews.  Why he talks about those things is because they are now \\\"obvious\\\" to him.  What is \\\"obvious\\\" to him is not obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because from his point of view, he has been on \\\"both sides of the fence\\\".  This I mean that before he turned \\\"fundamentalist\\\", you two are agreeable because both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as if a new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the discovery of let's say a new continent, or a new planet.  To him, he's got to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than where he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now. You have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to you, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth that risk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand and listen to you as well.  At this moment, it may be difficult because he is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about, however, he may not realise that he's really putting you off.  [...]   So far, I've only been trying to explain things from his side.  However, I do understand how you feel too, because I wasn't a Christian for a good part of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or \\\"fundamentalists\\\" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their faith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately, \\\"religious belief\\\" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism is also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is inevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise), it will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take both sides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you can do your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he's trying to convince you about, that it's beyond you or not your concern \\\"for now\\\".  Don't tell him it's nonsense, because to him it is reality - and that would be a real insult.  He'll also have to be careful not to insult where you stand too.  Like I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too. I'll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a Christian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little differently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited and just blabbered away about what I've found!  To me, it was too good not to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didn't really care most of the time what they thought.  You will probably think he's crazy too - but God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in mind.  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real to him, he doesn't see why God can't be real to you too.  I don't know how helpful this is to you.  But all the best anyhow - this is quite a challenge for you to face.

A little-known fact is that the Chevrolet Co. actually took over GM! That was how Durant got back in charge of GM-- legally his new company Chevrolet Co. did the buying, and GM was a division of Chevrolet!  After 1920 and into the Sloan era, GM shuffled things so that the GM board was superior, but there was always a degree of autonomy given the Chevy division, presumably because of the initial structure. (If you look at the organization chart for GM in Sloan's book, Chevy division reports directly to 14th floor, not through the \\\"passenger car division\\\" which covers Buick, Olds, Cadillac, and Oakland/Pontiac)\",\"I've just managed to get xdm running from an NCR 3000 (an SVR4 486 box running XFree86 1.2) to my NCD XDisplay.

If you want to know about events in Palestine it makes more sense to get the news directly from the source.

However,  the more sources relied upon the easier it is to see the \\\"truth\\\" and to discern  the bias.   Go read or listen to some Israeli media. You will learn more news and more opinion about Israel and Palestine by doing so.

He is only insurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcher is injured during a game.     So to free up this roster spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever, why not invoke a catcher re-substitution rule:  If the last roster catcher on a team is injured during a game, the team is permitted to substitute in his place for defensive purposes a catcher who has previously been yanked from the game.     Given this rule, a team wouldn't need 3 roster catchers.

My program stores the points of a polygon in CCW order.  I've used 3D Concepts a  little and it seems that the points are stored in the order they are drawn.  Does the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the  points are stored in, CW or CCW?  Its easy enough to convert, but if I don't know which way they are stored, I dont know  which direction the polygon should be visible from.  If DXF doesn't handle this, can anyone recommend a workaround? The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one in the DXF file, one stored CW and the other CCW.  But that doubles the number of polygons and decreases speed...  Thanks in advance for any help,\",\"  I was there in 1976.  I suppose it must have died out since 1946, then.

But how do you propose we take government back?  They obviously don't listen to the people or want the people to know who is responsibile for what (a person telnetted the site of the Clipper chip release, to see what the entity 'clipper' was, and got a few lists. BUt when another person tried a bit later, the commands were disabled) Does not sound like an Administration that wants to have any accountability or information they don't control given to the people.  The secret development and implimentation of the Clipper Chip decision further backs that up.  You can bet unaurhorized encryption methods and software will be considered 'terrorist tools' and also subject to civil forfeiture, along with the systems that are running it.  YOU WATCH, SEE IF I AM WRONG.  The government is not going to be very cooperative about the people taking it back.  And they have all the resources, unlimited access to the media for propeganda, and almost all the guns (soon to be ALL the guns if Clinton's agenda succeeds)...   Those that do not play ball?  Waco might be a good example of what to expect...  The warrant (just released) stated the reason for the raid was the BDs spent a very large sum for weapons, over an undetermined amount of time.  I don't recall spending a lot of money on guns, etc being illegal ... yet, that is.  Clinton might go down in history as the worst thing to ever happen to the US of A. ... Now to be known as the 'Peoples Socalist Democratic Republic of America'  (PSDRA).  Big Brother is LISTENING!!!  Hail Big Brother...

EDT               THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that  Octavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today  about why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to  get a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature  of learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of  people like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of  those who are here.                I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education  and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my  good friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and  all of the business and local community leaders from the city and  county and state level from around America who are here.               This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved  hearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is  their future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A  year and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because  I was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our  country, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had  too little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines  of income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to  take us into the future.                I entered with the hope that together we could create  more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of  our people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of  America's community, knowing that together we could always to more  than we could individually and that we might secure our future.              All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000  jobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the  commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here,  and those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs  does, and the successes of all the young people like those on this  stage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all  those things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're  on the right track.              Last July when I was traveling across America's  heartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in  Louisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business  people who were participating in the Louisville Education and  Employment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.   I saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed  both in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my  own state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about  -- that for millions of American young people it is really an  impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good  workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what  is learning.              In the world in which we are living, the average young  person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a  lifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning  world much better.  And we must determine that all of our young  people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased  here today.                Whether you're in business or in government or in  education, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to  building a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all  of our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things  are pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best  thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have  jobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)                They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty  good education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that  they'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either  political or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great  challenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to  fully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work  for them to do.              All the European countries have higher unemployment  rates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the  unemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.   They're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its  most rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that  I have proposed to create jobs.               In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now  about as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.   It costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of  pressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing  their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their  people.                But it is especially important for America for two  reasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move  aggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be  competitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is,  even if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed  of the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to  work in this country.  (Applause.)              We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some  of it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and  moving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We  have now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big  organizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they  are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working  at some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to  create jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the  chance to work.                It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare  reform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of  months -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the  end of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.   (Applause.)              So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of  the American people to perform without regard to race or income or  the circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that  there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their  talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.   I do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if  you want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more  responsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this  country that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you  have got to have opportunity in that mix.               A part of our vision for America has to be a future for  every young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules  and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be  something at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are  basically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners,  recognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of  our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their  background.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's  something there for them to do?        The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an  integral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of  work and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people  first, and it does have a partnership between the public and private  sector.              I said when I addressed the United States Congress in  February on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000  extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the  American business community to meet that target so that we can create   more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been  created before.              Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And  Jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in  this room and around the country -- people who are going to do more  than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people  a work experience.  And it is terribly important.              I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is  part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the  American people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their  jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving  the transition from school to work for young people who don't go to  college but do need at least two years of post-high school training  either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting,  so that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more  people to go on to college who do want to go.              All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive  plan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The  emergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would  create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and  that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It  would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work  force in jobs that otherwise will not be created.               It also will help a lot of cities and counties to  invest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level -- projects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects,  new industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities  -- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve  the environment.                The summer jobs program is an important part of that  because we have tried for the first time, through the work of the  Labor Department and the Education Department and through reaching  out to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer  jobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to  hopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young  people into further educational opportunities and to further job  opportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component  to these summer jobs -- something that the United States government  has never fully emphasized before.                A lot of these young people, as you well know, because  they come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in  difficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building  their basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other  areas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who  have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what  they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next  year.                What we are trying to do here is to give people the  opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning  skills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next  couple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school  in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning  environment.                There will be more applied academics, more opportunities  for people to learn and work during the school year, so that this  will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will  be a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new  work experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.              The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make- work jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding  the job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help  to build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve  local problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public  buildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in  hospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers,  and learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while  they earn, but letting them earn.              You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people  who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should  do this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the  opportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing  in going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't  exactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare  system; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people  to work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the  use of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if  you're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to  reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.   (Applause.)              The young people we propose to put to work under our  program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math,  reading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will  stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a  sense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge,  but a challenge that will take them into a different life.              So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even  as I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the  summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll  see whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer  academically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved  ahead.  I suspect that they will.                This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I  will be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn  from you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next  summer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school  year, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that  we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so  that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private  investments as well.               We want to honor the companies and the communities, the  business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this  summer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business  who have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who  haven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about  this event today, I want to implore other private employers to  stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this  summer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when  we don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort  them to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)              When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up  here on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking  about work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've  done to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very  foolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand  and sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had  ever had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be  worth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)              That does not mean young people should not be  entrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation  ahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and  worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.   And I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some  people say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)                I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I  grew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul  without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a  job.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to  people is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a  job and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now  I live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any  more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're  working longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.   And we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these  young people want.              Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:   It doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration  pursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private  sector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn  how to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created  in this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done  off-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a  third or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do  economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of  America's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just  kidding.                On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy  country in the world, including the United States, is having  difficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done  I'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole  deliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the  answers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.   (Applause.)              And so the jobs program that I have presented to  Congress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the  counties, through the Community Development Program, with the  infrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an  attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the  economy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little  boost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a  million jobs and maybe get the engine going again.              Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in  the private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government  money.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American  economy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind  of system we have and it works pretty well.                But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you  here today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends  and neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers  to make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the  funds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government  should create this summer, so that together we can have this  partnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a  future -- a future that our young people can believe in.                We need to send them a message that here in America if  you study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute  something to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.   You can build a future from you own dreams.               That has always been the promise of America.  Together  that's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of  the promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise  has been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.              Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\",\"1st round:  ----------  PITT vs NYI:  PITT in 4.   It looks like a safe bet.  NYI has been bagging it of late.

It seems to me that Pigsburg has some egos on their team.  Their saving grace though is Bowman.  He can put anybody in their place. However, if PIGS have a quick first round, they may be a little too high.  WASH could be there for a surprise.  Having said that, I will say PITT in 6.  BOS  vs MON:  BOS  in 6. MON will not be there.  BOS is surprising me of late. Cam is great. The couple of wins against QUE last week have sold me with the B's.  B's in 6.   CHI  vs DET:  CHI  in 7. Yikes.  This will not be pretty.  But DET is running like a machine of late.  They've had a non-busy end of the season in which they played like killers.  DET in 6.  WIN  vs CAL:  CAL  in 5. CAL has a solid team, a little weak in the nets.  CAL will out muscle WIN.  CAL in 5.  3rd round:  ----------  PITT vs BOS:  PITT in 5.   I hate PITT.  My logic eludes me.  The dark side will take over and give BOS the extra push it needs to dump PITT.  There may be something to this - if you think of the rivalry.  BOS in 7. CHI  vs CAL:  CHI  in 5.   Finals: ------  PITT vs CHI: PITT in 5.   NO, no, no.  We have BOS vs DET.  I don't know what to say here.  Both teams will be flying and overdue.

For a review, refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 and June 1919.  Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War, and was unclassified after the war. Supposedly, the government rethought this soon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.  The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of their signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore, the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.  IF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of the man who INVENTED wireless: Tesla.

First let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the Clipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:  The chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs general encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB ECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm consists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data seems to be 64 Bit? Yes. So if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when  Clipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key.  (Or is it one key per direction ?) They can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however. Somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip which is now ready to work. The clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits. These 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number with 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip) At beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??) before sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper chip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number, and the session key. This might look like X{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number} where X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key. This family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???) After that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet being encrypted and decrypted by Clipper.  Denning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160 Bit's.  Now, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not being an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in this scheme, which might be exploited by several parties.  As far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the  obvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing the serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can't imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources for the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money.  Then, the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security could (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits each, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let's simply assume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or law enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrows and l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on and so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding chip is compromised forever. Not very clever, IMHO [ :-)) ]. How about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that the police (or whoever) want's to listen to? Escrows could then simply decode this session-key and send it back to police. (And would naturally not do this after the warrant has expired...) This would be a better technical solution, but I guess politics will not work that way.  Apparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes of intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter- cept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes the right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over there, I have no idea who is allowed to tap, and who not) This certainly means that watched communi- cations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company to the FBI, if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this means as far as I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching- company, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-key will not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable by anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis!  What do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ECB mode, and the first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the session key would not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. Shouldn't be so difficult to do *that* :^)  And now a last point, for the other side. After all I have read and heard about Clipper (not the programming language for dBase, is it ? [:-)]) it seems to have many advantages, which shold not be overseen!

You have a few problems here. Official history says that  the first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi  party, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red herring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of  the histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using  homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that Hitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse official history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts right. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in a coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of homosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it is possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubt it - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his former right hand man was a homosexual?).   Anyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references  to the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the  night of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even  the Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case,  this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the  1920's.   Ah, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the paranoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with  homosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know  what tainted \\\"evidence\\\" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made  by persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those  accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the  1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in  time and plant \\\"tainted\\\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers  which were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being  obvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter do you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in  these matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a  false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point  here seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof  falls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework  before making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.   This is just about the *only* thing we agree on.   I suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and  his SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this must be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what lies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If  you really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them  and ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from  their footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and tracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my specialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my time trying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.   Given that you already consider all evidence \\\"tainted\\\", what on earth would constitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been considered \\\"shrewd guesses\\\"?  I suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) - historians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious  footnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually  provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place  to start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.  I'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My apologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent. I forget which gods are responsible for keeping strings within appropriate newsgroup subject boundaries...\",\"This subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory.  Those who subscribe to _Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone complained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but the contrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads is extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the famous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion. The letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that Nefertiti was \\\"a beautiful black queen.\\\"  This set off an exchange of hotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had an article from an Egyptologist titled \\\"Was Cleopatra Black?\\\"  (The answer to the title is \\\"no\\\"-- she was greek.)  I have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  I personally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine in Wash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations vary enourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark hair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up and down the Mediterranean.  (Also, if what I remember is correct, the \\\"Black Madonna\\\" doesn't represent a person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  Joe Buehler....?)  In the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget that greeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus, the situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians, or various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How about the Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And then there are the Ethiopians....  Those of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these people are \\\"white\\\" (i.e., of the racist's \\\"race\\\").  If I may risk a potentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be the identification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Considering the extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval antisemitism on the other, I don't think that this \\\"Jesus was white\\\" thesis ever played the roles that some hold it did.  Representations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.  It seems awfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to one's own racial group.\",\" I AGREE, LUMBERJACK (except that they're in 2nd)!

One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader. \\\"What could be better,\\\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging?      \\\"It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,\\\" announced Ryne Sandberg.  \\\"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to win.      \\\"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\\\"      The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.      Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center.  \\\"Cool Papa\\\" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone grounded out to second, ending the threat.        \\\"Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\\\"  So came the analysis from Frank Chance.      The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs, Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense. He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.      Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph.      Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st      Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday. The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of first in this wacky season.      Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2 Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday. The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3-2.  \\\"We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed,\\\" remarked Lou Brock.  \\\"I don't see why we can't win this division.\\\"      The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first. -------------------------------------------------------------------      New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs, now 2 back - but in 4th!     \\\"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a pitcher's park like this,\\\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith Hernandez added that \\\"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year, and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\\\"  The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.      Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the .500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins, and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go. ------------------------------------------------------------------      San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5):      Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw, \\\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\\\"      Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13. Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the National League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace. They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.      In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score. The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely. -------------------------------------------------------------------      San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the trade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.      Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after 10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home, and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):      Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \\\"Normally,\\\" Drysdale remarked, \\\"I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't Davis will get decked once.\\\"      The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away, with center field at 420 feet.  \\\"It's as if some three-year-old threw a tantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit home runs',\\\" remarked Roy Campanella.      The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway, Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings, according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the Astros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent. Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.      \\\"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\\\" he explained.      \\\"How can we do that,\\\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.      \\\"They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time.\\\"      The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.      \\\"We're mostly a power team,\\\" remarked Ron Cey.  \\\"Jackie and, when he plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other plays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I guess that's why they're so successful there.\\\"  Indeed, it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.

As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye  stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population  there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately,  the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass  graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed  what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.  The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of  oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot  officials and their violation of the co-founder status of  the Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat  engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution  to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked  Turkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and  only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues  consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories  to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply  was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at  all. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which  was openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece.  Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish  population, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder of the republic with the Greek population.  The Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-minded Greeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with a minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their  autonomy in a separate republic.  Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would rather not be involved with the island. But, given the dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish population in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate of the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots of their rights, liberties and their very lives.

[Quotations omitted.  This is in response to a question about the Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification up to our Catholic readers.  --clh]  There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the mention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the \\\"Annunciation\\\" by Angel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28   And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto  a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a  man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's  name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\\\"Hail,  thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed  art thou among women.\\\"_  Now, now, hold that line of thought - \\\"the Lord is with Mary & blessed art thou among women\\\" - while you read on....  In the book, \\\"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of Devotion to Mary\\\" by Peter Lappin:  The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible that the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title \\\"The Conception of Saint Anne\\\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter, just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary is the incorruptible timber \\\"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of Christ's sinless body\\\"; she is \\\"God's Eden, in whom there is no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\\\"  Her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her purity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus, she was hailed as \\\"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate, spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\\\". ... At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan, John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a  greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_. ...  Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin. From \\\"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\\\" by John A. Hardon:  Baptism - Concupiscence Remains after Baptism. Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of Christ Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).  Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall: In the light of the foregoing, we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over: -They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the  power to think and to choose freely. -The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality  and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires. -They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,  the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding  title to enter heaven. By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely.  Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's sin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day...  Going back to _Immaculate Conception_ (I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):  Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born  AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but STILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was: \\\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou amongst women\\\".  Even Mary was confused about this greeting.  Mary could very well have possessed all of the _treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents (Adam and Eve before their sin):     Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)     Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)     The Lord is with you (At those times, God would                 definitely want to be with those He                 has made _blessed_)     Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)  At the conception, God made Mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body of Christ and so,  Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still has maintained her Immaculate Heart. \",\"I have a Tektronix T921 15Mhz scope for sale.

So far I've also seen this behavior on NCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs.

God's laws were originally written for  : the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to : all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of : Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made : obsolete by Jesus.  Just for reference, here's the earlier quote: Malcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9 and Deuteronomy 22:20-25: : These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had : expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a : direct witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God : is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately : punishable. : Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to : God's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in : the age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There : is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And : not just for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew : and Gentile alike.  These are two conflicting statements.  To say one is a clarification of the other is a breach of logic.  I don't mind people shifting their position on an issue.  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change was made.  What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25?  Is it wrong now?  Did Jesus change that?  : If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the : following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon : the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  Sure he does this.  However, he doesn't address the notion of stoning non-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification.  Are you going to deny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?  : I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of : modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe : in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?  I'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible from end to end and don't believe in it.  Depending on how they use this knowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, and back it up with selected parts of the Bible.  Such Pharisees include David Koresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify this by saying *I don't know* if they actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainly made the means look frightening.  However, just as scary are those that don't know much of the Bible, but believe every word.  In fact, this is probably scarier, since there are far more of these people, from what I've seen.  In addition, they are very easy to manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees, since they don't know enough to debate with these people.  : Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's : perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.  No, it demands obedience to a book.  If God came down and personally told me how I should behave, then I would say that I would be doing God's will by doing it.  However, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me to obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to two millenia (even longer for the OT), even if I follow everything in it with my heart, I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I'm doing the will of God.  : Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is : their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.  Well, if God respects it so much, how come there is talk in the Bible about eternal damnation for non-believers?  I see little respect eminating from the god of the Bible.  I see a selfish and spiteful god.  : God be with you,  Not yours, thanks ;)  : Malcolm Lee  :)  Rob Lanphier lanphi872@snake.cs.uidaho.edu lanph872@uidaho.edu  And for the curious, here is my earlier post:\",\" Here's one I remember: (sort of) Yogi's asleep in a hotel room late at night and gets a call from someone.

Burleigh Grimes went from 20+ wins and an ERA of 3 or so in '24 to 13-19 and an ERA around 4 in '25.  He pitched well for several more years.  Carlton won 13 and lost 20 the year after his 27-10 record. (Source: Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract.)      And let's not forget John Tudor, who started 1-5 and finished 21-6 in 1985.  He had a pretty bad ERA when you take Busch Stadium into account at the start of the season.        If I recall, he had a 4.50 ERA in the 1st half and a 3.50 ERA in the 2nd half of last year.        Hmmm, 21 runs in 11 innings.  Suppose he starts 30 more games, and winds up w/200 innings pitched.  If he allows 4 runs a game in the next 189 innings, he'll have a 4.75 ERA or so at the end of the year. (I think I have his totals right.) This is going to be hard to come back from.        My 1st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy, and that he may be pitching through an injury and not telling anyone.  My 2nd guess is that he will be banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts. (Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL?  Or will Danny Cox, who went 3 or 4 scoreless innings against the Tribe today, start for Morris?  He looks like a really good one.  Gaston is scrambling to find starters, I'd imagine. Luckily, the Jays have a very good offense.)      I don't think they would dare release him before the end of the year. He'll just be replaced by Stewart or Cox.\",\"Hi,  My name is rahul and I am doing MS at USU, Logan My query is:  I have a HP workstation: HP Series 400 with X running on it.

Maybe this would make a useful FAQ\",\"To what follows, our moderator has already answered the charge of  arrogance more ably that I could have done so, so I will confine myself to answering the charge of illogic.     This is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is, or was, taught to think. It is the fundamental premis \\\"A is not not-A\\\". If a thing is true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic  asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word \\\"believe\\\", however. The weak sense means I am not sure. \\\"I believe Tom went to  the library.\\\" (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense means I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. \\\"I believe  that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws.\\\" (despite  the fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian belief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological  topics.)    Note that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the  majority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that if Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be false, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity.  (And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)    It is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless  they have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks and wants.   Most Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living tradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly by the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.   If depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we  may both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive that he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.    Thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being  can find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find  absolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who does not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.   Here I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the knowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass  is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half full: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole point of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist and the optimist express the *same* fact.)   It is, of course, quite true that different people may express the  same belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail to understand each other's words as expressions of the same belief and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great scisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal agreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs are equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict some other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have been stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must, **necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical to say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct,  but if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as long as we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other  as in error.\",\"Ron Roth recommends: \\\"Once you have your hypoglycemia CONFIRMED through the                          proper channels, you might consider ther following:...\\\"                         [diet omitted]  1) Ron...what do YOU consider to be \\\"proper channels\\\"...this sounds suspiciously like a blood chemistry...glucose tolerance and the like...suddenly chemistry  exists?

These things sacred to Himself.  He may place any  pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.  Moreover, there are precedents in scripture where knowledge of sacred things is withheld:  1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructed Peter, James, and John to \\\"tell the vision to no  man, until the Son of man be risen again from  the dead\\\" (Matt. 17:9).   If we were living at the time of Savior, there would be no (public) record of this event.  2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision  of \\\"paradise\\\" when he \\\"heard unspeakable words,  which it is not lawful for a man to utter\\\" (2 Cor. 12:4). This person heard something which Paul can not  write to the Corinthians (and us).  3. There is an incident recorded in the Book of Mormon where words uttered by \\\"babes\\\" were  \\\"forbidden that there should not any man write them (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text follows for those of you without access to the BOM).  3 Nephi 26:16 Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the  multitude gathered themselves together, and they both saw and heard these children; yea, even  babes did open their mouths and utter marvelous things; and the things which they did utter were forbidden that there should not any man write them.  Some LDS scholars speculate that these words which could not be written are the sacred portions from temple we are to withhold from  the world (but it could be something else).   There is much we can discuss about the temple  ordinances.  We can discuss regarding baptisms and other vicarious ordinances for the dead. We can discuss certain concepts regarding the endowment (\\\"the ritual\\\"). However, there are certain elements I can not discuss with anyone (including other saints) outside of the temple. As a portion of the endowment, we receive the tokens and signs that will permit us access to Heaven.  I must keep this knowledge sacred  and respect the conditions under which it is revealed to me.\",\"The Armenians were deeply anti-semitic as well.

You either set the number of wait states to accomodate the slow RAM (in which case, all memory will run at that slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash.

Given about $10k in lab equipment and chemicals (which are commercially available) and given the knowledge that I have (graduating BS, Ch, 1993) I could  synthesize enough of these compounds to make a serious dent in the population of several major US cities.  As also noted, the knowledge is there for the production of nuclear weapons.  It's not even that restricted.  The only thing is the expense.    Now I'm not going around making these things, but it's not 'cause of any law; I simply don't get any marginal benefit out of killing anyone.  Any law you enact in this respect is only going to give you the ability to  add a charge against someone who does make and use said weapons.  In the case of chemical agents, I seriously doubt that you would even know that someone had set up a lab until after the weapons had been used.    Part of the trouble with the chemical-weapons ban treaty between the US and the USSR is that many of the precursors to chemical weapons such as GB and Sarin, etc., is that they have very valid commercial uses, and  it is very easy to divert those precursors to chemical weapons manufacture without anyone knowing about it.   \",\"Hi:  I am digitizing a NTSC signal and displaying on a PC video monitor. It is known that the display response of tubes is non-linear and is sometimes said to follow Gamma-Law. I am not certain if these non-linearities are \\\"Gamma-corrected\\\" before encoding NTSC signals or if the TV display is supposed to correct this.   Also, if  256 grey levels, for example, are coded in a C program do these intensity levels appear with linear brightness on a PC monitor? In other words does PC monitor display circuitry correct for \\\"gamma errrors\\\"?   Your response is much appreciated.   Amjad.\",\"   The worst thing is that this is exactly what I did last year.

Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specifically the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats) will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user, and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed.  Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate with impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from key escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means.  Because life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal very large and conspicuous property (luxury cars), it is reasonable to assume that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous property (a cipher cellular phone).  Just as we have seen in the past with \\\"blue box\\\" technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones, we can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakes criminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stolen instruments.  Because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days, a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.  There will be a continuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies.  In other words, Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, and persistent threat to the general public.  On the other hand, if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a device in a mostly non-ciphered network, the communication will at least stand out as being unusual, and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation.  Finally, because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments, there will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communications in the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is discovered, and the instruments involved have been identified).  While recording and archiving may not be feasible for wireline networks, it is probably feasible across the more limited bandwidth of radio networks.  The existence of these recordings could open up vast potential for abuse.\",\"    Rather than decide which book you want to buy, you need to decide which programming interface you want to use, then buy the appropriate book.  I wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences between PHIGS and PEXlib (it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out pretty soon).  But here's a brief summary...  PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many devices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and take advantage of a 3D extension to X called \\\"PEX\\\".  PEXlib is a slightly \\\"lower\\\" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX extension to X.  Some advantages of using PEXlib... - Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS - Provides immediate mode capabilities - Is free of \\\"policy\\\" - PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support   features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).   PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.  Some advantages of using PHIGS... - Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones - Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output - PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier - PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you - PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.

The whole organization (read: EJ and Ley, and by default owner Richard Gordon because he was too much of a dupe to know how much he was being blind-sided by EJ) dumped on Francis all season, starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract, publicly  humiliating him, stripping him of the \\\"C\\\", and then trading him that Spring to the Penguins. Classy guy, that EJ.  The loss of Francis (and too a lesser extent, Ulf), was one of a series of decimating player moves by EJ which stripped the personality and fan-awareness from the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today.

Encrypted text/sound/video is just another form of expression of that particular text/sound/video.

Nobuya \\\"Higgy\\\" Higashiyama replied (as, in substance, did others):   > Where is your source of moral standards by which you judge God's  > behavior?  It is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge God's actions.  Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a contrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of   + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.  + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?  + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!  + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  I am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and can perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as   + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!  There are those who say that the definition of \\\"good\\\" is \\\"whatever God happens to want.\\\" But if that is so, then the statement that God is good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants. That being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He is good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is powerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he tells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes sense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you don't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to Genesis 18 and to Christianity in general.  Any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any further discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God) meaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements are always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements in particular cases about the course of action most likely to achieve a good result.  When I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in history, those actions often seem to me very different from what I might expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us. Moreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural world, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might \\\"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of the Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort of difficulties that they find in Nature.\\\")  Now, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an argument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God. On the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose that I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every time he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: \\\"Good move! Just what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if I were playing.\\\" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a chess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at least some of his moves will have me thinking, \\\"Now, what do suppose induced him to do that?\\\" or even, \\\"Boy, that was a real slip -- he's just thrown the game away!\\\" Similarly, if God understands the workings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that sometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.  One difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the controls of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess game. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was carelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier. However, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did not take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had thought.  With God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total result of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging that I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier than my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.       *****     *****     *****     *****     *****  In the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers, who (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell him into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and when there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his family. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \\\"Do not worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.\\\"           The history of the Jews is largely a history of events    that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued    survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,    amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews    and of Judaism.         The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup    of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of    the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out    of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if    they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have    intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into    their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few    generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a    disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into    the Promised Land.         Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered    sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,    destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of    the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would    be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.    Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of    assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the    worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility    cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human    sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never    again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.    Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the    Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.         Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming    simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only    prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem    every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,    with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place    of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the    Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in    danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,    that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the    controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish    people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge    of all humans everywhere.         Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by    that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather    the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined    to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and    the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might    think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.    The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah    portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage    from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss    that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of    Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)    were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it    had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would    probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism    saved them.          [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]          Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became    famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR    LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,    everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on    stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the    studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast    Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she    later realized that if she had played the screen role, she    would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.    It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney    offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for    it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking    at Walt Disney, she said, \\\"And now, my special thanks to the    man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\\\" It was the most    memorable line of the evening.         In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in    the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive    to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing    with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus    Epiphanes....  After the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him privately and said, \\\"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren't you?\\\" He answered, \\\"If that is an example that came to your mind, then you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not talk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\\\" I assume that he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no state of Israel.  Someone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion that God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His purposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that He stirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and that when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go. And this raises questions about how an action can be considered wicked and at the same time be considered something that God has brought about.  I suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log, instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot that spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers the wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the knot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that observers will say: \\\"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its presence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a great work of art.\\\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was looking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not contained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art, but a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God would still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people, but He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not betrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected Jesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if Pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set Jesus free, it might appear that there would have been no Crucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no Salvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If Judas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled the world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know how Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its interior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and just as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth game agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops and had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up the game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is none the less valid).  Thus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of Pilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice was not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's plans by behaving justly and courageously.  What, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \\\"I will harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go\\\"? Some Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet with God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty were not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather that what God was telling Moses was something like this: \\\"If you see that Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be discouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My purposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and let the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his resistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future historians and theologians will suppose that I would have been thrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\\\"  To return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible that the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are instruments of God's will?      First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what Joseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong. They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment.      Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the good He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.\",\"I guess that makes Altima the most generic car in the US. \",\"  What \\\"it may think is right\\\" may be exactly what the user wants.

The memoirs of many  Russian officers who served in the east at this time are filled with   accounts of the revolting atrocities committed by these Armenian   guerrillas, which were savage even by relatively primitive standards of  war then observed in such areas.[1]\\\"  [1] \\\"Journal de Guerre du Deuxieme d'Artillerie de Forteresse Russe       d'Erzeroum,\\\" 1919, p. 28.  : >honored me by reproducing my text.

How could you? Because there is none.   Like conversing with a brick wall. And you are not responding to what I  am writing. By the way, that \\\"bullshit\\\" is justly regarded as the first  instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people. For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people lived  on their homeland - the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet  and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The  Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its  Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the  remainder driven out of their homeland. After one thousand years,  Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds.   The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.  Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and  Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.  Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its  predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against  humanity.  x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims  by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds.

I'am arguing about  : the Armenian-Nazi colaboration during World War II. Any comment?   It could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941,  while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration  camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian  battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had  grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the  cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party  leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by  this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed  and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the  members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of  extermination of the Jews.  This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \\\"encore\\\" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.  Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province of Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia claimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia (around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it had already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who could be expected to oppose their plans.   On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian and military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even  though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over 60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the  British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left  the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few  Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One British soldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring.   Rawlinson wired to his superiors,   \\\"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in  independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops   being without discipline and not being under effective control,  atrocities were constantly being committed.\\\"    Come again?  : \\\"These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...

All barracks buildings of Erzincan, the cavalry barracks in Erzurum,  the Government building and Army Corps Headquarters are among those  burnt.

In the NT, it is expected that when believers gather,   - people will prophesy   - the prophecy must be judged (1 Cor 14:29) There is nothing about killing someone who makes a mistake.   Scripture is scripture; there is no \\\"gift of scripture\\\".  And I don't know about you, but I know that _I_ have made mistakes while filled with the spirit.  If you don't give grace to allow people to make mistakes, they will never grow in the use of the spiritual gifts!  When we minister in my small group, I encourage people to speak out any impressions or images they think might be from the Lord.  Only by trying will they know whether they were right or wrong -- and in either case, they'll have a better handle on it the next time.  Didn't you fall when you were learning to ride a bicycle?  But you kept on trying, and you learned both from your failures and your successes. Spiritual gifts are no different -- you get better with experience.   The canon of Scripture is complete.  Does this mean that God no longer speaks?  I have heard his voice -- not audibly (though some have), but clearly nonetheless.  Is what I heard equivalent to Scripture?  No.  I have never heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the Lord is on the same level as Scripture; on the contrary, those who are mature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow believers for judgement.  And the most reliable yardstick for judging prophecies is, certainly, the Scriptures themselves.  The canon is closed -- but God is not silent!   Does it matter what it is called?  The question is not how to label it, but how to receive it.  Words of knowledge, incidentally, are similar to prophecy (and sometimes the two overlap), but generally it is supernatural knowledge of some fact that could not be known otherwise.\",\"What causes those little brown spots on older people's hands?

This version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendar programs and digital watches...   Please let me know if you know any other tools, or if you have information or opinions on these ones, and I will update this FAQ.  I am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people who have evaluated them or are using them.     Richard Donkin                            Internet mail: richardd@hoskyns.co.uk               Tel: +44 71 814 5708 (direct) Fax: +44 71 251 2853  Changes in this version:       Added information on StressFree, another typing management tool       for Windows.   TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS: these aim to help you manage your keyboard use, by warning you to take a break every so often.  The better ones also include advice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to   warn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.  Often, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening. These tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your  body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.        Tool: At Your Service (commercial software)     Available from:  Bright Star  Tel: +1 (206) 451 3697     Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows     Description:  Provides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info.   Warns when to take a break (configurable).  Has a few recommendations  on posture, and exercises.  Sound-oriented, will probably work best   with sound card (PC) or with microphone (Mac).  Should be possible  to record your own messages to warn of break.       Tool: AudioPort (sound card and software)     Available from:  Media Vision  Tel: +1 (510) 226 2563     Platforms: PC     Description:  A sound card to plug into your PC parallel port.  Includes 'At Your Service'.       Tool: Computer Health Break (commercial software)     Available from:  Escape Ergonomics, Inc  1111 W. El Camino Real  Suite 109  Mailstop 403  Sunnyvale, CA  Tel: +1 (408) 730 8410     Platforms: DOS     Description:  Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take  breaks after a configurable interval, based on clock time, or  after a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier.  It gives you 3 exercises to do each time, randomly selected from  a set of 70.  Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work  you do - data entry, word processing, information processing.  Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on  how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does.   CHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use   to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other information  on non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.  A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.   CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then  warn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear  useful when used with Windows.   Cost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.      Comments:  The keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better  to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to  measure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff  is very good and includes some summaries of research papers,  as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company   to pay up for RSI management tools.        Tool: EyerCise (commercial software)     Available from:  RAN Enterprises  One Woodland Park Dr.  Haverhill, MA  01830, US  Tel: 800-451-4487 (US only)     Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS]     Description:  Aimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to take  breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionally  displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are  animated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the  correct rate.  Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training   exercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitions  you do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes.  Also includes online help   on workplace ergonomics.     Quote from their literature:   \\\"EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic  sets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work  all parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent  Repetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve  your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these  help you to become more relaxed and productive.\\\"    \\\"The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C.  Godnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup  for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to  promote healthy and efficient computer use.     Cost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts  for resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US).       Comments:  I have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say  it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it  does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it  interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which  is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on  Windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure  why. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has  one window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not  require any sound hardware.      Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)     Available from:  Visionary Software  P.O. Box 69447  Portland, OR  97201, US  Tel: +1 (503) 246-6200     Platforms: Mac, DOS (Windows version underway)     Description:  Aimed at preventing RSI.  Warns you to take a break  with dialog box and sound.  Includes a list of exercises  to do during breaks, and information on configuring your  workstation in an ergonomic manner.  Price: $59;  quantity discounts and site licenses.  The DOS product is  bought in from another company, apparently; not sure how  equivalent this is to the Mac version.    The Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher   Magazine (Feb 1991).  Good marketing stuff with useful   2-page summaries of RSI problems and solutions, with   references.

Anon FTP:   ftp.cica.indiana.edu (and mirroring sites)      Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1) (Mac and DOS versions underway)     Description:  Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take  breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times).   Displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are  animated and program paces you to help you do exercises at the  correct rate.  Quite a few exercises, can configure which ones  are included to some extent.  Online help.   Version 2.0 is out soon, Mac and DOS versions will be based  on this.   Cost: $29.95 if support via CompuServe or Internet, otherwise $39.95.                 Site license for 3 or more copies is $20.00 each.        (NOTE: prices may have gone up for V2.0).       Comments:  I have had a play with this, and it works OK.  Its user interface  design is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual.  expensive tool around and it does the job.  It is also the only  tool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it  on your local bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers!  Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does   have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence,  which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.      Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)     Available from:  Email to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar     Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)     Description:  This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you  to stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously  typing.  It does not provide exercises, but it does check  that you really do take a break, and tells you when you  can start typing again.     Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing  today, each time it warns you, which is useful so you  know how much you *really* type.  It also logs information  to a file that you can analyse or simply print out.     The warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),  in a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message  (for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu>   has put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for   X, Zephyr and Mach.   Not formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk  (for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,  X Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give   feedback.      Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs     Available from:  Various sources     Platforms: Various     Description:  Any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming  appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.  Or, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit  a program to run at a specific time to display a message to  the screen.   Using Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and  include this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so  you get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you  want to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.  Press F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter  9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break  is for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat   for the next appointment.   By using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes  that set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this  file on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with  a single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments  with RSI exercises.   The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs.   An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job  that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will  depend a lot on your operating system.   While these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing   yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI   management tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to  write a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating  system, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.      Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers     Available from:  Various sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.     Description:  Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable  number of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either  manually or automatically.     While these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you  are writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from  a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great  advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you  are doing.       Comments:  My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to  my writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which  actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left  arm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been  very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.   I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but  these are not much good because they do not give an audible  warning of the end of the time period!   KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.   One-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how  you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing, and may therefore make matters worse.      Tool: hsh (public domain)     Available from:  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar     Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones)     Description:  Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.  Only works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or  an xterm, but not most X programs).      Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)     Available from:  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c  Also built into Windows 3.x.      Description:  The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout  that involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent  RSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since   it will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)   \",\"In Detroit, the octopus is a symbol from the old days of the league. In the era of the Original 6, four teams made the playoffs.  To win the Cup, a team had to win two seven-game series - in other words it took 8 playoff wins to win the Cup.  The octopus (8 legs) has become a common Detroit symbol.  Every year around playoff time people start sneaking octopus (octopi?) into the Joe Louis Arena and throwing them onto the ice.\",\"Seems that the Mile-Long Billboard and any other inflateble space object/station or what ever have the same problems.

Also what if the billboard springs a leak? Self sealing and such??   Just thinking (okay rambling)..  Also why must the now inflated billboard, not be covered in the inside by a harder substance (such as a polymer or other agent) and then the now \\\"hard\\\" billboard would be a now giant docking structure/space dock/station??\",\" I don't know if this is still true, but at one time Coca-Cola took elaborate measures to keep the formula secret.  For instance, several plants in different cities each made one of six partial concentrates, which were then shipped back-and forth and remixed in a complicated scheme so that no single plant made the whole formula.  By now, I would guess that PepsiCo's chemists would have reverse-engineered it; can't be all that exotic.

I'm thinking that education suppliers for schools might have a appartus for sale, but I don't know any of the companies. Any info is greatly appreciated.  In case you don't know, Krillean Photography, to the best of my knowledge, involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic object between charged plates. The picture will show energy patterns or spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what type of object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary. One might extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within the universe (as we know it) has its own energy signature.  \",\"Dear Rob,   Sometimes I do come across condesending, and I am sorry I come across that way at times.  Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll try to get better.  Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far, only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.  Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K.  vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.   I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with his set of excuses.    I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.  From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I  see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away from the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see the dialog:   Me:  \\\"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\\\"   BK:  \\\"There is no truck.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around at look.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at      the oncoming truck.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around or you will run over.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\\\"  Me:  \\\"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing       to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\\\"       I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.  BK:  \\\"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.       Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\\\"       And by the way, I really have an open mind.\\\"   So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?     I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have. I can now see the truck behind Brian.  My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment, Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his head will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. \",\"   That brings up an interesting point. Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked  at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they were 24, and noticed some interesting things.     For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also   found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away the second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc.     It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory.     I guess Ray Knight makes his rebuttal tonight.   \",\"  The description of the chip's operation evidently leaves out some of the key management aspects.  Either the K_P is the secret key corresponding to a public key which is broadcast at message initiation, or it is the result of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange or something similar.

This description   1. ignores the role of the ballast,  2. misrepresents the heating effects in the starter.  The bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts short circuit, because the neon discharge stops, and much less heat is generated from the I^2R loss in the metal as compared to the neon discharge.  The starter contacts open before the tube fires.  Actually, the tube fires as a result of the back-emf generated in the ballast because of this immediate opening of the starter's contacts.  A capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent excessive arcing during the firing.

First the scriptural quotations:  This sort of reasoning is such that if you beleive you are justified, if not then your beleif is in vain, so you might as well beleive.  Most of these quotations are of people who do beleive.  People who would try to justify their own positions.  Second the logical proof:    The period of time that has elapsed from the event growing larger does not increase the odds that a hoax would be discovered.  In fact the longer a hoax is perpetuated the stronger it becomes.  Finally:  There is no proof of the resurrection of Christ, except in our spirits communion with his, and the Father's.

Most X servers use a version of  malloc(3)  which will not return   memory to the OS (ie. the X server might  free(3)  a Pixmap, but the heap does   not shrink).    Well, part of the routines I mentioned do a dirty little trick to get around   that problem. First, I create the shared memory segment, attach the client,   attach the X server, and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man   pages on removing of shared memory segments, you will see that the segment   only dies after all attachments are gone.   Now, if the client dies, that's one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you)   and since the X server notices the client has dies, frees up it's resources,   including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment. No more   shared memory segment.   Terrible, but it works.      Regards,\",\"Dear Netters I want to send EMG-signals from a running person to a computer.  Each signal is 4KHz wide and there is up to 30 of them on each running person. The signal is only to be sent over a few hundred  meters.

To make the transmitters as light as possible I suppose it will be best  the to send the signals in an analog form.

As for how foods taste:  If I'm not allergic to MSG and I like the taste of it, why shouldn't I use it?  Saying I shouldn't use it is like saying I shouldn't eat spicy food because my neighbor has an ulcer.  People have long modified the taste of food by additives, whether they be chiles, black pepper, salt, cream sauces, etc.  All of these things cloud the flavor of the food.

The system boots up if the Tandberg is disconnected from the system, and of course no SCSI devices found (I have no other SCSI devices).  The system boots up if the Seagate MFM controller is removed from the system. The Future Domain card reports finding the Tandberg 3660 on the SCSI bus. The system then of course stops booting because my MFM hard disks can't be found.  The system hangs if all three (Tandberg, Future Domain TMC-1660 & Seagate MFM controller) are in the system.   Looks like there is some conflict between the Seagate and Future Domain card. But the funny thing is that it only hangs if the Tandberg is connected.

Not much it seems.    It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about. If only those christian \\\"scientists\\\" would take note.  (In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian  scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics.  For example, there are a few chaps who are  trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed  light has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been  accounted for. :-] )   Or (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never  intended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one up?   Millions of people have \\\"died for a lie\\\".  This  point is difficult to  substantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments work in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed  themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.     That is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone) to become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to the claim that Jesus was the \\\"real thing\\\".    Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the point, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based  (I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with  his principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler was sane....      Hmmm.... I don't think his arguments warrant the use of a \\\"Therefore...\\\"   This is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or she will end up in all sorts of shit.     Tony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone,  who thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say \\\"a is equal to b because a is equal to b\\\".       That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed  in religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be correct.    It   I think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flames than here :-).  I have never really understood why the emotional sentiments of a stranger should be of interest to other people.

Just the Skipjack  cryptographic algorithm? Or does it also implement a \\\"chip to chip\\\"  communications protocol? If it does implement a communications  protocol, can it be used as just a \\\"crypt chip\\\" also.    2) Where can the chip specifications and spec sheets be obtained?    3) Who may purchase them and under what conditions?    4) Are there restrictions as to how the chip may be used in a system?    5) The security of the algorithm and the encrypted communications does  not appear to require that the \\\"Family key\\\" be a secret. Why is  it a secret? What happens when the \\\"family key\\\" becomes well known?  If it's a secret to make traffic analysis more difficult, does  the \\\"Law enforcement message\\\" contain any random information?

Typical posting:  Why have a newsgroup about atheism?  Why do atheists organize in groups?   What is there to discuss?  Response:  Many things are discussed here, including:  * Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's   family * Prayer in schools * Discrimination against atheists * Sunday trading laws * The Satanic Child Abuse myth * Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet' * How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students * How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers * Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual * Why people become atheists  Of course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians looking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't  want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure  from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.  ------------------------------  Subject: Hitler was an atheist!  Typical posting:  Hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!  Response:  Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:     The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in    his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_    superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_    not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]     For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their    abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the    Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be    active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every    man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who    in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his    religious community and tries to butt into the other.     [...]     Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will    of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_    fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]            -- Adolf Hitler, from \\\"Mein Kampf\\\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.  Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed  to believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist,  though.  ------------------------------  Subject: The Bible proves it  Typical posting:  In the Bible it says that...  Response:  Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable accuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed 'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The Bible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted.  Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to \\\"interpretation\\\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and one thing only is not legitimate.  Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.  It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: Pascal's Wager  Typical posting:  If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing -- but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.  Response:  This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.  Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often described as the \\\"avoiding the wrong hell\\\" problem.  If a person is a follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.  Secondly, the statement that \\\"If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing\\\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness. Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer.  Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that  the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of  comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God  is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.  Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on  evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or  cost-benefit analysis.  Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:    1. One does not know whether God exists.   2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does      exist.   3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.   4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.  There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at no \\\"cost\\\".  The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The argument thus collapses to \\\"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests to believe in God\\\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal intended the argument to be viewed.  The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him.  ------------------------------  Subject: What is Occam's Razor?  Typical posting:  People keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?  Response:  William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's  Razor.  In its original form, it said \\\"Do not multiply entities  unnecessarily.\\\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity, then do so.  Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it  more generally, for example as \\\"Take the simplest solution\\\".  The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations  for what we see around us:  1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which came into being as a result of natural processes.  2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and  there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be  of non-zero complexity.  Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest  that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one. Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:  3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.   We just imagine that there is.  This third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people  find unacceptable.   ------------------------------  Subject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus  Typical posting:  I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.  Response:  Preaching is not appreciated.  Feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that are on a \\\"conversion\\\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup talk.religion.misc).  You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would have them do unto you!  Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy analogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the basic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it, since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why I know that God exists  Typical posting:  I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.  Response:  Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist.  That evidence varies from person to person.  Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been abducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.  ------------------------------  Subject: Einstein and \\\"God does not play dice\\\"  Typical posting:  Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?  Response:  Einstein did once comment that \\\"God does not play dice [with the universe]\\\".  This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the Christian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore, Einstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.  A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following: \\\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.\\\"  Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an objective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that QM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found, and much evidence suggests that it never will be.  A longer quote from Einstein appears in \\\"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A Symposium\\\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In    \\\"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events    the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side    of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him    neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an    independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a    personal God interfering with natural events could never be    *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this    doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific    knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.     But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives    of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine    which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,    will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm    to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers    of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal    God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past    placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they    will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable    of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity    itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably    more worthy task...\\\"     \\\"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,    a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a    personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.    If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the    unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our    science can reveal it.\\\"  The latter quote is from \\\"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\\\", edited by Helen  Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.   Also from the same book:    \\\"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics    to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind     it.\\\"  Of course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does  not in itself imply that Christianity is false.  ------------------------------  Subject: Everyone worships something  Typical posting:  Everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.  Response:  If that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for example) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why there must be a causeless cause  Typical posting:  Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so chains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.  Response:  The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has no smallest member.  Further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed  Typical posting:  The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you don't think all this appeared here just by chance?  Response:  This is known as the Argument From Design.  It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk.origins for a while.  There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here. However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence, observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth.  The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some  external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately.  But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist position.  This leads us to the familiar theme of \\\"If a creator created the universe, what created the creator?\\\", but with the addition of spiralling  improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just \\\"is\\\" (or \\\"was\\\").  From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just \\\"is\\\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book \\\"A Brief History of Time\\\", explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.  The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called  Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it evolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the  watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the  universe too must have a creator.  The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above  those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates  watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have  created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are  clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.  Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in  the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear  reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument  would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a  different part of creation.  Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that  the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore  stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the  argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not  random, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus  internally inconsistent.  ------------------------------  Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true  Typical posting:  The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence.  For example...  Response:  The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence.  Early versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or James; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but that this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \\\"reconstructions\\\" of the original text have been published to this effect.  Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320 C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material.  Aside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is more well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently Asked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.  ------------------------------  Subject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem  Typical posting:  Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the Bible to be both true and complete.  Response:  Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal  system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary  arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be  valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically speaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal  system.)  Essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \\\"Liar  Paradox.\\\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \\\"This  sentence is false.\\\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal  system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.  The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.  One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom.  This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.  It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists within the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.  Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.  Another frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be both consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal systems, so such claims are nonsense.  ------------------------------  Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism  Typical posting:  Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?  Response:  The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I. Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman is a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the presidential primary:   RS: \\\"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in       God is important to me.\\\"   RS: \\\"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of       Americans who are atheists?\\\"   GB: \\\"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,       nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under       God.\\\"   RS: \\\"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation       of state and church?\\\"   GB: \\\"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not       very high on atheists.\\\"  UPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks.  The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27, 1989.  It can also be found in \\\"Free Enquiry\\\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue, Volume 8, Number 4, page 16.  On October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane, cochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a lawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School District 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \\\"one nation under God\\\" (Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:    RS: \\\"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.       Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\\\"    EM: \\\"It's bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"What is bullshit?\\\"    EM: \\\"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\\\"    RS: \\\"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush       campaign is on this issue.\\\"   EM: \\\"You're welcome.\\\"  After Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract his statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the President, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by    \\\"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports    atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or    supported by the government.\\\"  For further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American Atheist Press's Cameron Road address.  ------------------------------  Subject: I know where hell is!  Typical posting:  I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!  Response:  There are several towns called \\\"Hell\\\" in various countries around the world, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now  getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.  ------------------------------  Subject: Biblical contradictions wanted  Typical posting:  Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?  Response:   American Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical contradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for details.  There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the archive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the United States be considered a Christian nation?  Response:  Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear that they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some quotes; there are many more.    \\\"What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?    In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the    ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen    upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been    the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert    the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient    auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,    needs them not.\\\"       - James Madison, \\\"A Memorial and Remonstrance\\\", 1785    \\\"I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of    the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.    Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!\\\"       - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson    \\\"History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people    maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of    ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will    always avail themselves for their own purpose.\\\"        - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813    \\\"I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or    requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely    above it.\\\"        - Benjamin Franklin, from \\\"Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion\\\",         Nov. 20, 1728  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is not a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Is it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any sense founded upon the Christian religion?  Response:  No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):     Article 11     As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense    founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of    enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as    the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility    against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no    pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption    of the harmony existing between the two countries.  The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections such as Charles Bevans' \\\"Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776-1949\\\", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).  The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on June 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.  The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul General at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of Christianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there is no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.  In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation. \",\"JL-NS>Subject: Re: Motorcycle Courier (Summer Job)  I'd like to thank everyone who replied.

Seriously though, even the Sheiks at Al-Azhar don't claim that the Shi'ites are heretics. Most of the accusations and fabrications about Shi'ites come out of Saudi Arabia from the Wahabis. For that matter you should read the original works of the Sunni Imams (Imams of the four madhabs).

They believe the danger is real, but others may not.   Does that mean that the first group are NECESSARILY arrogant in warning  others of the danger? Does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs  are correct, and all others are false?

However, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all five schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against muslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do not know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and open hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know that historically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone by the death penalty.  My understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the law of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the Qur'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy.  I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \\\"fasad\\\". This ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.   I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book. However, the charge of \\\"fasad\\\" can encompass a number of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that the condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the \\\"crisis\\\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people, not books.  The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz, presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred.  Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this point that the fatwa on \\\"fasad\\\" was issued.  The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The crime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being played out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.\",\"Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part08 Last-modified: 1993/4/15   FAQ for sci.crypt, part 8: Technical Miscellany  This is the eighth of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ.

WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.   The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password   and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full   descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli   [BER91].    decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution.    There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,   Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will   decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox   files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you   think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a   call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files   that have a 10 char or less pw key.''  * How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?    A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the   plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.   If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the   following:     1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.   (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of   the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal.    If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something   over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different   key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes   of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which   indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.    2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This   removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since   English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of   text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing   plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact   one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)    If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a   standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis   texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in   the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.   See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].  * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]    Here's one popular method, using the des command:      cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail    Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called   PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through   1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.   There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this   writing.    There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting   mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own   newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ   as well.    PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm   without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)   in the USA.    RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which   is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside   the USA.    Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of   the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the   message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there   have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and   algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as   we know).  * Is the UNIX crypt command secure?    No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt   breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks   on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].  * How do I use compression with encryption?    A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by   some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).    Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact   distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's   impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse   characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up   more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy   has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some   redundancy in your compressed output.    Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they   have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that   actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of   UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''   that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.      This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a   bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means   removes the need for strong encryption.    Compression after encryption is silly.  * Is there an unbreakable cipher?    Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the   one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as   plaintext.    Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be   useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by   likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is   expected to remain valid.  * What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?    Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom   number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be   cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to   predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of   the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of   0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.    A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function   of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently   random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by   the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps   generated by a hardware random number source).    Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,   generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of   entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,   cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo    gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in   it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,   for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random   string.    When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is   important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that   because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \\\"random\\\".  For   example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be   unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a   clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.  * What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?    See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount   of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in   the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number   of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this   can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to   back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis.    Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have   multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security   from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.    Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic   measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives   probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext   for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible   plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys   are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally   deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine   the likelihood of events of interest.    Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than   D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not   enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of   possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,   which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to   8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but   the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work   required to find the key after approximately D characters have been   intercepted.    In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used   in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key   size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if   it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few   practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all   manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack   some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic   considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a   recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.   Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and   information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most   promising directions.    Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information   statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal   1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the   possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].  * What is key management and why is it important?    One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in   full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,   and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of   course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling   Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)   Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can   eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in   modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are   transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but   also enough key material to cover the traffic.    Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and   handling of keys.    A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology   is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use   employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key   Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that   certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control   personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and   to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the   reporting of lost CIKs.    This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management   problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,   many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''  * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?    Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from   relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a   linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random   number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds   and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a   high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically   this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for   cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more   complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---   but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable   structure at all.    See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].  * What is the correct frequency list for English letters?    There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than   the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:   namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of   English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,   but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.    The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do   you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a   fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It   has changed over time; it is different between different authors.   Any particular message will have different statistics from those of   the language as a whole.    The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have   exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all   reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.   In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other   buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood   estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a   text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with   reasonably robust answers.    So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will   be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.  * What is the Enigma?    ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of   information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by   the British during WWII.''    See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].  * How do I shuffle cards?    Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of   values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output   permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you   need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly   distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that   function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH   is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two   addresses given)    for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;    modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since   ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the   error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s   modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less   than y, go back and get another ranno() value.   * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?    Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with   possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted   separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps   even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.    As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard   PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the   keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be   encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in   part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one   of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.    If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must   be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in   the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.   The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the   illegal copy.   * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?

It would relieve the various states of the thorny problem of what to do with the hundreds of millions of dollars hunters pour into the economy annually.

I am equally confident that these same entities, given their noteworthy record in the area of social responsibility and respect for private property, would feel morally and ethically bound to raise the necessary funds to acquire the hundreds of thousands of acres of land now held in private hands solely for use as private hunting preserves by the landowner(s). To do less than this would place these same groups/individuals in the ethically untenable (to say nothing of environmentally and politically incorrect) position of sanctioning the logging and subsequent development and urbanization of these former private hunting lands, which would no longer be useable by, or of any benefit to, the landowner(s) in such a capacity.\",\"If anyone's still interested, I have ONE Mattel electronic game left for sale or trade.

All of which require something we Christians readily admit to: ``Faith''.  The fact that there are several candidates belies that *none* are conclusive.   With out conclusive evidence, we are left with faith.  It could even be argued that one of these hypotheses may one day be proven (as best as a non-repeatable event can be \\\"proven\\\").  But I ask, what holds   someone *today* to the belief that any or all of them are correct, except by  faith?  [ a couple of paragraphs deleted.

Carefully examine the original question, and then the \\\"counter-question\\\".  The first asks \\\"Why\\\", while the second is a request for definition.  It  doesn't address why something does or does not exist, but asks to define  the lack of existence.  The second question is unanswerable indeed, for how do we identify something as \\\"nothing\\\" (aren't they mutually exclusive terms)?.  How do we identify a state of non-existence (again, this is nearing the limits of this simple layman's ability to comprehend, and I would appreciate an explanation).   I might add, the worldview of \\\"Things that exist do, and things that don't...don't\\\" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable, as does the theist's belief in God.  It is based on the assumption that there is *not* a reason for being, something as ultimately (un)supportable as the position of there being a reason.  Its very foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there *is* a reason.  We come to this. Either \\\"I am, therefore I am.\\\", or \\\"I am for a reason.\\\" If the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are satisfied, and need not a doctor.  If the latter, your search is just beginning.    = I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.

It would lead me to question their definition of Christianity as well.  = Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence. = This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God = Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence, = it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always = existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.  This does not preclude His existence.

Being an atheist myself, I do not = accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.  Like the theist, we come to a statement of faith, for this position assumes  that the evidence at hand is conclusive.  Note, I am not arguing against  scientific endeavor, for science is useful for understanding the universe in which we exist. But I differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective.  I seek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the Creator.  I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer \\\"why\\\".   It appears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool is inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting that 'why' is an invalid question does not provide an answer.    = : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \\\"why\\\".

I certainly hope we've gotten beyond the \\\"shooting the messenger\\\" stage).  M. Pihko does present a good point though.  We may need to ask \\\"What do I  as an individual Christian base my faith on?\\\"  Will it be shaken by the production of evidence that shatters our \\\"sacred cows\\\" or will we seek to understand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what God *said* (and continues to say) in his Word?  \\\"Why do I ask why?\\\" (apologies to Budweiser and company 8^]).

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to    accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure    telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.     For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our    private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the    tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of    protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate    the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and    law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against    industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.     Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to    protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to    protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption    technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the    unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used    by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.     A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has    been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a    new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,    relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to    an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications    using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in    commercial use today.     This new technology will help companies protect proprietary    information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations    and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted    electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the    ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to    intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.      A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the    \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding    Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique          2      \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government    agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the    device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately    in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the    Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to    government officials with legal authorization to conduct a    wiretap.     The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no    new authorities to access the content of the private    conversations of Americans.     To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the    Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new    devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the    government will be offered access to the confidential details of    the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report    their findings.     The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of    encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the    privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield    criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other    approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access    to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it    to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology    trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),    the President has directed government agencies to develop a    comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:   --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to       employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;   --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone       calls and data, under proper court or other legal       order, when necessary to protect our citizens;   --   the effective and timely use of the most modern       technology to build the National Information       Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and       the competitiveness of American industry in the global       marketplace; and    --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export       high technology products.     The President has directed early and frequent consultations with    affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the    privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.           3     The Administration is committed to working with the private    sector to spur the development of a National Information    Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer    technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to    information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks    (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV    programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone    system transmits voice.     Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important    role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act    quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding    its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that    protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting    them from those who break the law.     Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.     The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new    encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with  no new authorities to access the content of the private  conversations of Americans.     Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on  a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation  encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to  decipher the message?     A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a  court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They  would then present documentation of this authorization to  the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and  obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug  smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are  stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key  escrow system.     Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?     A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent  entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the  Administration have yet to determine which agencies will  oversee the key-escrow data banks.     Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure  how strong the security is?       A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption  systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will  remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow  system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of  cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all  potential users that there are no unrecognized  vulnerabilities.     Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?     A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the  Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in  this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the  President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet  officials.     Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?     A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on  encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify  as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have  briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the  decisions related to this initiative.     Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?     A:   The government designed and developed the key access  encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the  microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product  manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip  manufacturer that produces them.     Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?     A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,  California, and will sell the chip to encryption device  manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed  to other vendors in the future.     Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?      A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating  the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.     Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological  solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be  willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more  powerful encryption devices?     A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be  considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow  mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product  that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive  than others readily available today, but it is just one  piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to  encryption technology, which the Administration is  developing.   The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption  threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,  we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have  effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every  American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an  unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a  false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is  an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,  and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,  balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper  Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.     Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton  Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from  that of the Bush Administration?       A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption  technology in telecommunications and computing and are  committed to working with industry and public-interest  groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'  privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law  enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime  and terrorism.     Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use  the government hardware?\",\"From my rather rusty knowledge of radio, most radio receivers use a superhet  circuit, so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator, giving  a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) that is more easily amplified. The detector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radar  detector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there  are/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't  paid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the roof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF.   I wonder how much of the IF is radiated back from the detector antenna, and  how much from the rest of the module. It might be worth putting the detector  in a proper RF shielded enclosure. \",\"Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or contribution to:  In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  If you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine.  The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle (even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of the law is no excuse - they will get you too!  It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors.  Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was \\\"no way!\\\"  But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police are writing citations right and left for people using radar detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one, and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.  Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.  For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave enlightment may be necessary.  So, the questions are -   What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?   Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by   a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector   antenna?

Your assistance would be greatly appreciated\",\" Ben,  Since you're obviously adept enough to understand how the trackball works, the only thing short of repairing it that I can think of is a thorough cleaning of all the parts, and then checking for the proper placement of the little blue rollers. Since they aren't fixed in position on their stainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different position. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of contact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the ball, not the center cylindrical area.  I've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but needs to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our office's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one could still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might help.  I would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If you can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl  alcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free.  If you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see if it is actually causing the axle to spin.   If all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-( It could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be necessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that dirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction.  Hope this helps,  Murray   \",\"  Or he was just convinced by religious fantasies of the time that he was the Messiah, or he was just some rebel leader that an organisation of Jews built into Godhood for the purpose off throwing of the yoke of Roman oppression, or.......   Are the Moslem fanatics who strap bombs to their backs and driving into Jewish embassies dying for the truth (hint: they think they are)? Were the NAZI soldiers in WWII dying for the truth?   People die for lies all the time.    Was Hitler a liar? How about Napoleon, Mussolini, Ronald Reagan? We spend millions of dollars a year trying to find techniques to detect lying? So the answer is no, they wouldn't be able to tell if he was a liar if he only lied about some things.   Why do you think he healed people, because the Bible says so? But if God doesn't exist (the other possibility) then the Bible is not divinely inspired and one can't use it as a piece of evidence, as it was written by unbiased observers.   Were Hitler or Mussolini lunatics? How about Genghis Khan, Jim Jones... there are thousands of examples through history of people being drawn to lunatics.   So we obviously cannot rule out liar or lunatic not to mention all the other possibilities not given in this triad.   Possibly self-fulfilling prophecy (ie he was aware what he should do in order to fulfil these prophecies), possibly selective diting on behalf of those keepers of the holy bible for a thousand years or so before the general; public had access. possibly also that the text is written in such riddles (like Nostradamus) that anything that happens can be twisted to fit the words of raving fictional 'prophecy'.               [stuff about how hard it is to be a christian deleted]  I severely recommend you reconsider the reasons you are a christian, they are very unconvincing to an unbiased observer.\",\" I don't think FD is a problem.

As far as current investigations, the Church recently declared the      crying statue and corresponding messages from Mary at Akita,      Japan as approved (I found this out about a month ago.)   2.  Again in the proof department, start with the appearances of Mary      at Fatima.  Among other things, there were pictures taken of the      \\\"miracle of the sun\\\" that appeared in some major American newspaper      (The New York Times, I believe) as well as most of the major      European newspapers.

On another news group earlier this year, someone posted that the King James Bible was the divinely inspired version of the Bible in English and was, therefore, inerrant; all other English translations were from Satan, trying to deceive the body of Christ.  A few years ago, the pastor of a church I was attending showed me a poster advertising the availability of a certain man to address congregations. Very prominantly on the poster was the fact that the man used only the KJV. The idea that the KJV is THE English Bible is more prevalent than many might think.    -- Scott at Brandeis\",\" 1: \\\"90% of diseases\\\" is not the same thing as \\\"90% of patients\\\".     In a world with one curable disease that strikes 100 people, and nine    incurable diseases which strikes one person each, medical science will cure    91% of the patients and report that 90% of diseases have no therapy.  2: A disease would be counted among the 90% untreatable if nothing better than    a placebo were known.

Anyway, the SE makes this loud buzzing noise due to vibration somewheres. If I remove the screws and loosen the front from the back, it quiets down. I can only assume that the fan housing from this goofy thing is touching the back of the case and vibrating against it.

Although reverse lights on the sides are useful for telling whether cars are backing up out perpendicular to the path of the car, I don't think warnings were their original intents, since they are colored white.   \",\" You're obviously not referring to any of the three above-quoted individuals, because barnacles don't each send $20 to the crew of the ship to keep it moving.  \\\"Get the organization to act on it\\\" is easy to say, but says little about what one really can and should do.  What the organization actually will do is largely determined by the president and directors, as far as I can see.  That's what makes it so important to vote in an election of officers.  It does strike me that the BMWMOA is a lot less politically active (in the state and national arenas, not infighting) than other M/C organizations.  Should we change this?  Or just join the other groups that already are in politics?

However, Alomar had a higher Defensive Average.  So who would be better?  Using Alomar's opportunities (469 groundballs, 73 possible double plays) Alomar had 332 groundouts and turned 18 DPs. Baerga would have had (with same DA & DP%) 328 groundouts and 35 DPs.  Using Baerga's opportunites (545 groundballs, 99 possible double plays). Alomar would have had (with the same DA & DP%) 386 groundouts and 25 DPs. Baerga had 381 groundouts and 47 DPs.  Baerga looks better, though it's possible his DP% would be lower with a  different SS.  Will Baerga consistently turn twice as many double plays, however?  Alomar has established a high level of defense, Baerga has not.  I would bet on Alomar to be better next year, but last year Baerga was just as good overall. --  Dale J.

Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the henrik]  KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan.   BM] Gimme a break.  CAPITAL letters, or NOT, the above is pure nonsense.  It BM] seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      Again, Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending themselves. What do      want them to do. Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them.  BM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment, BM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it BM] is a part of it.    Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged  training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.   henrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000  henrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the  henrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending  henrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION.   BM]  Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them BM]  within their borders?     Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into          the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.  henrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the  henrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER  henrik] OCCUR again.  BM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?     It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped    into Armenia if SHE could.   BM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header BM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?     Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many         cases, HISTORY repeats itself.   BM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes  BM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring BM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians  BM] are attacking Azeri towns.   So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey         wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!   I will believe it when I see it.   Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing         to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean  BURNING people ALIVE !  BM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  BM] futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  BM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  BM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.     Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are          NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN.   BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent  BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe  BM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better  BM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?   Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the  conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in  KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.  BM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes BM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of  BM] their blood and future.    Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension         to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH         are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.  BM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  BM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians BM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate  BM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in BM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.

Maddison and Hamilton were both studying existing forms of government for several years before they wrote the federalist papers. That the US system is based to a considerable degree on the UK model is pretty widely accepted. At the time there was no other major country with a representative body. The French plebicite had been suppressed for 140 years and its restoration eight years later would mark the start of the French revolution.   After the UK system the major influences were the Dutch system and of course the classical systems. Nobody seriously suggests that Rome or Greece were  models though because the political systems of both countries were acknowleged disasters. The main lesson learnt from Greece was that unless a federal state was constructed a war would be inevitable. The Greek democracies were always fighting amongst themselves which is how Rome managed to invade. Had the federal consitution been rejected the new Roman empire in the shape of Britain would quite certainly have reabsorbed much of the colonies in due course. Moreover the states would have been at each others throats as soon as the Louisiana purchase situation arose during the Napoleonic period. \",\" Seems to me folks, that if you are so interested in acquiring CNN, just buy your $1000 worth of stock today.

In case this puzzles people, I would like to expand on two of her comments.   One of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context, scope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces of evidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break the back of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to be filled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is a grave mistake to confuse these.  Past snippets from this thread:    Back to Lee Lady:   These posters are making the mistake that I have previously criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A \\\"carefully designed and controlled study\\\" is neither always possible nor always important.  (On the other hand, if someone is proposing a remedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, we have enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kind of claim to ask for a \\\"carefully designed and controlled study\\\" to alleviate our skepticism.)  Rules such as \\\"support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and controlled study\\\" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation. I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.  (To reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical problems are notoriously problematic.)  \",\"  There are, but not any that would help Texans: In many states, such laws have been found to violate the state constitution.

The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peace based on Godism.  The messiah's teachings will build on the foundation of the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God, the fall of man, the purpose of creation, and God's providence of restoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the World's religions.  Many Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they may miss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000 years ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewish people of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said that John the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)  Later in prison John even questioned who Jesus was: \\\"is he the one who is to come or do we look for another\\\". (see book of Matthew)   David Koresh didn't even come close.  The problem is that people like this make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real Messiah when he does show up.   Very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for Christians: How to recognize the Second Coming?  The Messiah should not claim to be God.  What sets a Messiah apart is that he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect but achieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were born sinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take God thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God originally intended.  God's restoration providence is still not complete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, God's representative on the earth, but not God himself.  There is only one God.  ...

I played Elvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally made a very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel is roughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time fighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games, especially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to stay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This  is not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is quite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found that is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting strategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is  no fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain moderately challanging puzzles.  The really interesting thing about this game is that it is really  broken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits you must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transported with no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits traps you inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must  escape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines and pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant zombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue some humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is perhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into Jack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper victim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and  meet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to  stop the almost indestructible zombies.    Over all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a  creepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game. I heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.     *********************************************************  - All prices include shipping. - All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated. - US buyers only please. - All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,   priority USPS. - All games include all original materials including box, manual,   disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.

Here are the relevent calls:  main_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),                 myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,                 main_win.line_thick, fg, bg); XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, main_win.text,                 main_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint); main_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, main_win.win, 0, 0); XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win); XMapSubwindows (mydisplay, main_win.win); The event mask for main_win is:         PPosition | PSize | StructureNotifyMask | ExposureMask| KeyPressMask |         EnterWindowMask | LeaveWindowMask; The flags are         PPosition | PSize  I then create detail_win.win with the following calls (hints has new values): detail_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),                 myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,                 detail_win.line_thick, fg, bg); XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, detail_win.text,                 detail_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint); detail_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, detail_win.win, 0, 0); XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win); Event Mask and flags are identical to main_win's flags and event mask.

The dinner was instigated by the aunt of the hostess, whom I had met while visiting my wife in Galveston last October.  The dear old aunt (now  deceased) was very proud of her Jewish heritage, although not especially devout.  Her parents were both murdered in Nazi concentration camps in Austria during WWII because they were Jewish.  While conversing with her about politics, world affairs and religion, she remarked that it would  be a good idea for me to visit her niece on my return to Atlanta.  Within two days of returning to Atlanta, her niece called to invite me over for dinner with her husband.  I went, not knowing really what to expect, other than stimulating conversation and fellowship.  What I got, however, was rather unexpected.  The thrust of the evening's discussion was to condemn the Reagan-Bush policies prohibiting abortion counseling  in federally funded family planning clinics, prohibiting the sterilization of minorities on welfare here and in Puerto Rico, on the ban on fetal tissue research, and against the Mexico City policy, \\\"which denies U.S. foreign aid to programs overseas that promote abortion.\\\"  The crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of \\\"overpopulation,\\\" rampant domestic crime, African starvation, unwed mothers, etc., on Christianity, rather on the fall of Adam.  Now, this is not what I had to come to talk about.  But every time I tried to  bring up the subject of Judaism, they would condemn Jews for Jesus and admonish me against converting to Judaism, \\\"because it involves too much study and effort.\\\"  And I did not even raise the prospect, nor try to convert them to the truth of Christ!  There was certainly no Jewish proselytism going on there.  And again, last November I toured a \\\"traditional\\\" Jewish synagogue and was subjected to a 30-minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity in general.  I realize that these are two isolated incidents, and that the best supervisor I ever had at work is Jewish, but from my experience, the modern Jew is not known for his proselytism.    --  boundary\",\"# # \\\"labor\\\" is a tough one.

Questions to Israelis   To:  shaig@Think.COM  Subject: Ten questions to Israelis  Dear Shai,  Your answers to my questions are unsatisfactory.  In the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence of Israeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information I have received from other quarters, according to which there are two distinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship (Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passports etc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all times and present them at many public places, almost every day. These ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab. You maintain that this mainly because of religious services provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ? Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it serves no other purpose ?  In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was established, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).  Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public official. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to Vanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.  Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning 'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from Ma'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?  You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been used by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet Union into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they would not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be very happy if you could convince me that what I am told about Israel were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so. I suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.\",\" From the limited details released so far, It seems that the clipper chip  system must employ some sort of public key cryptography. Otherwise, the key  management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system  unworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place at the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in  their data base?  This means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key  algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is  rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the feds are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that  could break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.     As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to ban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. Their contention that they  need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likely is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont  have the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q&A session, they talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed. They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without  court order even though tapping a phone line requires one. Also pick up on  their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we'll ban strong crypto outright? I dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all (legal) ways possible.\",\"Dear folks,  I am still awaiting for some sensible answer and comment.  It is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normal civlized life. They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967 without civil and political rights.   It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country, Palestine. Gaza is not a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreign country for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians are concerned and as far as common sense has it.   It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens and the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists will begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same rights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.  Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel is entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should be entitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel to enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master and slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.  To close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistence and means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a crime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss  to which Israeli society has degraded.   I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain why Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return and live there ? Would they be allowed to, if they converted to Judaism ? Is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their religion or ethnic origin ? Please give an honest answer.\",\" All they said on the radio that he developed stiffness in the shoulder after throwing a curveball that didn't loosen.

Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question, because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000.  Basically, there are a number of functions with prototypes set up in, let's say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the composite widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type :   typedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget)  but in several places in the HP source code, they reference the insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just one, as the prototype suggests.  For example:   (*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args)  Now, GCC chokes on this, giving an error message that too many arguments are passed to the function.  So, does anyone have any suggestions as to how to turn off this checking in GCC, or how I can go about changing the code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h, or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions.  Many thanks in advance for any help. \",\" We tried to ship an X server once that only supported a 24bit TrueColor visual. The main problems we encountered were:   1) Clients written with logic like the following:       if (DefaultDepth() != 1)   /* Assume default depth is 8bit */      These clients need an 8bit deep visual in the root window     to run correctly.   2) Other clients didn't even bother to do that much, and just     outright assumed they had a *dynamic* visual class, with a     dynamic colormap. XStoreColors doesn't work on cmaps     associated with Static or TrueColor visual classes, but     many clients don't bother to check, they just start     throwing XStoreColor calls at you.  Though both are clearly client error, this is the case with so many clients that it's easier for you to expose 8bit PseudoColor as a default root window visual, than it ever would be for all these client writers to change their clients to do the right thing. --\",\"    You need to hop over to talk.politics.misc.

I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published  solutions to it.   The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the  edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw  the object we   1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively  computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the         curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume  that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not  exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable  measure. 2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment  of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two  triangles which will be filled in to color the surface. 3) Depth sort the triangles 4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw  and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is  along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge  colored with a special \\\"edge color\\\"   It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface. The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated. They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area.\",\"I have posted the logos of the NL East teams to alt.binaries.pictures.misc   Hopefully, I'll finish the series up next week with the NL West.

The jealousy does not technically exist until the object is apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there even though it is not detectable.  Your description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven't attempted to define the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of each Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a similar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is easy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I misunderstood?   My p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and his writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do my bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth) is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this will probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the list of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element may come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his transactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.  I've had some more thoughts on my definitions:  I've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of the Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a graphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of frequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the spectrum over time.  Conscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature because Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often unwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given time which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with Freud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the urges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego, I suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is \\\"what provides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?\\\". I think I need some more time with this one.  That's about it for now!

Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies seize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.  WE have to take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create laws and rules only to better their positions within the government.  WE have allowed them to take too much power from the people of this nation.  That situation has to be changed.  Allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off drug informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact with the Devil himself.  It's a vicious cycle.  The law enforcement agencies are motivated to seize property to fund their own activities.  And having no easy way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more incentive for the agencies to take property.  It's also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that Clinton would have the \\\"plumbers\\\" out in force shortly.  Clinton and his henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control.  Anytime a leader believes in that, the leader will use every means possible to retain that control and take more.  WE have to take OUR government back.  Otherwise we will end up living in the equivalent of a high-tech third world dictatorship.  We have to take responsibility for ourselves, our personal welfare, and our actions.\",\"The primary problem in human nature is a \\\"fragmentation of being.\\\" Humans are in a state of tension, a tension of opposites. Good and evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.  The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of being. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's rebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of the Scriptures.  Man was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words of St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, this is called \\\"theosis,\\\" or \\\"deification.\\\"  One can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul, and body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs was a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the Creator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God, their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly irreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in their lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.  The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it were to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil, its paradisiac state would also be destroyed.  Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of innocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining of self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His masterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?  God must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral value, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There is no other way to achieve union with God.  Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities. He was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites, and making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God, not in His essence, but in His energies.  The opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the answer to his dilemma in vs 25.\",\" No problem, no offence taken ...

[It will encourage the *FBI* to commit (even more) criminal acts, but that's not the point here.]  But this gives another avenue of attack on the Clipper proposal.  When the EFF/ACLU/CPSR FOIA requests are made, they should ask for details on the bureaucratic and equipment infrastructure that is proposed (or  even already budgeted) for the FBI to service tapping requests -- for now and the projected future.   From these figures, estimate the number of Clipper-tap requests the FBI is expecting.  Publish this figure.  Compare it on a per-capita basis with the amount of tapping now known or suspected.  Also estimate how expensive it would be for the FBI to install more Clipper-tapping stations, and how rapidly they could be built and installed ... ie, get the \\\"plus or minus\\\" epsilon for the near future.  Might be a mite disturbing for J. Q. Public to know these things.  And despite all the technical details [BTW, thanks to those who've been providing them!], we still don't know   1) how the tapping requests will be transmitted and authenticated (though    it isn't too hard to guess a good scheme).  2) how the results will be securely transmitted (Fed Ex the audio tapes?)  3) how privacy will be re-established when an investigation is complete.\",\"# #I have a question regarding the processing of program arguments #such as the -geometry option.

I can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned, they are adjusted to \\\"factory-spec\\\" before leaving the central USA distribution point (MA) for the eastern Canadian market. Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that the >=15\\\" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over distances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore *expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor* (not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN Information Systems in Toronto) before sale.

His equivalent average started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. So let us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 level of play.  That is good. Very good, in fact.

He was quite far down on the depth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on the team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decent numbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league oblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli. I think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.  As for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilers dumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) or even Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn't far off.  --  Andrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.com HP IDACOM Telecom Division      | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253\",\"cd's for sale:  1. jon bon jovi - new jersey      $8.00 2. boomerang    - soundtrack      $8.00 3. the police   - every breath you take  $8.00   */ $1.00 s/h \",\"The trackbal on my PB140 no longer moves in the horizontal direction.

The way they were used at that time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched a complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It would be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league. Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1 through October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games than the other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that stretch. \",\" Yeah, I'm sure that our lab would love a ride (he's the type that sticks his head out car windows) but I didn't think that he would enjoy being bungee- corded to the gas tank, and 65 lbs or squirming beast is a bit much for a backpack (ok who's done it....).\",\": Marian CATHOLIC high school, outside of chicago: :  : 666 south ASHLAND avenue. :  Actually, Satanism is technically inverted Catholicism. \",\"Thus said djb@silverton.berkeley.edu (D.

You will see the floppy disk and     hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static     precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do     this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back  of the mac.   3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the     tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.     The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the     tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may     also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power     supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you     need release.   4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon     SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable     leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.     The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed     to release it.                                              5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount  6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A     phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop     it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful     here.  7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the     right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding  posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then  lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.  8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM     slots.  9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to     gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their  chips facing the front of the motherboard.       The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in  sets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely  and firmly into a fully upright position.   10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the     tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about  1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into  place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.     Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks     into place.   11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY     DRIVE CABLE.  12) Replace the phillips head screw  13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.  14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount\",\"I would like to sell my Logitech Hand-held 256 Gray Scale Scanner.

Opening statements were given by both the prosecution and the defense, each side presenting its version of what happenned last August.  The prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to Idaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the \\\"evil\\\" federal government.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal agents \\\"sawed off\\\" shotguns and later failed to appear for trial: Despite repeated \\\"good faith\\\" efforts to get Weaver to surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted when Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and began firing.  According to the prosecution, three people were taking an \\\"offensive action\\\" against an FBI helicopter when an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.  The defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern Idaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted simply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to sell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution alleged, want to become a \\\"regular supplier\\\").  The defense also argued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when he wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly, but I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist angle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  The failure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given an incorrect court date and then indicted before that date. The shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed Weaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son, Samuel.  Weaver then fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal agent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found, there were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic: However, agents were near the body for an extended period of time and could have played with the select-fire - this will have to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims that Vicki Weaver was only going to \\\"look at the body\\\" [not recover?] of her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.  Prosecution quote: \\\"Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made that confrontation.\\\" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist  Defense quote: \\\"The evidence in this case is going to show that this is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged with crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes that the government did commit.\\\"  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]  Notes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters heeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protests outside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate again had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including \\\"Tim\\\" again.  \\\"Tim\\\" claimed he was a skinhead, who were \\\"ordinary, working class people.\\\"  He also claimed he was for \\\"white pride, not white power.\\\"  Outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview with Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly what the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.  In an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about a dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the courthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence in action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some tidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent were volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they believed in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement, repeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the defendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the recounting of his wife's death), and Spence compared the \\\"sawed off\\\" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another good one!).  Today (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to begin presenting evidence.  Drew =============================================================  \",\" How long ago was this?

My comments are based primarily on William Rusch's historical summary in \\\"The Trinitarian Controversy\\\", Fortress.  I'm going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh]  MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY   [SECOND CENTURY  The writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much of the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides, Athenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the \\\"Apologists\\\".  Their theology has often been described as \\\"Logos theology\\\".  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less a two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with the Father, as his mind or thought.  This \\\"immanent Word\\\" became \\\"expressed\\\" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus. Thus Jesus' full distinction from the Father only became visible in history, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity. Rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the final orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated, because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with the eternal plurality in the Godhead.  Irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However he was uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God as one personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible except through his process of self-revelation (the \\\"economy\\\").  The distinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasized the Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus' views should probably be called \\\"economic trinitarianism\\\", though that term is normally used (as below) to refer to later developments.   THIRD CENTURY  --clh]  Dynamic Monarchianism   Source: Theodotus Adherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern Unitarians Perception of God's Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature and oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are consubstantial with the Father's divine essence only as impersonal attributes. The divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict sense of the word. Perception of God's Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable impossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The 'diversity' of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the work of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to a hypostatic union. Asignation of Deity/Eternality:  Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, and without beginning or end.  Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present in a unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified.  Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternality is ascribed to the Holy Spirit. Criticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation concerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the Holy Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical doctrine of salvation. [In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism at all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seen as simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the Church.  --clh]    Modalistic Monarchianism   Source: Praxeas Adherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals (Jesus Only) Perception of God's Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He is qualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  This essence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The three names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself. Perception of God's Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous and confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God's modalistic manifesting of himself. The paradox of a subsisting \\\"three in oneness\\\" is refuted by recognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different names and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama. Asignation of Deity/Eternality:  Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of the only unique and unitary God  Son: Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another mode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God manifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation).  Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the one God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of regeneration and sanctification. Criticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian deficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its concept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such simultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ's baptism. [Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There are actually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and his followers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme. Sabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic Trinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately, information about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there seems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh]   [I've moved the following description to be with the other third-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh]  \\\"Economic\\\" Trinitarianism   Source: Hippolytus, Tertullian Adherents: Various \\\"neo-economic\\\" Trinitarians Perception of God's Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical, indivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially comprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption. Perception of God's Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated by means of such terms as \\\"distinction\\\" and \\\"distribution\\\" dispelling effectively the notion of separateness or division. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: The equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in observation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the Godhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this ambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication. Criticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the relational aspect of the Trinity. [Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as mentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in the various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However they did say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow present in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in substance.  Many people regard this view as being essentially orthodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh]  [Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted to apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the terms of the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a mediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality of creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is \\\"eternally generated\\\".  That is, the relationship between Father and Son is eternal.  It cannot be said that \\\"there was once when he was not\\\" (a phrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Son is intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are described as separate \\\"hypostases\\\", though this may not have quite the meaning of separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union is one of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may have used the term homoousios (\\\"of the same substance\\\").  The Holy Spirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father through the Son.  Origen's intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but he pushes things in the direction of separateness.   FOURTH CENTURY  --clh]  Subordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh]   Source: Arius Major Adherents: Modern Jehovah's Witnesses, and several other lesser known cults Perception of God's Essence: The inherent oneness of God's nature is properly identifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet entities who do not share the divine essence. Perception of God's Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes the concept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. \\\"Threeness in oneness\\\" is self- contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God. Asignation of Deity/Eternality:  Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning.  Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated, he is not of the divine essence.  Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewed as an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him. Criticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting the deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise asserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ, and the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology. [Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully human either.  He is supernatural and sinless.  That distinguishes this view from adoptionism.  --clh]   Orthodox Trinitarianism   Source: Athanasius Adherents: Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Contemporary orthodox Christianity Perception of God's Essence: God's being is perfectly unified and simplex: of one essence.  This essence of deity is held in common by Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The three persons are consubstantial, coinherent, co-equal, and co- eternal. Perception of God's Subsistence: The divine subsistence is said to occur in three modes of being or hypostases. As such, the Godhead exists \\\"undivided in divided persons.\\\" This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation in function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: In its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both the divine essence and function. Criticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in human language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the ineffable mystery of \\\"three in oneness.\\\" [At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all of which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which are somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respond to Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen's thought a bit too far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In general the East tended to take an approach based on Origen's, and it was hard to get acceptance of Nicea in the East.  Its final acceptance was based on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians: Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory of Nazianzus, among others.  While starting with three, they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one must think of them as being a single God.  This allowed the Council of Constantinople, in 381, to get wide agreement on the idea of three hypostatese and one ousia.  --clh]  Adapted from _Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine_, by H.

That's especially true for sci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since the traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.  I'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my followup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your feelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an 80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less acceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one repository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper would need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out in this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search. A slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number, and then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys, neither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant to attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect the subkeys even more.  Other thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of the databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be their back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories' public keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session keys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This would answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you make sure they stop''.  We can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back door -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record of the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of the warrant.  I can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100 public key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need more keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be used to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant; the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very long.  I suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from the obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the back door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned about foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard rumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with DES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it was much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping the details secret so that others don't build their own implementations without the back door.\",\"# 74S Later modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in #  power consumption.

Currently I have   8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.   both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking   of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know   that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I   can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about   $400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,   the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that   the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather   avoid...  So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work   well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about   $90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how   do they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the   extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the   ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so   probably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly   appreciated.  -Eric\",\"Personally, I follow the no alcohol rule when I'm on a bike.

As per request of Hasan:  From _The Revolt_, by Menachem Begin, Dell Publishing, NY, 1977:  [pp. 225-227]      \\\"Apart from the military aspect, there is a moral aspect to the story of Dir Yassin. At that village, whose name was publicized throughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had four killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the battle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women, children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the slopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw away the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own risk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent testimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable casualties.      \\\"The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].      \\\"In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr. Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal superciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of 'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'      \\\"The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the result it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel. Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the Haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting. Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main road; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the Haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the rest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even before they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir Yassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the conquest of Haifa.\\\"   [1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) \\\"To counteract the loss of Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish officials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of evil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at the mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen battalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lie is still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.\\\"\",\"I'm looking for a Sharp 6220 or TI Travelmate 2000 for parts.

You're missing a central teaching of Christianity - man is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing that, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all who consider themselves \\\"christians\\\" are (even those who manage to head their own \\\"churches\\\").  \\\"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.\\\" - Matt. 7:21.   Again, what historical documents do you trust?  Do you think Hannibal crossed the Alps?  How do you know?  How do you know for sure?  What historical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis- credit it as well as the Bible has?   Well, it's really a shame you feel this way.  No one can browbeat you into believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving you further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions: 1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain it.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this salvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain modern offshoots like the \\\"new age movement\\\" teach or does he require God's help?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such help come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for some people it did comprise their life's writings, so I am hardly in a position to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few, of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me). The spritual life is a difficult journey (if you've never read \\\"A Pilgrim's Progress,\\\" I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).   Now I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a conflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You wrote that \\\"I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most of the teachings of christ\\\".  Well, Christ referred to God as \\\"My Father\\\", not \\\"My Mother\\\", and while the \\\"maleness\\\" of God is not the same as the maleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not honor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory, or politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women -  english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human population.

Is it half-duplex or truly one way?  I'm guessing half-duplex     since the host can turn LEDs on and off. 3.

When a friend of mine went shopping for a small sedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so the salespeople wouldn't give her the \\\"bimbo\\\" treatment. Her first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan Sentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what \\\"we\\\" wanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid kept playing the \\\"let me run this price by the sales manager\\\".  After playing the \\\"good salesman, bad salesman\\\" game, we finally told him that if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps we should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick in the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's \\\"Don't Get Taken Every Time\\\" for a list.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of \\\"you'll have to work with us on this price\\\", also known as \\\"each time you come up a thousand dollars we'll come down ten\\\", the salesmanager gave a signal to his two sales cronies, stood up, and said \\\"well, we can't come down any more so I guess we can't help you\\\" and they trouped out of the room, leaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm. I'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and I mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the door.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on the desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman, and began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few sentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line (!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call another dealership from \\\"his\\\" phone!  I said that since he'd announced that our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our voices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone, anyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom. Sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he begins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore, we're going next door to the Nissan dealership.  Then comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out the front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom, customers and all, \\\"Go ahead!

Lets begin by saying that its whole rear end was definately Hawk 650.  Additionally, it had a CBR900RR style tank, full fairing, and only a tach.  Now, at first I thought it was an 'RC31' (a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing), but I did not think that they made this huge tank for it.  Additionally, the gauges were certainly not from a Hawk.  They looked much more like  900RR gauges.  Overall, the bike looked like a 900RR except for the rear single-sided swingarm and wheel (there were straight from the Hawk)  So, what did I see?

I followed the instructions for returning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks.  Well, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which were ever returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me \\\"Why we never received your old chips.\\\"  I then explained I the procedure that I had followed to return them, to which the person replied \\\"You mean you sent them US Mail?\\\" (which I had, per the original sales person's instructions.)  I was told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that I should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly what I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were absolutely no help.

So rewiring is still a part of this job, however, the ground may be connected to a local earth ground, rather than back at the breaker box.  As Jamie said, GFCI devices are required by code in a number of places, most notably: bathrooms, and outside the house.  I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets, rather than the breakers.  You will end up with much less headaches.  Noise pickup in long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.  GFCI devices do save lives, if you decide to install them, be sure to check them regularly (using the test button).

If you don't want to hear the transient, use some other device (a photoresistor-output optoisolator is the usual sort of thing) to gently MUTE the signal, then switch, THEN remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator.   It used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors in switching audio, because the photoresistor time delay (a few thousandths of a second) kept any noise in the digital side (which drives the lamp) from contaminating the audio.

I need a motor, but will buy a whole bike.  email replies to: David.Braun@FtCollinsCO.NCR.com  or:  dab@vuse.vanderbilt.edu\",\"    As far as I can see, one of the big differences between Davidians and Christians is in who they follow.  I have sometimes tried to put myself in the feet of one of Jesus's disciples.  Basically, they gave up a lot --- career, possibly family, and well, a whole bunch, to follow Jesus.  So what is the difference?  It is quite plain.  Jesus was good and David Koresh was not.  The problem is, I think, is that we try to legislate what is good and what is bad in terms of principles.  For instance, there are thousands of  laws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not.  Often, it is hard to bring people to justice, because it is not possible to find a legal way to do it.  If only we could trust judges to be just, then we could tell them to administer justice fairly, and justice would be followed.  But since judges don't always get it right, we have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches of other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect (the justice of man) into something perfect.  But what I hear about the justice system in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true.  There is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation more than the material being presented.  So we might consider  a ranting Christian to be bad, but an eloquent person from another religion to be good.  This goes along with the American desire to protect the Constitution at all costs, even if it allows people to do bad things.   I think that it is the message that is important.  If a man is presenting a false message, even if he is ever ever so mild mannered, then that man is performing a tremendous disservice.  I know that I am rambling here.  I guess that what I am trying to say is that we shouldn't be looking for principles that tell us why the Davidians got it wrong.  It is not wrong to follow and worship a person.  But it is important to choose the right person. It is simple.  Choose Jesus, and you got it right.  Choose anyone else, and you got it wrong.  Why?  Because Jesus is the begotten son of God, and nobody else is.  Jesus was without sin, and nobody else was.\",\"    Final Solution for the Gaza ghetto ?    ------------------------------------     While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto, they    repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and    attempt to starve the Gazans.

The Jews in the Warsaw ghetto were fighting to keep themselves and their families from being sent to Nazi gas chambers. Groups like Hamas and the Islamic Jihad fight with the expressed purpose of driving all Jews into the sea. Perhaps, we should persuade Jewish people to help these wnderful \\\"freedom fighters\\\" attain this ultimate goal.  Maybe the \\\"freedom fighters\\\" will choose to spare the co-operative Jews.

The numbers comparing hundreds of thousands (indeed, even a million) of instances of law abiding citizens deterring criminal activity, seem valid to me.  Likewise the number of gun-caused homicides each year (about 11,000/year?).  However, it is surprising that the \\\"Evil AntiGun Empire \\\" (Darth Vader breathing sound effect here) never tries to compare \\\"All legitimate gun defenses\\\" vs. \\\"All gun crimes.\\\"  Instead,  it's always \\\"All legitimate gun defenses,\\\"  which includes cases in which the criminals are shot but not killed, and cases in which the criminal is not here, vs. just  criminal gun homicides, which only includes case sin which the victim died.

The backup catcher postion will be a showdown between Tackett and Parent although I would prefer Parent. #1 Draft Pick Jeff Hammonds may be coming up faster in the O's hierarchy of the minors faster than expected. Mike Flanagan is trying for another comeback. Big Ben is being defended by coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot, most came in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half. This may be Ben's year.   I feel that while this may not be Mussina's Cy Young year, he will be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year around August. I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the O's need. Orsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defense better and play like he did in '91. The O's right now don't have many left-handed hitters. Anderson proving last year was no fluke and Cal's return to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. The  rotation should be Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, ?????. Olson is an interesting case. Will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get three pop outs? You never know.

I would suggest that you take your code, and submit it to comp.sys.mac.binaries to be distributed (including to the ftp sites).  Many folks, myself included, would enjoy the extra code.   Just to clarify, the 3D routines that are mentioned in various places on the mac are in a libray, not the ROM of the mac.  A few years ago before I knew anything about implementing graphics, I came across a demo of the Apple GrafSys3D library and it actually did a lot.  However, it is quite limited in the sense that it's a low-level 3D library; your code still has to plot individual points, draw each line, etc ad nauseum.  It has nothing on GL, for example, where you can handle objects.  Other things to consider when talking about Apple's old 3D GrafSys library:  * Unsupported;  never was and no plans exist to do so in the future  * Undocumented; unless you call header files documentation...

If the DRAM produces an error, or a registers cannot be read from a device, or the device corrupts that address/data or control paths, then if it is possible, the firmware branchs to another sound routine that produces the  'sad mac' sound.

I just thought of another one, in the Bible, so it's definately not because of *lack* of religion.  The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for other reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy and peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions  lying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice, peaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to mind...  I agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally intended for.  That doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in the Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own stomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to kill by their leaders.  The point is that there are many things involved in religion that often lead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant side effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching between Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.    @Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest parts of Man's history.@  Atheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological social caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs. The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to further their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these were groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more powerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples because there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over religion that he does not have many choices.

I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience can be trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something so materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess anything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we were discussing the \\\"mind\\\" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal, as it were; and half spiritual.   ?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the ?possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do ?not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of ?Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage ?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know ?that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This ?is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,           Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.   ?Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain ?of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they ?cannot be certain.  This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation. Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas not subject to the experimental method.   ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ?\\\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some ?

He is trying to explain the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption of Mary.]   If this is true than why in the Genesis story is God concerned that Adam and Eve might also eat from the Tree of Life and live forever and be like gods?  Eating of the tree of life would not take away the effects of eating of the Tree of Knowledge.  Is there any reason to assume that they had already eaten of the Tree of Life and so had already attained to eternal life?  If so, what basis is there for saying that this was taken away from them?

I was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist, so I have stated this Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about 18.  For some reason, I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the resurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean the raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:  1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was  pretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right now.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the \\\"great judgement\\\" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day). I was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the church -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my \\\"soul\\\" (which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?  2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms  that my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My physical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal so it can be tortured for all eternity?  3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical place to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth? Do you think we could find it if we dig?  Mark Schnitzius schnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.edu Univ. of Central Florida  [There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I think the most common view is that final disposition does not occur until a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the meantime, some believe that people \\\"sleep\\\" until the final resurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death to the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe that souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then. There are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.  The new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a different \\\"technology\\\" than the current one, one which is not mortal. (Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus' resurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not subject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other, but I don't think most people claim to know the details.  I don't think I'd say it's the same atoms.  I'd assume there would be some analog of a physical place, but I wouldn't expect to find it under the earth or up in the sky.  I'd suspect that it's in another dimension, outside this physical world, or whatever.  But again, we have little in the way of details.\",\"  They exist.  Even photosynthetic varieties.

The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.    Contents:  * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key? * What references can I start with to learn cryptology? * How does one go about cryptanalysis? * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance? * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem? * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice? * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are   relatively easy to break?   * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?    The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted   acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A   by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone   who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.    A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so   that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is   the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art   of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when   you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both   cryptography and cryptanalysis.    The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is   called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert   plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert   ciphertext into plaintext.    A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The   algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,   Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different   values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.    The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are   called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,   eavesdroppers, or third parties.  * What references can I start with to learn cryptology?    For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given   in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,   concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,   these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has   developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and   mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is   encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up   to the mid-60's.    Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or   Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want   to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common   mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.    The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of   many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently   several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The   book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range   of security including encryption algorithms, database security,   access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments   apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].    The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite   technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in   the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of   DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses   of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on   modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management   and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and   networks.    The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on   the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.  * How does one go about cryptanalysis?    Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of   analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern   finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available   textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series   [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for   the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given   systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the   cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still   classified.    Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,   or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare   of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the   most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.  * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?    In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can   find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.    Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding   ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the   plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or   decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.   Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this   brute-force search is impractical.        Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered   practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years   now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with   this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the   mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic   decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel   machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.   Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].    One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a   brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.  * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?    The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key   rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.    A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The   unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of   ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and   if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount   of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is   probably strong.    A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears   random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).        A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A   system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.    If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily   strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.   However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is   strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then   he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring   integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.  * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?    Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical   cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your   ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might   assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is   correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the   rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same   plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus   he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he   doesn't have a chance.    Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,   for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even   chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into   the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See   [KAH67].    * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are   relatively easy to break?\",\" A traffic citation is an accusation of having committed a crime. That's why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you want one, you are still innocent until proven guilty.  Cops are not the only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes, anyone who witnesses a crime can do so.  Go to the Highway Patrol and explain the situation, give them a description of the car and the license number, and tell them the specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute (ie, search the Vehicle Code and have the section number handy).  Fill out the ticket and sign it.  It will go through the same system any ticket a cop writes goes through.  If contested, you will have to appear in court to prosecute.  Your word will not carry the same weight as a cop's. \",\"    I agree with you. \",\"      It's not the NRA's fault; but it is something to consider if you are considering contributing to the NRA.

I've generally been able to get fonts to work by setting OutlineThreshold=160.  Depending on your printer resolution and the point size you are using, you may need a different value.  The Windows Resource Kit warns against going above 300.  Presumably, that might cause fonts to print as square boxes or something.  :-|  (I'm not smiling.)

Yes, a point well-taken ... however, even in areas that finally got some games, there's something nagging in the back of your skull when the network that has the national rights in its pocket says on

From today's Times, ABC got great ratings in Chicago and St. Louis (a 4.2), and the Kings-Flames got a 2.9 on the West Coast, but only a 2.2 in metro New York (i.e., the Devils squandered their newfound support from a year ago when they played the Rangers )-;).

Turned out  that the actual reading should have been 160K. Court case followed because lady said she wouldn't have bought a car with that much km's. Dealer found  quilty, fined and had to take back the car.  I think you have a case if you can get a sworn statement from the previous owner. Take the car back to the dealer and threaten him or something.\",\" Personally, I think Jeffy-Poo was still smarting more from the third degree burns he suffered after April 1st last year rather than the supposed burns that he suffered in \\\"the joke\\\".  Granted I was one of those people that were taken in by it and I was certainly concerned...and then pissed at him for  pulling such a thing (which I made known to him).

Yes, I understand the issues.  I don't even particularly care for the idea.  But am I the only one that finds the sort of overreaction above just a *little* questionable?  You must find things like the Moon *really* obnoxious in their pollution.  A few questions for those frothing at the mouth to ask themselves:   1) How long is this thing supposed to stay up?  Sounds like it would have a *huge* drag area, not a lot of mass, and be in a fairly low orbit.   2) Just what orbital parameters are we talking about here? What real impact are we talking about, really?  How many optical astronomers are *really* going to be impacted?   3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of 'seeing' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data the sensors are supposed to return along with the data for large inflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)? The choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising is being used to help fund this thing.   4) If your answer to 3) above was \\\"the astronomers\\\", then feel free to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more important research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.  In other words, put up or shut up.   Probably so.  I'm just not sure we agree about who the 'stupid' are.    Yeah, me too.  --  \\\"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live  in the real world.\\\"   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden\",\" It means that the EFF's public stance is complicated with issues irrelevant to the encryption issue per se. There may well be people who care about the encryption issue who don't care to associate themselves with the network erotica issue (or may even disagree with the EFF's position).\",\" I must respectfully disagree with this assertion, Brad.

Read \\\"DEA is Not Adequately Protecting National Security Information\\\" [GAO/IMTEC 92-31] for an excellent example of what I'm talking about.

I believe that the escrow organizations will be penetrated by foreign intelligence services within months, if not weeks, of their selection.  Private organizations that lack the resources of a full-fleged intelligence service will take longer - perhaps on the order of one to two years.  Nonetheless, the penetrations will take place, without question.\",\"Well Bruins fans it's playoff time again. It looks like the B's have peaked at the right time. Getting out of the Adams is going to be a cat fight to the end. After what they did to Montreal and Quebec, these teams will be out for revenge. If Neely can stay healthy, and both Bourque and Moog stay sharp, we should get to see Neely finally take out two years of frustration  on Ulf (I don't fight) Samuelson. I don't agree with fighting in the NHL, but if there is one guy who deserves to be taken out good, it's him.  This is going to be a good series, Go Bruins!!!! \",\"  Yes, this is certainly one of the traditional ideas about the Mithraic cult (although not the only one.)  It had many elements that seem to have been borrowed by Catholicism (e.g. the Mass, communion, the sharing of a sacred meal, consecration of bread and wine, etc.)  For quite an amusing novel that uses this same idea, check out:  The Covenant of the Flame by David Morrell.  It has some quite interesting occult bits, and lots of killing.

Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a major way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver (I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something).  I wasn't too fussed about this until I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I now find that the audio-mode will not work.  I assume it is not being handled correctly by the ASW-410 driver.  So, should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade?  If so does anyone know their FAX number?  Any assistance appreciated.

It's my bet the big magazines - Byte, Scientific American, et all - will be ready to run with a pre-written government-slanted story on this in the next issue.  ('Just keep us some pages spare boys, we'll give you the copy in time for the presses')  We *must* get big names in the industry to write well argued pieces against this proposal (can you call it that when it's a de facto announcement?) and get them into the big magazines before too much damage is done.  It would be well worth folks archiving all the discussions from here since the day of the announcement to keep all the arguments at our fingertips.

No, he wasn't always spot on top of the play, and he wasn't overly cute, but those pipes!  That lusty, barrel chested, voice! No pipsqueak was he (unlike some fellas we know!)  I rode into hockey mania on the coattails of Gretzky and the Boys on the Bus.  My first Finals saw the Islanders sweep them.  But I'll never forget the night, a year later, when the Oilers closed it out at home in the pandemonium, the smoke from a million sparklers, the long empty-net goal near the end, and Dan Kelly letting the crowd's reaction tell the story for a few long seconds, then that voice barking through the din \\\"Dave Lumley ... sews it up for Edmonton!\\\"  It sounds stupid, but that early (for me) hockey memory will always bring a thrill.  Since then I've grown a lot more jaded about the game, but I was really saddened by Dan Kelly's passing.

Unfortunately, too often the prize is limited and the efficacy of the 'cure' questionable when applied to all sufferers.  This applies to both medical researchers and non-medical individuals. Just because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some use does not make the next cure-all. What about the dozens of individuals who have courageously participated in clinical trials? Did they have any guarentee of cures? Are they any less because they didn't trumpet their story all over the world?  As a parting note, wasn't there some studies done on Gingko seeds for Meniere's? (To the original poster : what about trying for a trial of that? It's probably not a final answer but it certainly may alleviate some of the discomfort. And you'd be helping answer the question for future sufferers.)\",\"     I had the same problem.  At first, I thought it was the video driver and    made sure I had the most current drivers, because the problem was most   evident at SVGA resolution modes.  It didn't help and after a bit of   experimentation, determined that the problem existed in standard VGA   resolution mode. It was just much less noticeable.      My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in 1990. It   worked just fine in DOS and DOS based graphic applications.  On the    guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse, I borrowed   a new mouse (a MS bus model) and tried it.  That solved the problem.   So, if your mouse is old, you may want to try replacing it for a newer   one.      --  signoff\",\"Dragon's Lair II ($400 Complete) -------------------------------------       or       $220 Laser Disc    $150 Motherboard/Joystick/buttons    $35  Graphics (For arcade cabinet)    $50  Brick Power Supply +12/-12/+5     Space Ace ($430 Complete) --------------------------------------     or       $250 Laser Disc    $150 Motherboard/Joystick/buttons    $35  Graphics (For arcade cabinet)    $50  Brick Power Supply +12/-12/+5           Both Space Ace and Dragon's Lair II ($750) -----------------------------------------------      These games require a Sony 1450 Laserdisc player.  The nice thing about this player is that you can also watch normal Laserdisc movies on it as well.  I have one which I will sell for $600 by itself, $550 with a purchase of one complete system or $500 if you buy both systems.       I currently run this into my entertainment center.  I have it housed in a PC computer case with with its own fan, and  power supply.  I run the audio into my stereo system, and the laserdisc runs directly into the T.V..  I have made a mount for the joysticks and the buttons.  First person who buys both games will get it all, otherwise you have to do it yourself.       If you would prefer to have it all housed in a normal arcade cabinet this can be done as well.  The graphics will go nicely along the sides and front of the cabinet.       Everything works perfectly.  The laserdisc player has an RS-232 port which you can use to develop your own multimedia type applications.  The Laserdiscs have been stored in a safe place and have no scratches on them.       If you are interested please email me.

It fails for several reasons :  1) You have edited out the context of the action under discussion.  2) I never brought the legal definition up. I use the English language and not the legal dialect. The legal definition of fraud changes from one country to another in any case. The context of the discussion is morality of censorship.     You are extrapolating from the statement I made concerning a circumstance in which such an act of censorship would be permissable to the Teel case. If you had bothered to read the post instead of trying to prove how stupid you thought me you would have done rather better. The mode of argument I was using was a form of rhetoric. Argument by example, I describe a wide set of circumstances in which an action is permisable and demonstrate that they do not apply, thus the action is not permisable.  Obviously a company posting from a University adress would be squashed,  it would be contrary to the internet comercial use.   Now you are clutching at straws. In the context of the discussion it was the fact of association between the company and the post that was important. The typeface etc is inconsequential.    If you are implying that I am lying I suggest you read Mark Holohan and Ulick Staffords posts into soc.culture.british. If you are suggesting that  advocating murder is a trivial matter I would prefer that you state it directly.   Certainly I oppose the right of Dr Sidiqui and the Ayatolah Khomenhi to call for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Incitement to murder is not part of what I consider legitimate freedom of speech.    That is irrelevant, the case is not the incremental cost but the facility cost. If I decide that a company I am associated with should subscribe to USEnet that usenet connection is the property of the company. It is quite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and regulate the use of its property in accordance with its policy. For example if a Microsoft employee were to post \\\"Windows NT is crap don't buy it\\\" from a Microsoft machine I would consider it reasonable for Microsoft to sack that employee. In the same way if a company decides that it has  political objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political manner. This is no worse than Rupert Murdoch using his papers as a political platform for his views.    ah yes you did not quote them, merely refered to them.    Your article consisted of a reference to the first ammendment, your signature and pretty well damn all else.     Are you refering to the initial hearings on an injunction or the judgments on the substantive case?  The initial hearings that the government won were judged on the not unresonable judgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be harmed would be grounds for prior restraint. The second set of hearings on the substance judged that the government had no case and that the official secrets act could not be used to suppress information in thwe public domain already. The part that they won was over the copyright issue which is rather separate.  Here again the issue of censorship is rather different in the case that information is divulged on the understanding that it will not be communicated to third parties. The first ammendment certainly does not apply in this case as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the US proves.   The crux of the Spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of British law. The censorship aspect of it arose as a result of the government's ludicrous attempts to prevent summary of the case in the book.     Funny I saw that as a rejection of an assertion that you had made. Of course in rejecting an assertion I have to make a contrary assertion, since this assertion is unprovable I left it at that.   So far I have not seen you demonstrate a command of the contrary opinion to your own. You are attacking my anti-censorship view because I dare to accept the validity of some pro-censorship arguments while rejecting their conclusions.  Plus I am not an absolutist. I have this funny idea that the solution to this problem was not decided in 1789 by a group of white male gentry in secret session and sumarized in a single line. Furthermore I don't think that the issues are half as simple as you imply.   I don't think that you have geered your discourse to any audience save that of proving that you are the only person wearing a white hat. \",\"Has anyone use Snooper or MacEKG or any other similar diagnostic  software.Any comparisons/reviews on these products would be very much  appreciated.

Yes (2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000  running at 15.87 Mhz. (3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a  lot of memory. (4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors  that still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors  sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell  memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most  memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether  the Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine  California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB -  $140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that  are selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here. (5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an  average access time of about 25 ms. (6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a  backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move  your head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or  non-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.  Other things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay  for it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to  sell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about  $650. Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for  about $900.   The answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much.

They include the fact that the majority of the citizens are Israeli, the fact that Israel maintains religious freedom for all people, and the historical connection of Judaism to Jerusalem.   When Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 1948, the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visit religious shrines.  This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan, who did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control.  The Jordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city.  They turned a Jewish cemetary into a hotel, and used the gravestones in their latrines.   Israel has allowed individuals of all religions into Jerusalem, protected holy sites, and demonstrated its fitness to control the city.   Also, I should point out that Islam is not centered in Jerusalem, but has holy sites there.  The home of Islam is Mecca, where all Muslims should make a pilgramage (the hajj).  Unlike Israeli Jerusalem, Jews and Christians are not allowed in Saudi Mecca.  Adam  Adam Shostack            adam@das.harvard.edu\",\" Thanks for posting this and making it available.

David\",\"I recently bought an AMD 386/40.  The motherboard booklet says the board is a \\\"391 WB/H.\\\"  I have 4 1x3 simms on board.  The machine also uses a Super IDE I/O Card (model PT-604). (of course niether the motherboard or the I/O card booklet clearly state who the manufacurers are) I'm also using a Trident 8900C SVGA card.   Anyway, that's all of the pertinent info I can think of. My problem is that the computer often freezes or displays \\\"Parity Error -- System Halted\\\" messages depending on whether I set the Memory Parity Error Checking to \\\"disabled\\\" or \\\"enabled\\\" in the setup of the bios (makes sense). Its AMI bios (so it must be an AMI board?).   I just took it back to the dealer and they replaced all of the SIMMS but I keep getting the same error (more frequently now).  It all worked at the dealer and didn't start screwing up 'till I got home (figures).   I've tried to take out all of the SIMMS and even re-inserted them in reverse order, making sure that the connections were solid.   My suspicion jumps to this damn all in one HD controller/serial/ parallel/game-port I/O card, or to the motherboard (God forbid).   CAN ANYONE HELP?\",\"of   A transporter operator!?!?

On major highways, 3 or more lanes in each direction, keeping to the extreme right blocks folks who are entering. Also, as someone posted in this thread, here in the D.C. area we have a few left lane exits (sounds like 66). If you wait until the last minute to get in the left lane you won't, cause these yoyos won't make room.  We have a particularly bad strech here in Merryland just over the Cabin John bridge. There are two very long entry ramps which all the hurry-up yahoos dive into cause they want to get ahead. When we get to the point where these ramps merge, all hell breaks lose. The result is that traffic which was moving at 55 on the VA side of the bridge, stalls on t'other side. If these dingbats had stayed in lane, allowed the folks coming up the two ramps to merge, we would still be doing 55. Instead we do start- stop for 4 miles. Dave Barry's idea of a laser equipped car would be real useful here.  Bob\",\"I plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have working code, which I will also include.  The intersection of 3 planes method looks best, but my implementation based on a short article in  Graphics Gems I doesn't work.  I may be misinterpreting, of course.  I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better.  In either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solution of linear equations).  To get the planes, I was taking the midpoint of the line from, say, P1 to P2, and setting the normal as the \\\"normalized\\\" vector from P1 to P2. These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.  HOwever, the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points (for different tests).  My matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks like I need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, which will require bringing in another routine I don't have (but should be easy to find).  Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets of 3 points, and intersecting the normals from there.  This would also define the circle center.  However, small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not intersect.  Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a unique point if they are not parallel.

When a part is dropped from future production planning, such as the National MM-series white noise generators, camera sync generators, etc., it will disappear from current databooks although it still may be produced for a short time (or be available from stock somewhere). Now, if you have some old plans calling for such a device, or you have a dead gadget on your workbench and it has such a part in it, you'll know the functions so you can troubleshoot and substitute as necessary.  The old GE thyristor data books contain real good tutorials on SCR and triac applications that are not found elsewhere, for example.

How modern how daring how liberating How modern how daring how liberating they chant  The sophomore, being American Doesn't know That his ``question''     modern        skeptical            cynical  Was asked before, by a     modern        skeptical            cynical    urbane cosmopolitan  Politician (appointed not elected) Who happened to live two thousand years ago.  Like many politicians he cared      Less about ideals          than results      Less about ends          than means      Less about anything          than keeping his job               (and his head).  We might call him A bit brutal Though `firm' would be kinder (And no doubt Stalin, who let nobody go, laughed at his laxness) He didn't like his job; perhaps he no longer hoped for better (Nor feared worse, except regarding his head).  And when these wily Jews With their heads-I-win, tails-you-lose      conundrums Brought forth their madman, His first impulse was to play the Roman: ``I find nothing wrong with him,   See to it yourselves.''  But when they mentioned `King' and `Caesar' His heart froze.  If he killed their madman     He'd start a riot          and lose his job              (and his head)  If he saved the King of the Jews     He'd piss off Caesar          and lose his job              (and his head)  And when his wife told him to have    Nothing to do with the righteous lout She didn't tell him anything    He hadn't already figured out.  So he punted.  ``Not my jurisdiction!  Take him to see Herod!'' (who just happened to be in town....)  Herod appreciated the courtesy But wasn't worried         And sent the sharp-tongued fool      (Who suddenly didn't have much to say,     funny how people lose it under pressure....)   back In the attire proper   to his Royal State.  His ass is covered---if Herod has no problem, Caesar certainly won't.  The fool can be king of whatever world he wants as long as it's not Caesar's.  ``I'm letting him go,'' he said with a shout. (Looks like he'll last this one out....)  The crowd's reaction puzzled him.   They really wanted him dead. They didn't want the King of the Jews,   They wanted Barabbas instead (And, as Josephus records, they got him)  Oh well, he thought, They all look the same to me. And we'll get Barabbas next time.  And if I can get them to say    ``We have no king but Caesar!''    By killing a madman, Hell, I'll kill ten a day.

Acquiring weapons in Norway: You can buy (almost) all kinds of weapons in Norway, BUT you must have a  permit, and a good reason to get the permit.... If I would like to have a handgun, i would have to get an gun-licence from  the police and to be a member of a gun-club. The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and/or records of SERIOUS mental diseases. Now, if a got my licence, I would have to be an active member of the gun -club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun. It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ??? You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...  Use of guns in crimes (in Norway): Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms' for a long time, but these are rather the exeption. Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short  time befor the crime.  Use of knives: It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or 'open'. You (Americans) think it's ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open in public -rigth ??  Scandinavians ARE 'aggressive': We northeners are not as hot-livered as southeners, but when we decide to take action we DO. Ask ANY historian or millitary with an knowledge of europe.... (Or ask any German who served in Norway in WW2.....)  Individual vs masses: Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some extent.... Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ?? What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of  all the others ??   The issue: I believe the issue is GUNS, and gun-legislation. We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one.... IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME. But should it have to be like that ?? Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ?? If you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think it should be free to buy guns ??  Disclaim-her: I'm not a pacifist or anti gun.  I would defend my home, loved ones and country, but I don't view guns as neccities or toys. I HAVE done army service, and HAVE used a variaty of weapons, but wouldn't want to have one for self defence or because they 'feel good'....         This is not a .signature.

Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring and tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener and LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever scheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on  the frontend.  Also remember that, if I'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm equivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets dropped across that 600ohms.  That's fine until you're down to roughly 12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.

The blast is believed to be the work of a suicide bomber. Radio reports said a car packed with butane gas exploded between two parked buses, one belonging to the IDF and the other civilian. Both busses went up in flames. The blast killed an Arab man who worked at a nearby snack bar in the Mehola settlement. An Israel Radio report stated that the other man who was killed may have been the one who set off the bomb. According to officials at the Haemek Hospital in Afula, the eight IDF soldiers injured in the blast suffered light to moderate injuries.  \",\"Besides this was the same line of horse puckey the mining companies claimed when they were told to pay for  restoring land  after strip mining.  they still mine coal in the midwest,  but now it doesn't look like the moon when theyare done.\",\"Archive-name: x-faq/part1 Last-modified: 1993/04/04  This article and several following contain the answers to some Frequently Asked  Questions (FAQ) often seen in comp.windows.x.

The xpert mailing list is the general, public mailing list on X maintained by the X Consortium. The mailings are gatewayed, so xpert is almost  identical to the comp.windows.x Usenet newsgroup.    *** If you get comp.windows.x, you don't need to  ***  *** be added to the xpert mailing list.   ***   Otherwise, you can join the list to receive X information  electronically. It is best to find a local distribution; perhaps someone within your company is already receiving the mailing. As a last resort, send mail to  xpert-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with a valid return electronic address.    The xannounce mailing list carries major X announcements, such as new releases (including public patches from MIT), public reviews, adoption of  standards by the MIT X Consortium, and conference announcements.  It does NOT  carry advertisements, source code, patches, or questions.  If you already  receive the Usenet news group comp.windows.x.announce or the xpert mailing  list, you don't need to be added to the xannounce mailing list.  Otherwise, to  subscribe, send a request to xannounce-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu. Note: Only  redistribution addresses will be accepted for this list -- i.e. no personal  addresses. If you wish to receive xannounce yourself, please contact your mail  administrator to set up a local redistribution list and to put you on it.    comp.windows.x.apps is not gatewayed to a mailing list.   In addition, the X Consortium sponsors these public lists:   bug-clx         CLX bug reports and discussions   x-ada           X and ada   x11-3d          people interested in X and 3d graphics   ximage          people interested in image processing and X   xvideo          discussion of video extensions for X  To subscribe to one of these lists, assuming no-one in your  organization already receives it, send mail to <list>-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with the Subject line including the name of the LIST in caps and the request \\\"addition request\\\".  In the body of the message be sure to give an address for  your local distribution which is accessible from MIT (eddie.mit.edu).

The FAQ in alt.binaries.pictures contains information on viewing images with X and on massaging image formats.  The FAQ in comp.mail.mh (gatewayed to MH-users@ics.uci.edu) includes a  section on xmh.  The FAQ in comp.lang.lisp contains information on several interface tools and toolkits.  There exists a PEX/PHiGS FAQ.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   7)  How do I ask a net-question so as to maximize helpful responses?   When asking for help on the net or X mailing lists, be sure to include  all information about your setup and what you are doing.  The more specific you are, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without all the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are able to respond at all.   Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it  from. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system, give details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S  version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to  mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.   Then tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what you expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the  exact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote  doesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary  (just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available?   The trade magazines (Unix World, Unix Review, Computer Language, etc.) are publishing more articles on X.  Two X-specific publications include:   - O'Reilly and Associates publishes \\\"The X Resource: A Practical  Journal of the X Window System\\\" (103 Morris St. #A, Sebastapol, CA 95472).   Editorial information: Adrian Nye, adrian@ora.com.   - The X Journal is started bi-monthly publication September 1991 on a  variety of X topics. Subscription information: The X Journal, Subscriber  Services, Dept XXX, P.O. Box 3000, Denville, NJ 07834, USA. Editorial  information: editors%topgun@uunet.uu.net.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   9)  What are these common abbreviations/acronyms?   Xt: The X Toolkit Intrinsics is a library layered on Xlib which  provides the functionality from which the widget sets are built. An \\\"Xt-based\\\"  program is an application which uses one of those widget sets and which uses  Intrinsics mechanisms to manipulate the widgets.  Xmu: The Xmu library is a collection of Miscellaneous Utility functions useful in building various applications and widgets.  Xaw: The Athena Widget Set is the MIT-implemented sample widget set distributed with X11 source.  Xm: The OSF/Motif widget set from the Open Software Foundation; binary kits are available from many hardware vendors.  Xhp (Xw): The Hewlett-Packard Widget Set was originally based on R2++,  but several sets of patches exist which bring it up to R3, as it is distributed on the X11R4 tapes. Supplemental patches are available to use it with R4/R5.  CLX: The Common Lisp X Interface is a Common Lisp equivalent to Xlib.  XDMCP: The X Display Manager Protocol provides a uniform mechanism for  a display such as an X terminal to request login service from a remote host.  XLFD: The X Logical Font Description Conventions describes a standard logical font description and conventions to be used by clients so that they can query and access those resources.  RTFM: Common expert-speak meaning \\\"please locate and consult the  relevant documentation -- Read the Forgotten Manual\\\".  UTSL: A common expression meaning \\\"take advantage of the fact that you  aren't limited by a binary license -- Use The Source, Luke\\\".  API: Application-Programmer Interface. The function calls, etc., in a programming library.  BDF: Bitmap Distribution Format; a human-readable format for uncompiled X fonts.  GUI: graphical user interface.  UIL: the User Interface Language, part of OSF/Motif which lets  programmers specify a widget hierarchy in a simple \\\"outline\\\" form  WCL: the Widget Creation Language, a package which extends the  understanding of the Xt resource format such that a widget hierarchy and  actions on the widgets can be specified through the resources file  GIL: the file format put out by Sun's OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0  UIMS: User Interface Management System  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  10)  What is the ICCCM? (How do I write X-friendly applications?)   The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the  official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It  describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with  other clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need  to read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the  selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window  manager.  Get it either:  - as part of the R4 distribution from MIT  - in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys \\\"X Window System\\\" book  - as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, \\\"X Protocol Reference Manual.\\\" A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.  The version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to  the efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the  presentation.  [from David Rosenthal, 10/90]   - the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's \\\"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5\\\". The complete document is on the R5 tapes.   Alternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in \\\"RTFM\\\" and is the most-important of the least-read X documents.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?   The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of  cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software  interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.  MIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and  administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the  Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership,  Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).  Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail,  with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape, interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.   Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with  others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification is produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium as a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public  review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.  Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or  Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.  Write to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer  Science, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.  [For complete information see the XCONSORTIUM man page from the X11R4 distribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?   OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK was developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was developed by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF  members.    OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide;  there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications. Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the  one from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce  programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's  (formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a \\\"virtual toolkit\\\" which provides objects in the style of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.   OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising  their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.  [Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?   Open Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system  that combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface  specification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including the SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and a number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).  [thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?   DECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI  toolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a  session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar,  dxpsview, etc.).  (At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.) [8/90]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  15)  What is PEX?   PEX is the \\\"PHiGS Extension to X\\\".  PHiGS stands for \\\"Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics  System\\\" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation  and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in  hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension  allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized  hardware for 3D graphics.  Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely  redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample implementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release. Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for  their workstations and X terminals.  [last modified 10/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  16)  What is \\\"low-bandwidth X\\\" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?  There are several options for using X over serial lines:  SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP packets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years, and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations. Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really  ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per  packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully  so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links).   CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the  40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do  anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help, but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed  data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).  PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than SLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial  line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for  running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable.  XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition  to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes  redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and  using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a  pseudo-X server or \\\"proxy\\\" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There  are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:    (1) You don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't   otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly   connected), and    (2) It reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that  have to cross the serial interface, and    (3) In addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering   packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for   blocks to compress.  LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a standard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using  NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information  (e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps,  etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a  Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample  implementation available in R6.  Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/ in the following files:         XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote         XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX  [information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]   There is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk at the 7th MIT X Technical Conference.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?   The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the X window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is no single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways  for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout, decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order (generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):   wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3  uwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed,  although it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.  twm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window  managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a re-parenting window manager.   awm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers  cwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system.   rtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.  dxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering  hpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm  mwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit  tekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering   olwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style Guide functionality  olwm (AT&T): ditto  gwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in Lisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on avahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]  m_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape  pswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release  swm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple GUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes from the resources file  twm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked twm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape  vtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a single-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available on archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available  from export. [3/92]  tvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is available on archive servers  olvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is  available on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.  mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version is floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a  source license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].  NCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look   XDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals   ctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5  twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export. Version 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.  vuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.  4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM  piewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?   It needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your  window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X  session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your  window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in the background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:   exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action. Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window,  whether or not you kill or restart your window manager.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?   Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature -- which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the geometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something  close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are  looking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces.  Look for the application \\\"xplaces\\\" on an archive-server near you. There are  several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage. [10/90]  Some new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the  saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running applications and the resource database.  [Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?   DEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this,  add to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:  sm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?   You can turn auto-repeat on or off by using \\\"xset r on|off\\\". The X protocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is a capability not supported by all systems.  Some servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over  server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the  server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server  from MIT with the options \\\"-ar1 350 -ar2 30\\\" to reduce the sensitivity of the  keyboard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?   There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful  for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and  does not do \\\"macro expansion.\\\"  Some (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors,  accept a translation resource such as:  xterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\\\   <Key>F1: string(\\\"setenv DISPLAY unix:0\\\") which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control characters in the string, use \\\\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include.  Window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor has a special \\\"remapper\\\" client been made available.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  David B.

They aren't even real.  What scientists call an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes  certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings.  All of which is subjective.    What is objective, though, is the approach a scientist  takes in discussing his model and his observations.  There is no objective science.  But there is an objective approach which is subjectively selected by the scientist.  Objective in this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules that he and his colleagues use to discuss their science.  This is in contrast to your Objective Morality.  There may be an objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on morality.  But there exists no objective morality.  Also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of  the physical world around us.  In that the method of discussion is objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ).  Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes of what we can observe.  It simply gives us a way to discuss our surroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.  I think it was Neils Bohr who said (to paraphrase) Science is what we can _say_ about the physical world.\",\" Legal or not, I've seen it done.  Phone records were obtained in order to *establish* probable cause, rather than as a result of it. In other words, for a fishing expedition.     And does the phone company require written, subpoena-able evidence of probable cause in order to process the request?  I suggest that the officer was disinterested in pursuing your case -- even if you could prove the offender had called you at a certain time, your  chances of winning a harassment suit on the strength of this evidence are nil.  My contact with several people who have dealt with cases of extreme phone harassment (several thousand calls in one case) teaches  me that police in this area are quite lethargic about pursuing such matters. \",\"nan\",\" I feel like Winston Churchill in 1941 :( ...... but, the privacy Clipper will, TO THE EXTENT KEY ESCROW IS LEGITIMATE, stop most of the abuse of wiretaps by local cops, company cops, angry husbands/ wives, etc...

As a result of the spacecraft entering Contingency Mode on April 9, all payload instruments were automatically powered off by on-board fault protection software.  Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memory was successfully reloaded on Monday, April 19.  To prepare for Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight Sequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of Payload Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning beginning at 10:30 AM.  Over this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands to perform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data for analysis by the Navigation Team.  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator testing will take place on Monday .  The Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday, April 25, with activation at Midnight, Monday evening April 26.  C9 has been modified to include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due to Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrument calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument. This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements which occur during approach and mapping phases. MAG Cals will require the sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin state and perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data points in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations.\",\"I have attached a copy of an announcement I picked up during my trip to Moscow last week.  I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation Institute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original announcement.)   For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems. Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev, Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.  I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines for future space craft use.  If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it's faculty have e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the receiver to get the message.  They are still a bit antiquated - but they are rapidly changing!

I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master.    In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives  when performing diagnostics.    There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way  interface connector. They have the following functions and are described  in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper  described nearest the 40 way interface connector.  LK2: LED       When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the      interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An      external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with      the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will      be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130      Ohms ot 220 Ohms.  LK1: Dual Drives      This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single      bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,      indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.  LK4: Master      When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If      there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be      jumpered in this way.  LK5: IOChRdy      When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is       fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher      data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per      second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally       fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per      second.     There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s) may be jumpered:       Master, single drive with LED on interface  LK2 & LK4 fitted.      Master, single drive without LED on interface LK4 only fitted.      Master, dual drive without LED on interface LK4 & LK1 fitted.      Slave, dual drive without LED on interface  No jumpers fitted.      Master, dual drive with LED on interface  LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.      Slave, dual drive with LED on interface  LK2 only fitted.     The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.     The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way  connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the  drive for this LED driver.

The toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5's i18n facility. As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's  X11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit uses Xsi.  Our toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system. In order to do that, the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed to character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with  ASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout and application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese', each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.  We need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters from the top are the same character set and what the character set is.  We could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, used Xsi's internal functions to construct that function. The following is the source code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet()'.   //I18N.h // This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*- // $Id: I18N.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $  #ifndef _I18N_H #define _I18N_H  #include <X11/Xlib.h>  extern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str, /* IN */      int wc_len,  /* IN */      char *buf,  /* OUT */      int *buflen,  /* IN/OUT */      int *scanned_len, /* OUT */      char **charset); /* OUT */ extern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str); extern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc);  #endif /* _I18N_H */  //I18N.cc /* $Id: I18N.cc,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima Exp $ */  #include <stdlib.h> #include <X11/Xlibint.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include \\\"I18N.h\\\"  extern \\\"C\\\" { #include <X11/wchar.h> #define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs #define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid #include \\\"Xlocaleint.h\\\" #undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #undef _Xmbfscs #undef _Xmbctidtocsid     extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale, const wchar_t*, int,       char*, int*, int*, int*);     extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);     extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID); };  int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */      int wc_len,  /* IN */      char *buf,  /* OUT */      int *buf_len,  /* IN/OUT */      int *scanned_len, /* OUT */      char **charset) /* OUT */ {     XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();     int ctid;     int status;     Charset *xcharset;          status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf,            buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);     if (status == Success) {  xcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid));  *charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;     }     else  *charset = NULL;     return status; } ----------------  An included file above, \\\"Xlocaleint.h\\\", is also Xsi internal and we copied the file to the toolkit directory and compiled.  A serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on our HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01.  When we tried to link an application based on our toolkit, link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:     _Xmbctidtocsid (code)     _Xmbfscs (code)     _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)     _XFallBackConvert (code)  We had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until HP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that because HP did not release HP's X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to  know how HP's R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi's popularity and used  its internal functions.   The HP's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented. We observe from HP's libX11.a, they used some Ximp implementation but we are not sure if they used MIT's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and therefore, finding just counter part functions in MIT's Ximp for Xsi does not seem to lead us a solution.  My question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like 'decomposeCharacterset()' listed above. Is there any function to check character set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales? If it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we want to use any internal functions in HP's X11R5 as we did for MIT's R5.  In order to render a 'wchar_t' type string, there must be some machinery to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for the string. We have no way to find out that without any HP's X11R5 source  files. We want to know how we can use that for our goal.  Any help or comments would be highly appreciated.  I also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area even if it is not HP's implementation.
